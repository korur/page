Things get easier after the first step. Because the mind actually stops wandering and starts building things. How can you run a marathon if you don't know where the start line is?

Whatever your ambition is take that first step now. Imagining creates the vision, doing creates the product. 

Hi, I am Serdar! here is my camp for Data science projects.

Here, I try to solve problems that I find interesting using Data Science. It is my starting line. What is more is the challenges I faced and the lessons learned in my journey.  There were situations it was not easy to find the relevant guides or ways of doing. So I had to figure out from scratch. I share them too. And doing so spark new ideas as well! Most done in R. Some Python.

Letâ€™s dive in.
