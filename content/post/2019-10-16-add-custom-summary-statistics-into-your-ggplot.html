<p>It is hard to understand your data by looking at the numbers on a csv file. You need to plot it. And adding informative statistics to your plots will make it easier.</p>
<p>To evaluate data, we typically use <strong>mean</strong> and <strong>median</strong> to define its central tendency and <strong>range, quartiles, variance</strong> and <strong>standard deviation</strong> to define how spread it is.</p>
<p><strong>Mean</strong> and <strong>standard deviation</strong> is a good representation of the data if we don’t have extreme values that result in a skewed distribution. On the other hand, when we have extreme values they might misguide us. In those conditions, <code>median</code> and <code>quartiles</code> will serve us better.</p>
<p><strong>Median</strong> is the central point which divides the data into half. <strong>Quartiles</strong> are used to describe the spread of the data. The word comes from the Medieval Latin “quartilis” which means fourth and <strong>quartiles break the data into four equal parts</strong>.</p>
<p>{{% alert note %}}
The advantage is that they are much less effected by the outliers or skeweness of the data.
{{% /alert %}}</p>
<p>For this reason, <strong>quartiles are often used along with the median as the best measures of spread.</strong></p>
<p>They are often expressed as an <strong>Interquartile range (IQR)</strong>, which is the interval between first and third quartiles and represents 50% of the data points.</p>
<p>For example, you measured height of adults in a population, with Interquartile range you can describe a discrete interval centered around the median including 50% of the measurements.</p>
<p>Here is a representative graph.<img src="/img/quartiles.png" alt="graph:wikipedia" />[source:wikipedia]</p>
<div id="how-to-include-statistics-in-ggplot2" class="section level1">
<h1>How to include statistics in ggplot2</h1>
<p>Stats makes it easier to grasp the data. And <strong>different statistics are suited for different data types</strong>. For example, you may want to show <code>a 95% confidence interval? mean? median?</code> or any other statistics which captures the details best for your data in the hand.</p>
<p><strong>So let’s go through on an example data.</strong> The data is about the effects of two Herbicides (glyphosate &amp; bentazone) on the yield of white mustard (Sinapis alba) seeds.</p>
<p>First, import ggplot2 package and read in the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
path &lt;- &quot;C:/Users/serda/Downloads/S.alba.csv&quot;
data &lt;- read.csv(path)
str(data)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &#39;data.frame&#39;:    68 obs. of  4 variables:
##  $ X        : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
##  $ Dose     : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 ...
##  $ Herbicide: Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Bentazone&quot;,&quot;Glyphosate&quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...
##  $ DryMatter: num  4.7 4.6 4.1 4.4 3.2 3 3.8 3.9 3.8 3.8 ...</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>path &lt;- &quot;C:/Users/serda/Downloads/S.alba.csv&quot;
data &lt;- read.csv(path)
str(data)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &#39;data.frame&#39;:    68 obs. of  4 variables:
##  $ X        : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
##  $ Dose     : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 ...
##  $ Herbicide: Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Bentazone&quot;,&quot;Glyphosate&quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...
##  $ DryMatter: num  4.7 4.6 4.1 4.4 3.2 3 3.8 3.9 3.8 3.8 ...</code></pre>
<p>These chemicals used at 8 different doses and the yield is measured. I will convert the dose variable as a factor.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data$Dose &lt;- as.factor(data$Dose)
levels(data$Dose)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;0&quot;   &quot;10&quot;  &quot;20&quot;  &quot;40&quot;  &quot;80&quot;  &quot;160&quot; &quot;320&quot; &quot;640&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We can make an initial plot to visualize the data. We’ll plot the yield variable <code>DryMatter</code> against <code>Dose</code> of the Herbicides. We can assign <code>col</code> argument to map different chemical compounds to different colors.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># I will define a dodge and jitterdodge object to avoid overlapping data points or stats that we will overlay later
posn.d &lt;- position_dodge(width=0.2)
posn.jd &lt;- position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.1, dodge.width=0.2)
p &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x=Dose, y=DryMatter, col=Herbicide, fill=Herbicide, group=Herbicide ))
p + geom_point(position =posn.jd)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-10-16-add-custom-summary-statistics-into-your-ggplot_files/figure-html/visualize%20the%20data-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>What we see here is that, at low doses both Herbicides led similar yields but starting from Dose 40 we see a drastic negative impact of Benzoate on yield.</p>
<p>On top of that plot, I want to overlay the <code>min</code>, <code>max</code> and also <code>median</code> and <code>Interquartile range</code> for each set of yield measurements.</p>
<p>I need one function to calculate the <strong>median</strong> and the <strong>interquartile range(IQR) 1-3</strong>, and another to calculate min(), max() values.</p>
<p>{{% alert warning %}}
In order to use the results of a function directly in ggplot2 we need to <strong>ensure that the names of the variables match the aesthetics needed for our respective geoms</strong>.
{{% /alert %}}</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Function for median and IQR

median_IQR &lt;- function(x) {
  data.frame(y = median(x), # Median
             ymin = quantile(x)[2], # 1st quartile
             ymax = quantile(x)[4])  # 3rd quartile
}

# Function for min, max values
range &lt;- function(x) {
  data.frame(ymin=min(x),
             ymax=max(x))
}</code></pre>
<p>Let’s replot with the statistics we wanted to overlay. You can use two<code>stat_summary()</code> layers to add our stats. You can set the <code>fun.data</code> argument to the specific function defined above.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Updated plot
p + stat_summary(geom = &quot;linerange&quot;, fun.data = median_IQR, position = posn.d, size=3) + stat_summary(geom = &quot;linerange&quot;, fun.data = range, position = posn.d, size=3, alpha=0.5)+ stat_summary(geom = &quot;point&quot;, fun.y = &quot;median&quot;, position = posn.d, size = 3, col = &quot;black&quot;, shape = &quot;X&quot;)</code></pre>

<div id="conclusions" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Ggplot2 is a flexible package and knowing its intricacies will help you level up your visuals and gather better insights.</p>
<p>To understand your data and to convey the insights you want to point out, you can include your choice of custom functions in ggplot <code>stat_summary()</code> layer similarly as we did above.</p>
<p>The data we have here was small. With bigger data, it will be more crucial to overlay summary statistics for effective visuals.</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>
