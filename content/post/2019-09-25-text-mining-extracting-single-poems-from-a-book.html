<p>My ambitious goal is to write a machine learning algorithm that predicts authors. But let’s start with something simpler. An important part in a Data Science workflow is data preparation. <strong>Clean it, reformat it and make it usable for further analysis.</strong></p>
<p>I will work on a Poetry book called “New Poems” from D. H. Lawrence. You can download it from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg website</a> which is a library of over 60,000 free eBooks.</p>
<p><strong>The goal is to isolate each poem individually for text mining analysis.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s figure out a solution.</p>
<p>{{% alert note %}}
I will use the table of contents section to <strong>fish out each poem separately</strong> by using two <strong>for loops.</strong>

<h3>Copy the book from DH Lawrence “New Poems”</h3>
<p>At gutenberg website there are couple of slightly different formats of the book. Since there were some mistakes in the .txt file I used
the html version <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22726/22726-h/22726-h.htm">here</a>. I copied the text and pasted it in a text editor and saved to my working directory.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lawrence &lt;- readLines(&quot;posts_data/lawrence_new_poems.txt&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Our file contains <code>2181</code> lines. With square brackets [ ] we can view the lines we want. Let’s look at the first few lines;</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lawrence[1:5]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;&quot;

## [3] &quot;&quot;                                                                    
## [4] &quot;This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with&quot;

<p>The <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22726/22726-h/22726-h.htm">book</a> has 42 poems in total. Table of contents (TOC) starts with the line “CONTENTS” and ends with the line “ON THAT DAY”.</p>
<p>I will use those lines to extract the TOC. Stringr package comes in handy here. <strong>str_which()</strong> function returns line index numbers for a given term.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>start &lt;- str_which(lawrence, pattern = fixed(&quot;CONTENTS&quot;))
start</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 53</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>lawrence[start]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;CONTENTS&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># We are choosing first appearance of &quot;ON THAT DAY&quot; with [1] because it appears 
# also in the Poem title later.
end &lt;-  str_which(lawrence, pattern = fixed(&quot;ON THAT DAY&quot;))[1]
end</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 137</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>lawrence[end]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;ON THAT DAY&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Slicing the lines from <code>54</code> to <code>137</code> will give us the TOC.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>TOC &lt;- lawrence[(start+1):(end)]</code></pre>
<p>To remove empty spaces I will use here <strong>stri_remove_empty()</strong> function from <strong>stringi</strong> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>TOC &lt;- stri_remove_empty(TOC)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s look at how the clean TOC looks.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>TOC </code></pre>

<p>Next, we will extract main text containing only the poems without TOC and other metadata. We need to slice the document starting from the end of the contents <code>(end)</code> till end of the last poem.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># After the last poem some metadata starts with &quot;End of the Project...&quot;
# We will slice until this line
end_main &lt;- str_which(lawrence, &quot;End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of New Poems, by D. H. Lawrence&quot;)
# Capture main text
lawrence_body &lt;- lawrence[(end+1):(end_main -1)]</code></pre>
<p>Now, we have TOC and main body of the book as two separate objects.</p>
</div>
<div id="first-for-loop" class="section level3">
<h3>First for loop</h3>
<p>We will use TOC and a <code>for loop</code> to get the index numbers of the title’s of each poem.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># First initiate an empty list
index &lt;- list()
# For loop
for (i in 1:42) {
index[[i]] &lt;- str_which(lawrence_body, pattern = TOC[i])
}

index&lt;- unlist(index)
index</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]    9   37   59   82  110  126  164  192  209  253  276  314  332  347
## [15]  387  428  473  496  536  570  593  621  768  664  707  745  621  768
## [29]  901  933  958  990 1057 1100 1193 1253 1286 1313 1376 1502 1527 1571
## [43] 1606 1644</code></pre>
<p>The <code>for loop</code> we created here uses each title in TOC as a pattern inside a <strong>str_which()</strong> function to find the index number where it detects this pattern.</p>
<p>For example TOC[1] will use the title of first poem as a pattern and it will return the line number where the poem starts. <strong>At the end, we will have a list of starting lines of each poem.</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>TOC[1]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;APPREHENSION&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>str_which(lawrence_body, pattern = TOC[1])</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 9</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># e.g. The poem Apprehension starts at line index number 9</code></pre>
<p>Selecting the lines from the beginning of the <strong>first poem</strong> until the beginning of the <strong>second poem</strong> will give us the first poem. By iterating everything by +1 we will capture all 42 poems.</p>
<p>Since the title EMBANKMENT AT NIGHT appears in the titles of two poems we will do a slight correction here. To correct this, I will remove first apperance of index 768 and second appearence of 621.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>index &lt;- index[-c(23,27)]
index</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]    9   37   59   82  110  126  164  192  209  253  276  314  332  347
## [15]  387  428  473  496  536  570  593  621  664  707  745  768  901  933

<pre class="r"><code>length(index)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 42</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Not to miss the last poem, I have to add the line index of the
# end of the main text. We can use the end of the main body as above.
index[43] &lt;- end_main -1</code></pre>
<p>Now, we have 42 index numbers matching the title of each poem 1 index number to label the end of the main text. We will use those to extract poems separetely.</p>
</div>
<div id="second-for-loop" class="section level3">
<h3>Second for loop</h3>
<p>It’s time for the trick. Finally we can capture each 42 poem separately in a list by using a second <code>for loop.</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create an empty list: poems
poems &lt;- list()
for (i in 1:42) {
    
    poems[[i]] &lt;- lawrence_body[(index[i]:index[i+1]-1)]

## APPREHENSION

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p><strong>Data Preparation</strong> is a crucial step in Data Science as data comes rarely ready to use.</p>
<p>Here, starting from a Poetry Book I isolated each poem separately in a list. Hard part is done. <strong>Now, I can identify how many rhymes each poem contains, word usage across different poems, the similarities between them and many more to gain insights about the author.</strong></p>
<p>I could also analyze the whole book as a single document but by isolating each element I will gain much deeper insight from the data.</p>
<p>Do you apply similar techniques to isolate chapters or sections from the book or documents to compare and contrast different parts?</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this post. Please feel free to comment below with your thoughts/feedback.</p>
