This guide will help you to get your website online in a few minutes. Then, customize and add your own material in RStudio environment, push it to your Github repository and benefit from the continous deployment feature of Netlify. 
It took me many days of work, reading tens of blog posts, YouTube videos and a lot of testing to figure out all of this. 
   
Here is an up to date workflow of **how I created my Blog on Github and deployed at Netlify.**


### Tools we need;  

* RStudio
* Hugo
* Blogdown
* Git
* Github
* Netlify

Hugo is the actual website builder and [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) is an R package that allows us to use Hugo in R environment.   

### On RStudio
  
* Select **Projects** menu on the top right corner 
* Select **New Project > Choose existing directory > Browse to Website folder**
  
  
#### Install Hugo and Blogdown
 
```devtools::install_github("rstudio/blogdown")```
```library(blogdown)```
```install_hugo() ```
    
  
#### Build your website locally. 
  
For example, to create a new site with the academic theme;  
  
```blogdown::new_site(theme = "gcushen/hugo-academic")```  
 
For other themes go to http://themes.gohugo.io, choose a theme you like, click homepage and you will be redirected to its github repository.    
Replace this **repository name** with "**gcushen/hugo-academic**" above)  
  
Use **list.files()** to see the files/folders generated.
  
To be able to publish the website on github we need to specify a **docs** folder instead of the default public folder where the website is created.
  
Open your **config.toml** file under the Website folder, and add the lines; <a id="editconfig"></a>  

```baseurl: "https://yourusername.github.io/page/"```  
```publishDir = "docs"```
![configtoml](/img/configtoml.jpg) 

Save the config file. This will rebuild the site and create the docs folder.
Now you can go back to your folder and delete the public directory. 


### On Github account 

#### Create a new repository 

Log in to your Github account and create a new repository.
Here I called it ````page.````
Then your remote repository will be at    
* https://github.com/yourusername/page.git 
Copy that link.

### On Git  
#### Create your local .git repository

  
By using pwd and cd commands navigate your directory to the Website folder
  
Initialize your local repository    
```git init```  
Use the copied link from above  
```git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/page.git```       
```git add .  ``` 
```git commit -m createmywebsite```   

Following command will synchronize all your files to your Github repository  
  
```git push origin master```  

  
### Publishing your website on Github pages  

  
1. In your Github repository. Go to settings   
2. Scroll down to Github pages, choose source > **master branch/docs** folder
3. This will update the page. Scroll down to Github pages again click the link:    
e.g.   https://yourusername.github.io/page/.


**Hoorray! In this step your website should be up and running on Github!**  


### Deploying your Website to Netlify


If you want to benefit from the advantages like continous deployment you can 
use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 
 
Go to your **Netlify**, Click ```Get started for free```, and sign up with Github.

* Choose __New site from Git__
* Choose __GitHub__ at the bottom
* Click on __Configure the Netlify app on GitHub.__
* On github select your target repository. Save.
* On Netlify pick up that repository.
* Modify Basic build settings: __Publish directory__ should be __docs__
* Click on **Show advanced** > New Variable  
* Add a New Variable   
Modify as Key = HUGO_VERSION and Value = 0.58.1  
***This step is important otherwise your site will not be built.***  

If you dont know your hugo version; on Rstudio > type  

```blogdown::hugo_version()```

* Click __Deploy__

It will allocate you a random link. You have to go back to your config.toml and modify baseurl as we did for Github [above](#editconfig) but with this netlify link this time.  

After this step you have to push changes to github from your local git.
 
Similarly to the steps above without ```git init``` this time.

Netlify will detect those changes you pushed to your github repository and your site will be published in a few seconds.

**Hoorray! In this step your website should be up and running on Netlify!** 

### How to use your own domain name

#### Go to your domain provider e.g on Go Daddy 

My Products > Scroll down to your domain > Click DNS  

Create new or modify if existing an A record pointing your root domain to Netlify load balancerâ€™s IP address 104.198.14.52 as in below;
![arecord](/img/Arecord.jpg) 

#### Go to domain settings on your deploy at Netlify  

* Add custom domain 
* Fill in your domain name   
* Click Verify >  Yes, add domain > Verify DNS configuration

**Voila, in this step your website should be online at www.yourdomain.com!!**
