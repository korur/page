      <description>&lt;p&gt;Things get easier after the first step. Because the mind actually stops wandering and starts building things. How can you run a marathon if you don&amp;rsquo;t know where the start line is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever your ambition is take that first step now. Imagining creates the vision, doing creates the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, I am Serdar! here is my camp for Data science projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I try to solve problems that I find interesting using Data Science. It is my starting line. What is more is the challenges I faced and the lessons learned in my journey.  There were situations it was not easy to find the relevant guides or ways of doing. So I had to figure out from scratch. I share them too. And doing so spark new ideas as well! Most done in R. Some Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letâ€™s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
