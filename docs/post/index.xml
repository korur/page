&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/kindlebat.png&#34; alt=&#34;configtoml&#34; /&gt;
As I read on my kindle I highlight the passages that I like so that I can re-read them later. These annotations are stored on my Kindle and are backed up at Amazon. And after some time, they started to accumulate and became some kind of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came up with an idea to analyze all those text I highlighted on my kindle, &lt;strong&gt;to figure out what kind of content I was most likely to highlight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan was to use text mining and sentiment analysis, generate insights and compare them to my real opinions of those books. &lt;strong&gt;So I can have the first-hand test of how useful text mining is. With that knowledge, I can be more convinced when I apply the method to a business problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to be objective, I will create an independent character called ‚Äúthe bat‚Äù. He is a hacker and he is not the bookworm type but his unfortunate fate gave him a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His next mission is to hack my data and analyze it to gather insights for selling me more books.
The room was in a mess when he entered. As he plugged the USB drive on his laptop, he barely heard the radio which was still on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reporter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the moment we switch on the early morning our cell phones to deal with the flood of information in some form of a whatsapp or facebook message or a tweet until we fall asleep at night overwriting or reading a product review we leave bread crumbs to our personal flavors on internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many businesses use this unstructured data to drive their sales by better marketing through targeted product recommendations or to segregate their customers‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He squeezed his teeth when he saw the data of 21000 lines of text from 28 books. His first encounter was the book ‚ÄúMindset‚Äù by Carol Dweck, where she introduces the concept of growth mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long lines of text made him tired, he didn‚Äôt realize how the time passed. &lt;strong&gt;He decided to learn text mining&lt;/strong&gt;. This might sound quite a bit investment but now he is a man of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continued to learn R packages needed for text mining, he didn‚Äôt like the package name tidytext but he was slightly losing his prejudices. It was a long night. He fell asleep on his table as the sun slowly rose.
It was lightning my back garden where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could glance from time to time to the trees painted by the snow overnight ‚õÑÔ∏è. Without an idea about how things went on the another part of the town, I continued to read and highlight my kindle as I zip from a glass of red wine üç∑.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how the exported kindle highlights look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/kindleclip.png&#34; alt=&#34;configtoml&#34; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hacker‚Äôs notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He noted down each step of his text mining plan carefully. Let me help you go through them.
Reading and parsing the text file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Use readLines function to parse the text file

highlights &amp;lt;- readLines(&amp;quot;posts_data/Kindle_highlights_Serdar.Rmd&amp;quot;, encoding = &amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;)

# Create a dataframe where each row is a line from the text

df &amp;lt;- data.frame(highlights)

# Packages

library(tidyverse)   # includes ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats
library(tidytext)
library(wordcloud2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every data science project, there is some sort of data preparation. &lt;strong&gt;Stop words&lt;/strong&gt; are generally the most common words in a language and are usually filtered out before processing of text data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs look at the stop_words dataset from the tidytext package. Since it is a long list of words (&amp;gt;1K) &lt;strong&gt;I will print every fifth word as an example.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data(stop_words)

# print every 50th word 

stop_words_small &amp;lt;- stop_words[seq(1, nrow(stop_words), 50),]

stop_words_small %&amp;gt;% print(n=50)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 23 x 2
##    word       lexicon 
##    &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;   
##  1 a          SMART   
##  2 at         SMART   
##  3 contain    SMART   
##  4 few        SMART   
##  5 hers       SMART   
##  6 last       SMART   
##  7 nine       SMART   
##  8 presumably SMART   
##  9 some       SMART   
## 10 they&amp;#39;d     SMART   
## 11 very       SMART   
## 12 without    SMART   
## 13 what       snowball
## 14 they&amp;#39;ll    snowball
## 15 during     snowball
## 16 again      onix    
## 17 but        onix    
## 18 finds      onix    
## 19 if         onix    
## 20 much       onix    
## 21 parted     onix    
## 22 since      onix    
## 23 under      onix&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes even a small dot can have big influence on your results. &lt;strong&gt;Looking carefully I see that stop_words uses single quotes whereas in the text file used apostrophes (‚Äò).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.g.¬†they‚Äôll in stop_words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how the word they‚Äôll appears in the text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 200
Memories are continually revised, along with the meaning we derive from them, so that in the future they‚Äôll be of even more use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incompatibility will prevent some of the stop_words such as they‚Äôll, don‚Äôt, can‚Äôt e.g.¬†getting filtered. To prevent this we have to replace them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He quickly spotted that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;str_replace_all() function from Stringr will do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;df$highlights &amp;lt;- str_replace_all(df$highlights, &amp;quot;‚Äô&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;#39;&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the text is ready for the frequency analysis. Words in a text mining project are called tokens. We can split the text into single words by unnest_tokens() function from tidytext package, filter the stop_words and count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;df &amp;lt;- df %&amp;gt;% unnest_tokens(word, highlights) %&amp;gt;%
             anti_join(stop_words) %&amp;gt;% 
             filter(!word %in% c(&amp;quot;highlights&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;highlight&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;page&amp;quot;, 
                      &amp;quot;location&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;yellow&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pink&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;orange&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also added here some additional words which frequently appear in kindle highlights output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dplyr()&lt;/strong&gt; package functions are very useful for grouping and counting the words from the lists that are created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;top_kindle_highlights &amp;lt;- df %&amp;gt;% 
 group_by(word) %&amp;gt;% 
 count() %&amp;gt;% 
 arrange(desc(n))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He noted down his first insight. &lt;strong&gt;10 most frequent words from my kindle highlights.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;top_kindle_highlights&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 12,433 x 2
## # Groups:   word [12,433]
##    word       n
##    &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;
##  1 people   592
##  2 story    340
##  3 life     318
##  4 time     309
##  5 mind     213
##  6 change   212
##  7 feel     211
##  8 world    171
##  9 person   170
## 10 habits   157
## # ... with 12,423 more rows&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordclouds are a good alternative to long lists of words for visualizing text data. Wordcloud2 package allows you to use any image as the markup.&lt;img src=&#34;/img/h7.png&#34; alt=&#34;configtoml&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wordcloud2(top_kindle_highlights, figPath = bat, size = 1, backgroundColor = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;, color = color_vector(data$freq) )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ideas started to get shaped in his mind. He thought who made those highlights is someone interested in storytelling, writing and good communication, good habits, and people. &lt;strong&gt;Someone who wants to influence his life in a positive way. He was becoming more and more interested in the books.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wanted to dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bigram Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single words are a good starting point what the books were about. &lt;strong&gt;But they are not very informative without context.&lt;/strong&gt; Frequency analysis can also be performed to measure how often pairs of two words &lt;strong&gt;(bigrams)&lt;/strong&gt; occur in the text. This allows us to capture finer details in the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this he combined the unnested single tokens which is isolated above back into a continuous text and then performed bigram analysis. You can use &lt;strong&gt;str_c()&lt;/strong&gt; function from stringr package to concatenate the single words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Recreate the df
df &amp;lt;- data.frame(highlights)
df$highlights &amp;lt;- str_replace_all(df$highlights, &amp;quot;‚Äô&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;#39;&amp;quot;)

df &amp;lt;- df %&amp;gt;% unnest_tokens(word, highlights) %&amp;gt;% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %&amp;gt;% 
 filter(!word %in% c(&amp;quot;highlights&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;highlight&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;page&amp;quot;, 
                      &amp;quot;location&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;yellow&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pink&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;orange&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;,
                      &amp;quot;export&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;truncated&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;kindle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;note&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;limits&amp;quot;))

df_com &amp;lt;- str_c(df$word, &amp;quot; &amp;quot;) 
df_com &amp;lt;- data.frame(df_com)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs split the text into bigrams and count the most common two word pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;df_bigram &amp;lt;- df_com %&amp;gt;% 
 unnest_tokens(bigram, df_com, token = &amp;quot;ngrams&amp;quot;, 
 n = 3, n_min = 2)
top_bigrams &amp;lt;- df_bigram %&amp;gt;% 
 group_by(bigram) %&amp;gt;% 
 count() %&amp;gt;% 
 arrange(desc(n))%&amp;gt;% 
 print(n=20)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 107,317 x 2

&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# And visualize them on a plot

top &amp;lt;- top_bigrams[1:25,]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;top %&amp;gt;% ungroup() %&amp;gt;% mutate(bigram = fct_reorder(bigram, n)) %&amp;gt;% 
 ggplot(aes(x=bigram, y=n)) + 
 geom_col() + 
 coord_flip() +
 theme_classic() + 
 theme(legend.position = &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;,
 text = element_text(size=18))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-12-13-an-accidental-side-effect-of-text-mining_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you go back above in the top 10 most frequent words table 6th word was change. But we didn‚Äôt know what the change was about. And here we see that one of the most common bigram is behavioral change. It is making more sense. But it can improve to look at each book individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also do what we did for the whole document for highlights from single books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how can we capture them individually?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs first look at the text once more.&lt;img src=&#34;/img/kindleclip.png&#34; /&gt;Before each book &lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúYour Kindle Notes For:‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt; appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs find out the line numbers for the beginning and the end of each book and use those indexes for fishing out each book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will reuse the data frame df we created above. &lt;strong&gt;str_which()&lt;/strong&gt; function returns index numbers of the lines which contain a given pattern. In the last step, capturing the text between two consecutive indexes will give us the book between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Since I modified df above. I will recreate it again.
df &amp;lt;- data.frame(highlights)
df$highlights &amp;lt;- str_replace_all(df$highlights, &amp;quot;‚Äô&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;#39;&amp;quot;)

# Getting the index number for each book

indexes &amp;lt;- str_which(df$highlights, pattern = fixed(&amp;quot;Your Kindle Notes For&amp;quot;))
book_names &amp;lt;- df$highlights[indexes + 1]
indexes &amp;lt;-  c(indexes,nrow(df))

# Create an empty list 

books &amp;lt;- list()

# Now the trick. Capture each 28 book separately in a list. 

for(i in 1:(length(indexes)-1)) {
    books[[i]] &amp;lt;- data.frame(df$highlights[(indexes[i]:indexes[i+1]-1)])
    colnames(books[[i]]) &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;word_column&amp;quot;
    books[[i]]$word_column &amp;lt;- as.character(books[[i]]$word_column)
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs check whether it worked, for example you can look up the 5th book on our list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(books[[5]])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##                                           word_column

&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(books[[15]])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##                                                  word_column

&lt;p&gt;Now, we have the individual books captured. I will repeat the procedure we used to analyse the whole text above to analyze each of the 28 books by using a for loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;top &amp;lt;- list()
for(i in 1:28){
books[[i]] &amp;lt;- books[[i]] %&amp;gt;% unnest_tokens(word, word_column) %&amp;gt;%
             anti_join(stop_words) %&amp;gt;% 
             filter(!word %in% c(&amp;quot;highlights&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;highlight&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;page&amp;quot;,

# Find out the top words in each book and capture them in a list (top)

top[[i]] &amp;lt;- books[[i]] %&amp;gt;% 
              group_by(word) %&amp;gt;% 
              count() %&amp;gt;% 
              arrange(desc(n))
}
for(i in 1:28){
  print(book_names[[i]])
  print(top[[i]])

&lt;p&gt;If you want to see another example of this capturing process you can have a look at my recent post &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataatomic.com/r/data-wrangling-text-mining/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at each book individually, he started to be more and more obsessed about the books in my kindle. He decided to order a couple of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sentiment analysis&lt;/strong&gt; is used to evaluate emotional charge in a text mining project. Most common uses are social media monitoring, customer experience management, and Voice of Customer, to understand how they feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;bing&lt;/strong&gt; lexicon categorizes words into positive and negative categories, in a binary fashion. The &lt;strong&gt;nrc&lt;/strong&gt; lexicon uses categories of positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using bing lexicon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives us the top words contributed to each emotional category. Some examples to note are success, effective, for positive and bad, hard and limits.&lt;img src=&#34;/img/sentiment1.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how R produced the above plot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;df &amp;lt;- data.frame(highlights)
df$highlights &amp;lt;- str_replace_all(df$highlights, &amp;quot;‚Äô&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;#39;&amp;quot;)
df &amp;lt;- df %&amp;gt;% unnest_tokens(word, highlights) %&amp;gt;% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %&amp;gt;% 
 filter(!word %in% c(&amp;quot;highlights&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;highlight&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;page&amp;quot;, 
                      &amp;quot;location&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;yellow&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pink&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;orange&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;,
                      &amp;quot;export&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;truncated&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;kindle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;note&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;limits&amp;quot;))

bing_word_counts &amp;lt;- df %&amp;gt;% inner_join(get_sentiments(&amp;quot;bing&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;% 
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %&amp;gt;%
  ungroup()

bing_word_counts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  group_by(sentiment) %&amp;gt;%

  ggplot(aes(reorder(word, n), n, fill=sentiment)) + 
  geom_bar(alpha=0.8, stat=&amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;, show.legend = FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = &amp;quot;free_y&amp;quot;) +
  labs(y= &amp;quot;Contribution to sentiment&amp;quot;, x = NULL) +
  coord_flip()
bing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-12-13-an-accidental-side-effect-of-text-mining_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using nrc lexion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that I am more likely to highlight if a text is charged with positive rather than negative sentiment, and individually trust, anticipation and joy rather than fear and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;df &amp;lt;- data.frame(highlights)
df$highlights &amp;lt;- str_replace_all(df$highlights, &amp;quot;‚Äô&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;#39;&amp;quot;)

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Joining, by = &amp;quot;word&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sentiment &amp;lt;- df %&amp;gt;%
        left_join(get_sentiments(&amp;quot;nrc&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
        filter(!is.na(sentiment)) %&amp;gt;%
        count(sentiment, sort = TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Joining, by = &amp;quot;word&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sentiment&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 10 x 2

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normalized sentiments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important thing to add, since each emotion category has different number of words in a language. Emotional categories with less words are less likely to appear in a given text. Thus, I would like to normalize them according to their numbers in the lexicon and see how it differs than the above results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# I will add numbers of each categories from the NRC lexicon

lexicon &amp;lt;- c(2317, 3338, 1234, 842, 1483, 691, 1250, 1195, 1060, 535)
polarity &amp;lt;-  c(1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0)
sentiment &amp;lt;- data.frame(sentiment, lexicon)
norm_sentiment &amp;lt;- sentiment %&amp;gt;% mutate( normalized = n/lexicon) %&amp;gt;% arrange(desc(normalized))
sentiment &amp;lt;- data.frame(norm_sentiment, polarity)
sentiment&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##       sentiment    n lexicon normalized polarity

&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# General findings

## 2        1  5619&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;strong&gt;anticipation&lt;/strong&gt; is the highest emotion found in the text that I highlighted. This does not seem a coincidence to me. Since most of the books in our analysis is about productivity and self-development. The productivity tips and tools usually contain words associated with anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, I can look at the sentiment for individual books&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;df &amp;lt;- data.frame(highlights)

# Kindle uses apostrophes (‚Äô), but stop_words uses sigle quotes (&amp;#39;) 
# To be able to use all stop_words I should replace apostrophes with quotes
df$highlights &amp;lt;- str_replace_all(df$highlights, &amp;quot;‚Äô&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;#39;&amp;quot;)

# Getting the index number for each book

indexes &amp;lt;- str_which(df$highlights, pattern = fixed(&amp;quot;Your Kindle Notes For&amp;quot;))
book_names &amp;lt;- df$highlights[indexes + 1]
indexes &amp;lt;-  c(indexes,nrow(df))

# Capturing each book individually

books &amp;lt;- list()
for (i in 1:(length(indexes)-1)) {
    books[[i]] &amp;lt;- data.frame(df$highlights[(indexes[i]:indexes[i+1]-1)])
    colnames(books[[i]]) &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;word_column&amp;quot;
    books[[i]]$word_column &amp;lt;- as.character(books[[i]]$word_column)
}

# Next step in the plan was splitting the text into single words by unnest_tokens function.


for(i in 1:28){
books[[i]] &amp;lt;- books[[i]] %&amp;gt;% unnest_tokens(word, word_column) %&amp;gt;%
             anti_join(stop_words) %&amp;gt;% 
             filter(!word %in% c(&amp;quot;highlights&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;highlight&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;page&amp;quot;, 
                      &amp;quot;location&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;yellow&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pink&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;orange&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;))
}

sentiment &amp;lt;- list()
for (i in 1:28){
sentiment[[i]] &amp;lt;- books[[i]] %&amp;gt;%
        left_join(get_sentiments(&amp;quot;nrc&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%

        count(sentiment, sort = TRUE)

&lt;p&gt;The lowest positivity score was found in the book &lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúMan‚Äôs search for meaning‚Äù.&lt;/strong&gt; This is also kind of expected. Since the book is based on Victor Frankl sufferings during the second world war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am getting more and more convinced text mining is giving good insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book ‚ÄúThe Outliers‚Äù appeared on the top of the positivity plot was a real outlier here. üòÆ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs look at the word count in our Outlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;book_names[[27]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;Outliers: The Story of Success&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;top[[27]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 105 x 2
## # Groups:   word [105]
##    word             n

## 10 sternberg        2
## # ... with 95 more rows&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word count from the book ‚ÄúThe Outliers‚Äù below is 107. This is really low. So in the next iteration, I would remove it from the analysis since it will not be very informative. It is hard to know everything from the beginning and we will go back and make some additional cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;summary&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not feasible to read millions of pages to check whether text mining is reliable. But here I got some data that I know the content and I applied text mining approaches and sentiment analysis.
Both the monograms or bigrams pointed to similar ideas what the books were about. And the sentiments made sense with the genres of the books in my kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs come back to our hacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was affected by an unanticipated side effect of the text analyses. As he continued the project, the insights from the frequent ngrams made him more and more interested in the content. He started reading again and the more he read the more world look differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was transformed into a better version of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world was brighter. ‚òÄÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radio disrupted the silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúbrrring‚Ä¶..brrring‚Ä¶..brrring‚Ä¶..‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Have more things happen at once: Parallel Programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parallel processing is about &lt;strong&gt;using multiple cores of your computer‚Äôs CPU&lt;/strong&gt; to run multiple tasks simultaneously. This enables you to complete &lt;strong&gt;the same task multiple times quicker!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/veri-ivanova-unsplash.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo by Veri Ivanova on Unsplash&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In R, usually computations run sequentially. When we initiate multiple tasks they are performed one after the other, new task starts only after the previous one is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might become the bottleneck when you come across a computationally heavy process. Such as running monte carlo simulations or fitting multiple machine learning models.&lt;strong&gt;Typically, if I have a process which runs longer than 3 minutes, I consider using parallel processing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might sound complicated but parallel computing is simple. When you have a repetitive task which takes too much of your valuable time why not implement it and &lt;strong&gt;save time?&lt;/strong&gt; Even if you have a single task, you can benefit from parallel processing by &lt;strong&gt;dividing the task into smaller pieces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two widely used packages for parallel processing are &lt;a href=&#34;https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/doc/parallel.pdf&#34;&gt;parallel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;foreach%20cran%20page&#34;&gt;foreach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs do some parallel processing..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-is-our-goal&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is our goal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently analyzed data from horror movies released in the world between 2012 and 2017. What caught my attention was that movies are more likely to be released at the 13th of each month. You can visit my recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataatomic.com/r/probability-distributions/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; if you want to know more about this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;lets-get-the-data&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let‚Äôs get the data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2782 movies released in one of the 30 days (categories). The resulting table below shows the days of the month and how many movies released at that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse) # ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, 
                   # purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will simulate 1 million multinomial trials of distributing 2782 movies to 30 days of the month. This type of distributions (k &amp;gt; 2) are called &lt;strong&gt;multinomial distributions.&lt;/strong&gt;xx`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a function to find p values for each day. But it takes sometime to run. I will try to improve the runtime by &lt;strong&gt;optimizing my code&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;using parallel processing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;multfun &amp;lt;- function(x){ 
  a &amp;lt;- list()
  avc &amp;lt;- rmultinom(1000000, size=2782, prob=rep(1/30, 30))  # Create probability matrix
  for (i in 1:30){ a[[i]] &amp;lt;- mean(avc[i,1:1000000] &amp;gt;=x) }   # Find probabilities for each day
  ifelse(do.call(sum,a)/30 &amp;lt;= 0.5, p_val &amp;lt;-  2 * do.call(sum,a)/30, 
                                   p_val &amp;lt;- 2*(1 - do.call(sum,a)/30))
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;multfun() uses rmultinom() function to produce a matrix of monte carlo simulations of 1.000.000 random multinomial distributions with 30 categories. Then calculates total probabilities of any given observation or rarer events at each day from this matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This actually translates into the p value for a given (n) observation.
For example, when I run multfun(124), It will give me the p value for observing a day with at least 124 movie releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Run an example
multfun(124)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.001844267&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To calculate the p values for the top 5 days with highest number of movie releases, I can run multfun() multiple times for each value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;execute-the-multfun-function-multiple-times&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Execute the multfun() function multiple times&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;system.time({
multfun(124)
multfun(119)
multfun(110)
multfun(107)
multfun(102)
})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##    user  system elapsed 
##   15.72    0.21   15.94&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For few values it can be ok, but easier methods exist if you need to run your function repetitvely for a bigger number of inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;using-lapply-function&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Using lapply() function&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of running a function for different input values several times, you can use lapply() function. &lt;strong&gt;It loops over a given vector or list input (l in lapply comes from list), and applies the input function to each element in that list.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;system.time({
lapply(c(124,119,119,197,102), multfun)
})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##    user  system elapsed 
##   15.64    0.29   15.92&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;using-parallel-package-functions-parlapply&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using parallel package functions: parLapply()&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have ever used any of lapply() or sapply function you are halfway in parallel processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;preparation-for-parallel-processing&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Preparation for parallel processing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;strong&gt;detectCores()&lt;/strong&gt; function to find out how many cores are available in your CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to create the clusters required apply &lt;strong&gt;makeCluster()&lt;/strong&gt; with the number of cores you intend to use. In my computer, I have 6 cores and I will assign 5 cores as the multiple workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;parallel-processing-parlapply&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Parallel processing: parLapply&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;parLapply is the easiest way to parallelise computation. You first need to replace lapply with parLapply and enter an extra cluster argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, an additional preparation step to create the clusters required. &lt;strong&gt;makeCluster()&lt;/strong&gt; function creates the number of cluster that you intend to use. In my computer, I have 6 cores and I will assign 5 cores as the multiple workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(parallel)
system.time({
n_cores &amp;lt;- detectCores(logical=FALSE)
cl &amp;lt;- makeCluster(n_cores-1)
parLapply(cl , c(124,119,119,197,102), multfun)
})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##    user  system elapsed 
##    0.02    0.01    4.54&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;stopCluster(cl)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When done, include stopCluster() argument to avoid running R sessions in different clusters in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, I can expect 5X quicker processing with 5 cores. But there are overhead costs. Additional preparation steps such as makecluster() function also takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had much quicker execution by parallel processing. Is there a room for further improvement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs look at our multfun function again‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;multfun &amp;lt;- function(x){ 
  a &amp;lt;- list()
  avc &amp;lt;- rmultinom(1000000, size=2782, prob=rep(1/30, 30))  # Create probability matrix
  for (i in 1:30){ a[[i]] &amp;lt;- mean(avc[i,1:1000000] &amp;gt;=x) }   # Find probabilities for each day
  ifelse(do.call(sum,a)/30 &amp;lt;= 0.5, p_val &amp;lt;-  2 * do.call(sum,a)/30, 
                                   p_val &amp;lt;- 2*(1 - do.call(sum,a)/30))
                       }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In R, it is possible to do things in multiple ways. Sometimes we need more readable version and sometimes just fast code. I see that multfun uses a list and a for loop. If I find a way without using them I can get a faster run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;improved-multfun-define-the-function-without-using-a-loop-and-list&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improved multfun: Define the function without using a loop and list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mean function in R can be vectorized instead of looping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can achieve the same result what the first multfun() was doing by including what for loop was doing inside the ‚Äú[ ]‚Äù. Mean function will be applied find the total proportion of values equal or bigger than &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;multfun_opt &amp;lt;- function(x){ 
  avc &amp;lt;- rmultinom(1000000, size=2782, rep(1/30, 30))
  p &amp;lt;- mean(avc[1:30, 1:1000000] &amp;gt;=x)
  ifelse(p &amp;lt;= 0.5, p_val &amp;lt;-  2 * p, p_val &amp;lt;- 2*(1 - p))}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs check whether improved multfun is faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;system.time({
n_cores &amp;lt;- detectCores(logical=FALSE)
cl &amp;lt;- makeCluster(n_cores-1)
parLapply(cl , c(124,119,119,197,102), multfun_opt)
})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##    user  system elapsed 
##    0.00    0.06    4.32&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;stopCluster(cl)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since rmultinom is the bottleneck here, we did not see very big improvement in overall function. We got 10-20% improvement. But it is good to know, what we can improve when we really need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs compare only the part of the function which uses the vectorized operation and the one with for loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;avc &amp;lt;- rmultinom(1000000, size=2782, prob=rep(1/30, 30)) 
a &amp;lt;- list()

system.time({
  for (i in 1:30){ a[[i]] &amp;lt;- mean(avc[i,1:1000000] &amp;gt;=124) }  
  ifelse(do.call(sum,a)/30 &amp;lt;= 0.5, p_val &amp;lt;-  2 * do.call(sum,a)/30, 
                                   p_val &amp;lt;- 2*(1 - do.call(sum,a)/30)) })&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##    user  system elapsed 
##    0.41    0.01    0.42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;system.time({
    p &amp;lt;- mean(avc[1:30, 1:1000000] &amp;gt;=124)
  ifelse(p &amp;lt;= 0.5, p_val &amp;lt;-  2 * p, p_val &amp;lt;- 2*(1 - p)) })&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##    user  system elapsed 
##    0.22    0.02    0.24&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vectorised version is twice faster!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;further-improvement&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Further Improvement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use Rprof() function to profile your process, it will return how much time each subprocess takes time.
Let‚Äôs profile our function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;multfun_opt &amp;lt;- function(x){ 
  avc &amp;lt;- rmultinom(1000000, size=2782, rep(1/30, 30))
  p &amp;lt;- mean(avc[1:30, 1:1000000] &amp;gt;=x)
  ifelse(p &amp;lt;= 0.5, p_val &amp;lt;-  2 * p, p_val &amp;lt;- 2*(1 - p))
  }

Rprof()
multfun_opt(124)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.0018542&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Rprof(NULL)

summaryRprof()$by.self&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##                self.time self.pct total.time total.pct
## &amp;quot;rmultinom&amp;quot;         1.80    93.75       1.80     93.75
## &amp;quot;&amp;gt;=&amp;quot;                0.08     4.17       0.08      4.17
## &amp;quot;mean&amp;quot;              0.02     1.04       0.12      6.25
## &amp;quot;mean.default&amp;quot;      0.02     1.04       0.02      1.04&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In profile summary, &lt;strong&gt;total.pct&lt;/strong&gt; shows the total percentage of the duration of each task inside the function. We can see that &lt;strong&gt;rmultinom()&lt;/strong&gt; part of takes more than 90% of the processing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are looking further improvement we can focus on it. To improve rmultinom() part, I will isolate it by splitting the multfun into two functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    In general, to be able to apply parallel processing we need to be able to dispatch our tasks as functions, with one task going to each processor. We can apply parLapply to execute multiple functions at the same time.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above, first improvement was using parLapply instead of lapply and second replacing a loop with a faster vectorized operation. Now, we will utilize another approach, dividing a task into smaller pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to create a new rmultinom() function, which I call fastbinom. To keep things simple, it will take only one argument which I will use &lt;strong&gt;to divide 1.000.000 rmultinom simulations into 5 equal parts of 200.000 rmultinom simulations.&lt;/strong&gt; Each will be handled by a different core in my CPU boosting my speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fastbinom &amp;lt;- function(x) {
  rmultinom(x, size=2782, rep(1/30,30)) 
}

multfun_fin &amp;lt;- function(x){ 
  p &amp;lt;- mean(avc[1:30, 1:1000000] &amp;gt;=x)
  ifelse(p &amp;lt;= 0.5, p_val &amp;lt;-  2 * p, p_val &amp;lt;- 2*(1 - p))
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here comes an additional overhead. Since, multfun_fin will be executed on different cores, we need to export the data to each cluster. Windows rely on &lt;strong&gt;clusterExport()&lt;/strong&gt; for data to be copied to each cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test the final optimized code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Final optimized code 
system.time({
cl &amp;lt;- makeCluster(5)
avc &amp;lt;- parLapply(cl , c(200000, 200000, 200000, 200000, 200000), fastbinom)
avc &amp;lt;- do.call(cbind, avc)
clusterExport(cl, varlist=&amp;quot;avc&amp;quot;, envir=environment())
parLapply(cl, c(124,119,119,197,102), multfun_fin)
})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##    user  system elapsed 
##    0.60    0.61    3.05&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;stopCluster(cl)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a bit improvement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;final-test&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Final test&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs now put things together, I will test different versions I created so far. But this time for more input values, I will use my function for each of the 30 categories and by using up to 1.000.000 simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs call the initial version: &lt;code&gt;original&lt;/code&gt;, second &lt;code&gt;parLapply&lt;/code&gt;, third &lt;code&gt;parLapply, optimized&lt;/code&gt; and the last &lt;code&gt;parLapply/fastbinom&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parallel processing is easy and can get your tasks extremely faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where are we standing on fight against cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five-year survival rates is a good indicator of improvement in cancer medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am using the article by Jemal et. al.¬†published on the Journal of the National Cancer institute. You can find the original publication here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/109/9/djx030/3092246&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/109/9/djx030/3092246&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final take home messages in this article were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancer death rates continue to decrease in the United States&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;progress&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;very limited in some cancers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is needed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New strategies for prevention, early detection and treatment is crucial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors made an extensive study to investigate changes in five year cancer survival rates between the years 1975-77 to 2006-12. I want to create data visualizations to have an overview on the progress we made so far and also compare different types of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access the data on my Github repository at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/korur/healthcareinformatics&#34;&gt;https://github.com/korur/healthcareinformatics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will use lolipop charts to plot the change in the survival rates. We need some data preparation first. You can see the &lt;code&gt;NAs&lt;/code&gt; in the first row. These actually contain the confidence intervals for the survival rates. Since I will not use them I can use &lt;code&gt;na.omit()&lt;/code&gt; function to remove them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also change column names and some long cancer types for easier typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most often I prefer data in tidy format which is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each observation has its own row.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each variable has its own column.&lt;br /&gt;
For an &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataatomic.com/r/predict-diseases/&#34;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; post where I tidied my data with gather() function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my data although two variables Y1977 and Y2012 are in two separate columns instead of one, I leave it as it is since it is better this way for lolipop charts and similar line charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fct_reorder()&lt;/strong&gt; function from &lt;strong&gt;forcats&lt;/strong&gt; package is great for ordering factor variables according to a numeric vector. This comes with the &lt;strong&gt;tidyverse&lt;/strong&gt; package we installed in the beginning. I will order my graph so that cancers with highest survival will be at the top of the graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating visuals to have a good overview of data helps to understand it better and helps us to think about future directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some type of cancers such as lung and pancreas survival rates remained very low.
How can we make it better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I came across a data that I thought it is a great opportunity to write about Binomial probability distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-is-a-binomial-distribution-and-why-we-need-to-know-it&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is a binomial distribution and why we need to know it?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Binomial distributions&lt;/strong&gt; are formed when we repeat a set of events and each single event in a set has two possible outcomes. Bi- in binomial distributions refers to those outcomes. Two possibilities are usually described as &lt;strong&gt;Success&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;no Success&lt;/strong&gt;. A ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in flipping coins, the two possibilities are getting a head (success) or tails (no success) or vice versa. And one set can be, e.g.¬†10 or 50 times coin flipping. We can repeat this set as many times as we like and record how many times we got heads (success) in each repetition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;why-is-this-interesting&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is this interesting?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the probability of getting 25 heads out of 50 coin flips? This is not very unusual. &lt;strong&gt;But how about getting 49 heads out of 50 flips? Is this really possible?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs figure it out. We can repeat this set of 50 times coin flipping 100.000 times and record the results of each set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, we can simulate this in R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can simulate a given number of repeated (here 100.000) sets (50 times of coin flipping) of experiments with &lt;strong&gt;rbinom()&lt;/strong&gt; function. It takes 3 arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rbinom(&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
n = number of repetitions = 100.000,&lt;br /&gt;
size = sample size = 50,&lt;br /&gt;
p = the probability of success (chance of throwing heads is 0.5)&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs compare the probabilities of getting more than 25, 35 or even 49 heads. You can combine rbinom with mean function to find the percentage of the events with a chosen outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Probability of getting 25 or more heads
mean(rbinom(100000, 50, .5) &amp;gt;= 25)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.55649&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Probability of getting 35 or more heads
mean(rbinom(100000, 50, .5) &amp;gt;= 35)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.00301&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Probability of getting 49 or more heads
mean(rbinom(100000, 50, .5) &amp;gt;= 49)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found the probability of throwing 49 or more heads to be 0. But to be technically precise it is one in 375 trillion times
(= &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(1/((1/(2^{49}) + (1/2^{50})))\)&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs visualize our simulation. The bars in red represents the sets which had 35 or more heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse) # ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, 
                   # purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats
library(viridis)

heads &amp;lt;- rbinom(100000, 50, 0.5)
heads &amp;lt;- data.frame(heads)
heads &amp;lt;- heads %&amp;gt;% mutate(events = ifelse(heads &amp;gt; 35, &amp;quot;&amp;gt; 35&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;lt; 35&amp;quot;))
heads %&amp;gt;%  ggplot(aes(x=heads, fill = events)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(&amp;quot;black&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;)) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18),
        legend.position = c(0.85, 0.85)) +
  labs(x = &amp;quot;Number of heads in 50 coin flips&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-10-28-an-intuitive-example-for-a-binomial-distribution_files/figure-html/install%20packages-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even to get 35 or more heads has very low probability. Most of the events will be an integer between 15 and 35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binomial probability distributions help us to understand the likelihood of such rare events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see here a key difference of a binomial distribution with normal distribution is that they can take only discrete values. It is not possible to have 35.5 heads. Although, there are differences, &lt;strong&gt;when the sample size is large enough their shape will be similar and normal distributions can be used to estimate binomial probabilities&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what are all those will be useful for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coin flipping expertise may have limited real life applications but let‚Äôs give some other examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Binomial distributions in machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You built a machine learning model with a binary outcome. Let‚Äôs say pathological image recognition algorithm for liver cancer that works with 90% accuracy. You tested 100 patients and you want to know your 95% confidence interval? Or your new results showed that your model detected less than 70 patients correctly. Is it possible? Or you should start optimizing your parameters again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of patients responding to a treatment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs say you have a new therapy for cancer which has 10% probability to cure a patient. You have 500 patients which took the drug. The expected number of recovering patients is 50. But you found that 75 patients responded. Is that due to chance or a significant effect? Or you should start looking underlying factors if there is something about the therapy or the patient group?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think about a hospital emergency station.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a hospital manager and you want to organize the staff numbers correctly for different weekdays. You know total number of patients came in to a emergency station because of alcohol poisoning in a given time period. You can analyse the distribution of patient numbers for each day of the week. Most likely you will have more such cases in the weekend and you need larger staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be also true for other businesses. They can use binomial distributions to calculate changes in demand and plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are running a webserver.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can allocate your resources better by identifying times when traffic will be higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other questions in which binomial distributions will come in handy are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of people who answered ‚Äòyes‚Äô to a survey question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many games a team will win in one season?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vote counts for a candidate in an election.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of defective products in a production run.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binomial distributions are common and they have many applications of real life situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs use some real life data to apply our knowledge so far. The data comes from TidyTuesday which I introduced in my last &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataatomic.com/r/tidytuesday-which-are-the-best-family-cars/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It contains information about Horror Movies released since 2012. And the question I asked was whether horror movies are more likely be released at the 13th each month?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being in &lt;strong&gt;the right mindset&lt;/strong&gt; for anything gives us a better feeling of it. &lt;strong&gt;If you go to the cinema at the 13th to watch a horror movie, do you like it more than other days?&lt;/strong&gt; We don‚Äôt know if this is true but movie makers might be counting on that. I analyzed Horror movies data and calculated number of releases in different days of the month. &lt;strong&gt;This is a good example of a binomial probability distribution.&lt;/strong&gt; Let‚Äôs look at the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;horror_movies &amp;lt;- readr::read_csv(&amp;quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-10-22/horror_movies.csv&amp;quot;)

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;is-this-significant&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Is this significant?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the data, there were &lt;strong&gt;2782&lt;/strong&gt; movies associated with a release date. So expected movie release per day is &lt;strong&gt;92&lt;/strong&gt; (2782 / 30).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, we see above that some days are much higher than that. What we want to know is, which days are in the &lt;strong&gt;range of random chance&lt;/strong&gt; and which days there is a &lt;strong&gt;significant preference or an aversion&lt;/strong&gt; to release a movie. So that we can conclude our insight about movie makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Size of our distribution is the total number of movies released 
n_value &amp;lt;- horror_date_table %&amp;gt;% ungroup() %&amp;gt;% summarize(n2 = sum(n))
size &amp;lt;- n_value$n2
size&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 2782&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# The probability (= success rate = a given outcome to occur = movie released)
p &amp;lt;-  1/30  # Since it can occur any of the 30 days in a months&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can simulate this 2782 movie release dates events 100.000 times with rbinom function and calculate the mean and variance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Simulated statistics
 
estimates &amp;lt;-  rbinom(100000, 2782, 1/30)

# Simulated mean
mean(estimates)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 92.7603&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Simulated variance
var(estimates)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 89.4458&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average value is around 92 movies released in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also calculate theoretical values by the derived mathematical formulas that define the binomial function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mean = size * p&lt;br /&gt;
Variance = size * p * (1 - p)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs calculate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Theoretical statistics

# Expected mean = size * p
mean_theoretical &amp;lt;- 2782 * 1/30
mean_theoretical&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 92.73333&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Expected Variance = size * p * (1-p)
var_theoretical &amp;lt;- size * 1/30 * (1-1/30)
var_theoretical&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 89.64222&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, simulated and theoretical values are almost the same. So, I can use my simulations to find out 95% confidence interval which will contain the values that can happen due to random chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will define an interval that contains 95% of probabilities in our simulated distributions. And the values outside will be the ones which were not due to random chance. To do this I need 2.5th and 97.5th quantiles of the distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do this by the qbinom() function in r. For example qbinom(0.975, size, p) will return the value which will define the cut off which contains 0.975 of the probabilities. And our confidence interval will be the interval between:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;qbinom(0.025, size, p) &amp;lt; Confidence Interval &amp;lt; qbinom(0.975, size, p)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Boundaries for p values smaller than 0.05

lower &amp;lt;- qbinom(0.975, 2782, 1/30)
lower&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 112&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;upper &amp;lt;- qbinom(0.025, 2782, 1/30)
upper&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 75&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;movies &amp;lt;- rbinom(100000, 2782, 1/30)
movies &amp;lt;- data.frame(movies)

&lt;p&gt;95% of the time, days in one month will have between 75 and 112 movie releases. Higher or lower values than this range can not happen due to random chance according to our binomial distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-to-calculate-the-p-value-for-a-binomial-test-using-pbinom&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to calculate the p-value for a binomial test using pbinom?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our observed value for the 13th is 124. Above the 97.5th quantile. So it is significant. But what is the exact p value? Let‚Äôs define p value first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    P value is the sum of the probability of that event plus the sum of the probabilities of similar events that are equally likely or less likely.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example in coin flipping, probability of heads is (0.5). If we follow our definition, p value is the sum of the probability of that event (0.5) and similar events which is equally or less likely i.e.¬†tails (0.5). This makes our p value 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in our horror movie data this will be the sum of the probabilities of getting 124 movie releases or events that are equally probable or rarer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In R, &lt;strong&gt;pbinom&lt;/strong&gt; function defines the cumulative probabilities. For example, pbinom(124, 2782, 1/30) will give us the cumulative probabilities of any number of movie releases up to 124. By using 1-pbinom(124, 2782, 1/30) we can find the sum of the probabilities with equal or lower chance than having 124.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, p value for getting at least 124 movie release is;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Probability of getting at least 124 movie releases (e.g. the 13th)

p_val_binom &amp;lt;- 2 * (1 - pbinom(124, 2782, 1/30))
p_val_binom&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.001335455&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We multiplied by two because same rare events can happen in the left side of our confidence interval as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs put those p values on our barplot to highlight the significant days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# I will add a new column so I can separately define values outside the 95% confidence interval.

horror_date_table &amp;lt;- horror_date_table %&amp;gt;% 
                     mutate(p_val = 2 * (1 - pbinom(n, 2782, 1/30, 
                            lower.tail = ifelse(n&amp;gt;93, TRUE, FALSE)))) %&amp;gt;% 
                     mutate(p_val = cut(p_val, breaks = c(-Inf, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, Inf), 
                                        labels = c(&amp;quot;&amp;lt; 0.001&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;&amp;lt; 0.01&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;lt; 0.05&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;NS&amp;quot;)))

    ggplot(aes(x=day, y=n)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill=p_val)) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = viridis(4))  +

        axis.ticks= element_blank(), 
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, vjust = 10)) +
    labs(
        caption= &amp;quot;&amp;quot;,

&lt;p&gt;We performed a hypothesis testing by calculating the p value by using the pbinom() function and found couple of other days where movies are more or less likely to be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, another widely used way to do so is to calculate the mean (the expected probability) of our distribution and its standard deviation and to verify how many standard deviations the observed value is away from the mean (the z score).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;calculating-the-p-value-by-normal-approximation&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Calculating the p-value by normal approximation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the sample size is large, binomial distributions can be approximated by a normal distribution. To build the normal distribution, I need mean and standard deviation. I can calculate this from the horror movie data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sample_mean &amp;lt;- horror_date_table %&amp;gt;% ungroup() %&amp;gt;% summarise(n=mean(n))
sample_mean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 1 x 1
##       n
##   &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
## 1  92.7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p &amp;lt;- 1/30

sample_variance &amp;lt;-  2782 * p * (1-p)
sample_variance&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 89.64222&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sample_sd &amp;lt;- sqrt(sample_variance)
sample_sd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 9.467958&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can calculate the z-score for our observation of 124 movies that are released on the 13th. &lt;strong&gt;Simply, z-score is: how many standard deviations an observation is away from the mean.&lt;/strong&gt; Since 95% of the observations will fall within 1.96 standard deviations from the mean in a normal distribution, a higher z-score will show that our p value is indeed significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Calculate z-score for observation 13th of the month = 124 movies are 
# released
observation &amp;lt;- 124
z_score &amp;lt;- (observation - sample_mean) / sample_sd
z_score&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##          n
## 1 3.302367&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can calculate the exact p value by using a normal distribution function pnorm() and the z score we found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Calculate the p-value of observing 124 or more movie releases in a day

p_val_nor &amp;lt;- 2 * pnorm(3.302, lower.tail = FALSE)
p_val_nor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.0009599807&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, I found similar values (Normal: &lt;strong&gt;0.00095&lt;/strong&gt;, Binomial: &lt;strong&gt;0.00133&lt;/strong&gt;) by using an approximation of a normal distribution and by using binomial distributions. Both methods proves that Horror movies are more likely to be released at the 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;future-thoughts-conclusions&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Future thoughts / Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many events in real life can be explained by binomial probability distributions, and they allow us to calculate whether or not the events happened due to random chance and test our hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be a fun data analysis such as in horror movies, or more serious subjects like testing of new medicines or predicting accuracy of machine learning algorithms detecting diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serdar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I will analyze Car Fuel Economy &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-15&#34;&gt;dataset&lt;/a&gt; from TidyTuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-is-tidytuesday&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is TidyTuesday?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project in R organized by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://thomasmock.netlify.com/post/tidytuesday-a-weekly-social-data-project-in-r/&#34;&gt;R for Data Science community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a great way of improving your Data wrangling and visualization techniques, &lt;strong&gt;sharing and learning from others&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find more information on their &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuel economy &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml&#34;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; are the result of the work done by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Full data dictionary can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/index.shtml#fuelType1&#34;&gt;fueleconomy.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data contains 83 parameters of more than 40.000 Vehicles. That‚Äôs a lot of information!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;going-for-your-next-family-camping-adventure-first-check-your-car-model.&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Going for your next family camping adventure? First, check your car model.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better Fuel economy and recent developments on longer running electric car batteries are great. But one thing which does not change in families‚Äô lives is the &lt;strong&gt;need for space&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don‚Äôt want crying kids running around because of &lt;strong&gt;a missing teddy bear&lt;/strong&gt; which did not fit in the baggage. Check, which brands will serve you best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially, if you have a daughter who likes to travel with a lot of toys.&lt;img src=&#34;/img/raisa.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;raisa.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let‚Äôs figure out a solution for peaceful weekend trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;which-brand-produce-most-family-friendly-cars-in-terms-of-baggage-volume.&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 41804    83&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will subset my data for easier computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs keep the following columns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;year - model year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make - manufacturer (division)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;model - model name (carline)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VClass - EPA vehicle size class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hlv - hatchback luggage volume (cubic feet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hpv - hatchback passenger volume (cubic feet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;displ - engine displacement in liters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lv4 - 4 door luggage volume (cubic feet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pv4 - 4-door passenger volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;big_sub &amp;lt;- big_epa_cars %&amp;gt;% 
  select(fuelType, year, make, model, VClass, hlv, hpv,lv4,pv4,displ)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will start exploring the data. For the moment, first I will focus on &lt;strong&gt;Midsize cars&lt;/strong&gt; (VClass).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will filter for the main pool of Midsize cars with 4 door and luggage volume of bigger than 6 and passenger volume larger than 75.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;posn.j &amp;lt;- position_jitter(width=0.2)
big_sw &amp;lt;- big_sub %&amp;gt;% 
  filter(VClass == &amp;quot;Midsize Cars&amp;quot; &amp;amp; pv4 &amp;gt; 75 &amp;amp; lv4 &amp;gt; 6) 

big_sw %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=pv4, y=lv4)) + 
  geom_point(shape=21,
             alpha=0.4,size =3, 
             position = posn.j) + 
  theme(plot.caption=element_text(size=11), 
        text = element_text(size=18),
        plot.title = element_text(size=32), 
        legend.position = &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;) +
  geom_smooth(method = &amp;quot;lm&amp;quot;, color =&amp;quot;red&amp;quot;) + 
  coord_fixed() +
    labs(x = &amp;quot;Passenger Vol (Cubic feet)&amp;quot;, 
         y = &amp;quot;Luggage Vol (Cubic feet)&amp;quot;, 
         title = 
    &amp;quot;Luggage space negatively \ncorrelates with passenger space&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-10-23-tidytuesday-which-are-the-best-family-cars_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1152&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not unexpected. But good to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insight 1: Negative correlation suggests that producers sacrifice passenger space to produce bigger room for the luggage or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I will look at the luggage volume in Mid sized cars and I will order them according to highest average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pp &amp;lt;- big_sw %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(make = fct_reorder(make, lv4)) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=make, y=lv4, col=make)) + 
  geom_boxplot(varwidth=TRUE) +
  theme(plot.caption=element_text(size=11), 
        text = element_text(size=18),    
        plot.title = element_text(size=32), 
        legend.position = &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;) +
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(x = element_blank(), 
       y = &amp;quot;Luggage size (cubic feet)&amp;quot;,

&lt;p&gt;If you follow the mean lines from bottom to top, you will see that cars cluster into three groups according to their mean of luggage sizes. But differences are not huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insight 2: Cars cluster into three groups according to their mean luggage size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs focus. I am looking for the car with the biggest luggage space. Let‚Äôs see what other VClass types are in our dataset that we can include our exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 34 types of vehicle classes (Vlass) in our dataset. I will subset all the relevant ones, leaving some specialty vehicles and vans aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have a look at other VClass types with this code here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;big_epa_cars %&amp;gt;% group_by(VClass) %&amp;gt;% count() %&amp;gt;% arrange(desc(n))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also remove minor brands with less than 10 models in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;big_filtered &amp;lt;- big_sub %&amp;gt;% 
  filter(VClass %in% c(&amp;quot;Large Cars&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Compact Cars&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Midsize Cars&amp;quot;, 
                       &amp;quot;Midsize Station Wagons&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Midsize-Large Station Wagons&amp;quot;,
                       &amp;quot;Minivan - 2WD&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Minivan - 4WD&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;% 
  group_by(make) %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(n=n()) %&amp;gt;% 
  filter(n &amp;gt; 10) %&amp;gt;% 
  ungroup()

dim(big_filtered)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 14710    11&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be on the safe side for the family trip, I will choose cars not older than 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Cars ordered with luggage volume, but not older than 5 years 
# and lv4 bigger than 5

q &amp;lt;- big_filtered %&amp;gt;% 
  filter(year &amp;gt; 2016, lv4 &amp;gt; 5) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(make = fct_reorder(make, lv4)) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=make, y=lv4, col=make)) + 
  geom_boxplot(varwidth=TRUE) +
  theme(text = element_text(size=15),
        legend.position = &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;) +
  coord_flip()
q&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are not big differences between average luggage size of different brands. Although, you will probably get more space if you choose a Volkswagen or Ford rather than a BMW or Chevrolet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real XL luggage volume cars are plenty and seem to be more outlier models. To find our dream car let‚Äôs focus on those outliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will create a new data frame &lt;strong&gt;boot_space&lt;/strong&gt; containing the top 50 cars according to the luggage volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;boot_space &amp;lt;- big_filtered %&amp;gt;%

&lt;p&gt;We found our answer and our camping gear is ready. Let‚Äôs tackle some other questions. We hear a lot about them but how does the future looks like for Electric cars?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Electric and Non Electric car models follows a similar increase in the last 10 years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increases in Electric car models in the last years might be a reflection of a general increase in total number of model types&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Add custom summary statistics in ggplot2</title>
      <link>/r/stats-ggplot/</link>

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to understand your data by looking at the numbers on a csv file. You need to plot it. And adding statistics to your plots will make it more informative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate data, we typically use &lt;strong&gt;mean&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;median&lt;/strong&gt; to define its central tendency and &lt;strong&gt;range, quartiles, variance&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;standard deviation&lt;/strong&gt; to define how spread it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mean&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;standard deviation&lt;/strong&gt; is a good representation of the data if we don‚Äôt have extreme values that result in a skewed distribution. But, if we have outliers they might misguide us. In those conditions, &lt;code&gt;median&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;quartiles&lt;/code&gt; will serve us better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Median&lt;/strong&gt; is the central point which divides the data into half. &lt;strong&gt;Quartiles&lt;/strong&gt; are used to describe the spread of the data. The word comes from the Medieval Latin ‚Äúquartilis‚Äù which means fourth and &lt;strong&gt;quartiles break the data into four equal parts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    The advantage is that they are much less effected by the outliers or skeweness of the data.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, &lt;strong&gt;quartiles are often used along with the median as the best measures of spread.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are often expressed as an &lt;strong&gt;Interquartile range (IQR)&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the interval between first and third quartiles and represents 50% of the data points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you measured height of adults in a population, with Interquartile range you can describe a discrete interval centered around the median including 50% of the measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a representative graph.&lt;img src=&#34;/img/quartiles.png&#34; alt=&#34;graph:wikipedia&#34; /&gt;[source:wikipedia]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-to-include-statistics-in-ggplot2&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to include statistics in ggplot2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stats make it easier to grasp the data. And &lt;strong&gt;different statistics are suited for different data types&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, you may want to show &lt;code&gt;a 95% confidence interval? or mean? median?&lt;/code&gt; or any other statistics which captures the details best for your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So let‚Äôs go through on an example data&lt;/strong&gt; to understand how statistics can be overlayed in ggplot2. The data is about the effects of two Herbicides (glyphosate &amp;amp; bentazone) on the yield of white mustard (Sinapis alba) seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, import ggplot2 package and read in the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(ggplot2)
path &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;C:/Users/serda/Downloads/S.alba.csv&amp;quot;
data &amp;lt;- read.csv(path)
str(data)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## &amp;#39;data.frame&amp;#39;:    68 obs. of  4 variables:
##  $ X        : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
##  $ Dose     : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 ...
##  $ Herbicide: Factor w/ 2 levels &amp;quot;Bentazone&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Glyphosate&amp;quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...
##  $ DryMatter: num  4.7 4.6 4.1 4.4 3.2 3 3.8 3.9 3.8 3.8 ...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These chemicals used at 8 different doses and the yield is measured. I will convert the dose variable as a factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data$Dose &amp;lt;- as.factor(data$Dose)
levels(data$Dose)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;0&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;10&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;20&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;40&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;80&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;160&amp;quot; &amp;quot;320&amp;quot; &amp;quot;640&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can make an initial plot to visualize the data. We‚Äôll plot the yield variable &lt;code&gt;DryMatter&lt;/code&gt; against &lt;code&gt;Dose&lt;/code&gt; of the Herbicides. We can assign &lt;code&gt;col&lt;/code&gt; argument to map different chemical compounds to different colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# I will define a dodge and jitterdodge object to avoid overlapping data points 
# or stats that we will overlay later
posn.d &amp;lt;- position_dodge(width=0.2)
posn.jd &amp;lt;- position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.1, dodge.width=0.2)
p &amp;lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x=Dose, y=DryMatter, col=Herbicide, fill=Herbicide, 
                      group=Herbicide ))
p + geom_point(position =posn.jd)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-10-16-add-custom-summary-statistics-into-your-ggplot_files/figure-html/visualize%20the%20data-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we see here is that, at low doses both Herbicides led similar yields but starting from Dose 40 we see a drastic negative impact of Benzoate on yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that plot, I want to overlay the &lt;code&gt;min&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;max&lt;/code&gt; and also &lt;code&gt;median&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Interquartile range&lt;/code&gt; for each set of yield measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many default functions in ggplot2 which can be used directly such as &lt;strong&gt;mean_sdl(), mean_cl_normal()&lt;/strong&gt; to add stats in stat_summary() layer. But, I will create custom functions here so that we can grasp better what is happening behind the scenes on ggplot2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will create one function to calculate the &lt;strong&gt;median&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;interquartile range(IQR) 1-3&lt;/strong&gt;, and another to calculate min(), max() values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    In order to use the results of a function directly in ggplot2 we need to &lt;strong&gt;ensure that the names of the variables match the aesthetics needed for our respective geoms&lt;/strong&gt;.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Function for median and IQR

median_IQR &amp;lt;- function(x) {
  data.frame(y = median(x), # Median
             ymin = quantile(x)[2], # 1st quartile
             ymax = quantile(x)[4])  # 3rd quartile
}

# Function for min, max values
range &amp;lt;- function(x) {
  data.frame(ymin=min(x),
             ymax=max(x))
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs replot with the statistics we wanted to overlay. You can use two &lt;code&gt;stat_summary()&lt;/code&gt; layers to add our stats. You can set the &lt;code&gt;fun.data&lt;/code&gt; argument to the specific function defined above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Updated plot
p + 
  stat_summary(geom = &amp;quot;linerange&amp;quot;,
                 fun.data = median_IQR, 
                 position = posn.d, 
                 size=3) + 
  stat_summary(geom = &amp;quot;linerange&amp;quot;, 
               fun.data = range, 
               position = posn.d, 
               size=3, 
               alpha=0.5)+ 
  stat_summary(geom = &amp;quot;point&amp;quot;, 
               fun.y = &amp;quot;median&amp;quot;, 
               position = posn.d, 
               size = 3, 
               col = &amp;quot;black&amp;quot;, 
               shape = &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-10-16-add-custom-summary-statistics-into-your-ggplot_files/figure-html/visualize%20with%20stats-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, to the first plot here we easily see where the median and IQR lays. We can make our comparisions easier. Starting from dose 20, we see that glyphosate clearly outperforms bentazone. Big separation between the IQRs are obvious at doses 40 and 80. At higher doses, differences in IQRs starts to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;conclusions&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ggplot2 is a flexible package and knowing its intricacies will help you level up your visuals. To understand your data and to convey the insights you want to point out, you can include your choice of custom functions in ggplot &lt;code&gt;stat_summary()&lt;/code&gt; layer similarly as we did above or use the default functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data we have here was small. With bigger data, it is more crucial to overlay summary statistics of interest for effective visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serdar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Accessing different data sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the data you need is available on the web. Accessing those will ease your life as a data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to perform an exploratory data analysis on &lt;strong&gt;2018/19 Season of England Premier league&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there changes in team performances during the season timeline?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does some teams cluster?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which is the earliest week we can predict team‚Äôs final positions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need the &lt;strong&gt;standings table&lt;/strong&gt; for each week of the season and integrate them in a way that will allow me to plot the graphs that I want.
We will scrap those tables from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.weltfussball.de/&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://www.weltfussball.de/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img src=&#34;/img/welt.png&#34; alt=&#34;welt&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example standings table for the Week 1 is at the url:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.weltfussball.de/spielplan/eng-premier-league-2018-2019-spieltag/1&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://www.weltfussball.de/spielplan/eng-premier-league-2018-2019-spieltag/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the consequent weeks only the number at the end changes e.g.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.weltfussball.de/spielplan/eng-premier-league-2018-2019-spieltag/2&#34;&gt;../spielplan/eng-premier-league-2018-2019-spieltag/&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ‚Üê&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.weltfussball.de/spielplan/eng-premier-league-2018-2019-spieltag/3&#34;&gt;../spielplan/eng-premier-league-2018-2019-spieltag/&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ‚Üê&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Pull the necessary packages  

library(rvest)     # xml2
library(tidyverse) # ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, 
                   # purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats
library(gganimate)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(kableExtra)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Define the remote url
baseUrl &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;https://www.weltfussball.de/&amp;quot;
path &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;spielplan/eng-premier-league-2018-2019-spieltag/&amp;quot;
fileName &amp;lt;- 1
url &amp;lt;- paste0(baseUrl, path, fileName)
url&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;https://www.weltfussball.de/spielplan/eng-premier-league-2018-2019-spieltag/1&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start by downloading and parsing the file with &lt;strong&gt;read_html()&lt;/strong&gt; function from the rvest package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tables &amp;lt;- read_html(url)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extract the html table individually you can use &lt;strong&gt;XPath&lt;/strong&gt; syntax which defines parts on XML documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the XPath for standings table open the url on google chrome,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hover the mouse over the table &amp;gt; right click &amp;gt; inspect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
# This will open inspector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move your mouse a few lines up or down to find the line where whole table is highlighted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click &amp;gt; Copy &amp;gt; Copy full XPath&lt;img src=&#34;/img/weltxpath.png&#34; alt=&#34;weltxpath&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can feed that XPath we copied to html_nodes() function and extract the node which contains the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;xpath = &amp;quot;/html/body/div[3]/div[2]/div[4]/div[2]/div[1]/div/div[7]/div/table[1]&amp;quot;
nodes &amp;lt;- html_nodes(tables, xpath = xpath)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, html_table() function will extract us the individual table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;html_table(nodes)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonderful, we scraped the standings table for the first week, but we want tables for each 38 week of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can make this easily by packing what we have done so far in a for loop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As only the last number in our url link changes, we can code different url addresses as in &lt;code&gt;url[[i]] &amp;lt;- paste0(baseUrl, path, i)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Create emtpy lists
url &amp;lt;- list()
pages &amp;lt;- list()
nodes &amp;lt;- list()
final &amp;lt;- list()
start &amp;lt;- Sys.time()
# For loop.
# It will connect one by one to 38 different url links predefined 
# by the line starting with url[[i]]
# Collect the information with read_html(), html_nodes() and html_table()
# Finally each table will be converted to a data frame
for(i in 1:38){
url[[i]] &amp;lt;- paste0(baseUrl, path, i)
pages[[i]] &amp;lt;- read_html(url[[i]])
nodes[[i]] &amp;lt;- html_nodes(pages[[i]], xpath = xpath)
final[[i]] &amp;lt;- data.frame(html_table(nodes[[i]]))
}

# By coding start and end times of the whole process 
# I can keep an eye on how fast my code is.
end &amp;lt;- Sys.time()
end-start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Time difference of 22.62705 secs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;code&gt;final[[19]]&lt;/code&gt; will give me standings of mid season:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;final[[19]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt mind the NAs in the second column, we will remove them soon.
Now, we have all 38 table in our list &lt;strong&gt;final&lt;/strong&gt;, we can combine them to a new data frame which will contain standings of the whole season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to plot e.g.¬†timeline, let‚Äôs keep the tidy data principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each observation has its own row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each variable has its own column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we have same column names in each table, we can use &lt;strong&gt;rbind&lt;/strong&gt; function to add rows of each table to the bottom of the first one. How to do that? We can‚Äôt use lapply() function here. It will not combine elements in a list. We can use &lt;strong&gt;do.call() function to perform the rbind() operation and combine all data frames we have&lt;/strong&gt;*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;uk18 &amp;lt;-  do.call(&amp;quot;rbind&amp;quot;, final)
dim(uk18)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 760  10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head(uk18)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##   X. Mannschaft    Mannschaft.1 Sp. S. U. N. Tore Dif. Pk.
## 1  1         NA    Liverpool FC   1  1  0  0  4:0    4   3
## 2  2         NA      Chelsea FC   1  1  0  0  3:0    3   3
## 3  3         NA AFC Bournemouth   1  1  0  0  2:0    2   3

## 6 NA         NA      Watford FC   1  1  0  0  2:0    2   3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Column names/shorcuts were in German, let‚Äôs replace them with the English words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Correct final table
uk18 &amp;lt;- uk18  %&amp;gt;% select(3:10)

               &amp;quot;difference&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;points&amp;quot;)
colnames(uk18) &amp;lt;- new_names&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals variable is contains two different data separated with ‚Äú:‚Äù. &lt;code&gt;E.g. (4:0)&lt;/code&gt;. Those represent goals scored:goals scored against. Let‚Äôs split goals column into two by &lt;strong&gt;separate() function from tidyr&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;uk18 &amp;lt;- uk18 %&amp;gt;% separate(goals, c(&amp;quot;scored&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;against&amp;quot;), sep=&amp;quot;\\:&amp;quot;)
head(uk18)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##              team week won drawn lost scored against difference points
## 1    Liverpool FC    1   1     0    0      4       0          4      3
## 2      Chelsea FC    1   1     0    0      3       0          3      3

## 4  Crystal Palace    1   1     0    0      2       0          2      3
## 5 Manchester City    1   1     0    0      2       0          2      3
## 6      Watford FC    1   1     0    0      2       0          2      3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to order my legend with the same order of teams final positions&lt;/strong&gt;. Let‚Äôs filter for the last week of the season and arrange them in descending order. I will assign this list to the factor levels of the team variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Extract team names in the order as the season end

Some insights from the plots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I see three clusters here. Two teams (Man. City and Liverpool) competed head to head for the championship and next three teams (Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal) for the 3rd position.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can predict 4 out of 5 teams which will take first 5 place at the end of the season early as week 10.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manchester United showed peak performance mid season, Everton have improved performances while Tottenham slowed down (which costed them 3rd position) in the second part of the season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can plot points against goal differences in the same plot. Same clusters pop up here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;uk &amp;lt;- ggplot(uk18, aes(x=difference, y=points, col=team)) + 
  geom_point(size=2) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = getPalette(colorCount)) + 
  theme(text = element_text(size=15))
uk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-10-10-data-preparation-web-scraping-data-tables-with-rvest_files/figure-html/points%20vs%20goal%20differences-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs visualize this in a small animation. You can create an animated plot of the teams progress during the season. Gganimate does good job.`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Add a shadow tail
# anim + shadow_wake(wake_length = 0.3, alpha = FALSE)
 
anim &amp;lt;- uk +

             shadow_wake(wake_length = 0.1, alpha = 0.5)

&lt;li&gt;How to find the &lt;strong&gt;XPath&lt;/strong&gt; for an &lt;strong&gt;html table&lt;/strong&gt; in a website?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to &lt;strong&gt;combine data frames&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;a list&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to &lt;strong&gt;split columns&lt;/strong&gt; containing more than one variable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest time, we can predict top teams final positions was around 10th. We can collect data from previous years or compare other countries leagues to check if we can generalize this finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else we can ask? For example, we can connect performance changes to new transfers. Or whether changing coaches benefited any team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we saw web is a great source for data. If you want to use it more effectively, learn about different data formats such as JSON or XML and interact with APIs, here is a great course from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-web-data-in-r&#34;&gt;Datacamp.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please share if you have other ideas in the comments below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ggplot2 is a powerful data visualization tool of R. Make quick visualizations to explore or share your insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning how aesthetics and attributes are defined in ggplot will give you an edge to develop your skills quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;ggplot2-tips-distinction-between-aesthetics-and-attributes&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ggplot2 tips: distinction between aesthetics and attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aesthetics are defined inside &lt;strong&gt;aes()&lt;/strong&gt; in ggplot syntax and attributes are outside the aes().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.g.¬†ggplot(data, aes(x, y, &lt;strong&gt;color=var1&lt;/strong&gt;) + geom_point&lt;strong&gt;(size=6)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We typically understand &lt;strong&gt;aesthetics&lt;/strong&gt; as how something looks, color, size etc.&lt;br /&gt;
But in ggplot‚Äôs world how things look is just an &lt;strong&gt;attribute.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Aesthetics do not refer how something looks, &lt;strong&gt;but to which variable is mapped onto it.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will create an imaginary data frame to apply those concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(ggplot2)
points &amp;lt;- 500
# Defining the Golden Angle
angle &amp;lt;- pi*(3-sqrt(5))
t &amp;lt;- (1:points) * angle
x &amp;lt;- sin(t/2)
y &amp;lt;-cos(t/2)
z &amp;lt;- rep(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), times=50)
w &amp;lt;- rep(c(1,2), times=250)
df &amp;lt;- data.frame(t, x, y, z, w)
# Have a look at the data
head(df)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##           t          x           y z w
## 1  2.399963  0.9320324  0.36237489 1 1
## 2  4.799926  0.6754903 -0.73736888 2 2
## 3  7.199890 -0.4424710 -0.89678282 3 1
## 4  9.599853 -0.9961710  0.08742572 4 2
## 5 11.999816 -0.2795038  0.96014460 5 1
## 6 14.399779  0.7936008  0.60843886 6 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataframe we created has 3 numeric (t, x, y) variables and 2 discrete variables (z, w). With ggplot2 I can map any of the variables on my plot by defining them inside the &lt;strong&gt;aes().&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Make a scatter plot of points of a spiral
p &amp;lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x*t, y*t))
p + geom_point()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-10-08-what-is-aesthetics-and-atributes-in-ggplot-s-world_files/figure-html/ggplot%20main%20spiral-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;example-use-of-an-aesthetics&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example use of an aesthetics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By defining col=factor(z) inside aes(), I can map z to colors. So now the graph shows x, y and also values z.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Make a scatter plot of points in a spiral
p &amp;lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x*t, y*t, col=factor(z)))
p + geom_point()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-10-08-what-is-aesthetics-and-atributes-in-ggplot-s-world_files/figure-html/Map%20z%20on%20color-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each different color now represents different values of z.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;example-use-of-an-attribute&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example use of an attribute&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attribute is how somethings looks. e.g.¬†you can the points bigger by defining size=4. But it does not give any extra information about data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Make a scatter plot of points in a spiral
p &amp;lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x*t, y*t, col=factor(z)))
p + geom_point(size = 4)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-10-08-what-is-aesthetics-and-atributes-in-ggplot-s-world_files/figure-html/main%20spiral%20colored-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;use-shape-as-an-attribute&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use shape as an attribute&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same goes here. I am changing how something looks like. The data point shape change to 24 which defines a empty triangle. But nothing is mapped onto it. It is just an attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Make a scatter plot of points in a spiral
p &amp;lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x*t, y*t, color=factor(z)))
p + geom_point(shape=24, size=4)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-10-08-what-is-aesthetics-and-atributes-in-ggplot-s-world_files/figure-html/spiral%20colors%20with%20triangles-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
Here, x&lt;em&gt;t, y&lt;/em&gt;t and factor(z) is mapped on to our graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;using-shape-as-an-aesthetics&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using shape as an aesthetics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By defining shape and color inside aes() I can map w and z to my plot as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;points &amp;lt;- 500
# Defining the Golden Angle
angle &amp;lt;- pi*(3-sqrt(5))
t &amp;lt;- (1:points) * angle
x &amp;lt;- sin(t)
y &amp;lt;-cos(t)
z &amp;lt;- rep(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), times=50)
w &amp;lt;- rep(c(1,2), times=250)
df &amp;lt;- data.frame(t, x, y, z, w)

p &amp;lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x*t, y*t, shape=factor(w), color=factor(z)))
p + geom_point(size=3)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-10-08-what-is-aesthetics-and-atributes-in-ggplot-s-world_files/figure-html/aa-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spirals look nice and we got some basics of ggplot. Now let‚Äôs use it to create a pattern designer, with Shiny. Many patterns in Nature can be explained by mathematical terms, Shapes of sunflowers, dandelions or snowflakes etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will tell the rest of the story in the next update. Now you can play with the app to create your patterns!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;1000&#34; height=&#34;800&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://korur.shinyapps.io/designapattern/&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time!&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Why not everyone who smokes develop cancer or who eats a lot develop fatty liver disease? Predicting diseases with machine learning</title>
      <link>/r/predict-diseases/</link>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;We are much better at handling diseases than 30 years ago. For example &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataatomic.com/r/ggplot2-waffle/&#34;&gt;cancer survival rates&lt;/a&gt; are much higher now. The significant portion of this increase &lt;strong&gt;can be attributed directly to our ability to detect and diagnose cancer earlier.&lt;/strong&gt; Also, use of insulin and other drugs to control blood glucose in diabetic patients reduced the risk of developing coronary diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
We are at constant hunt for finding new evidence &lt;strong&gt;which environmental factors put us at risk for which diseases.&lt;/strong&gt; Exposure to certain chemicals (smoking, industry workers) can cause certain types of cancer and our eating habits might put us at higher risk for developing diseases such us diabetes or liver fibrosis.
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:unnamed-chunk-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/heather-ford-Fq54FqucgCE-unsplash.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo by Heather Ford on Unsplash&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 1: Photo by Heather Ford on Unsplash
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But not everyone who smokes develop lung cancer or who eats a lot of sugar develop fatty liver disease.&lt;/strong&gt; Our genetic background makes us prone or immune to develop different diseases. &lt;strong&gt;This is where data science might enable us with new insights connecting the risk factors to our genetic make up.&lt;/strong&gt; And the better we are at identifying high risk patients the better treatment for the patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are developing new technologies at lightning speed. We can now analyse genes from a single cell which was not even possible couple of years back, and extract the knowledge hidden in rare genes or rare cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensors collect real time data from patients e.g.¬†in diabetic patients, we started to pool data (real world evidence) generated during the actual use of drugs by patients (e.g.¬†&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/the-common-data-model/&#34;&gt;OMOP common data model&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;The data that we have access now is enormous and is growing rapidly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Science&lt;/strong&gt; tools are more than ever needed to mold this data into better therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can build new machine learning models and;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;diagnose diseases earlier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;develop better drugs which are more effective and have less side effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;identify patient groups which benefit most from existing drugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be able to understand why certain diseases develop and their connections to our lifestyle by using multiple types of data we accumulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let‚Äôs look at an example&lt;/strong&gt; and see how we can do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First part in any data science process is &lt;strong&gt;problem formulation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;problem-formulation&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Problem formulation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our problem, or question that we want to answer is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we predict which patients will develop Diabetes by building a Machine learning algorithm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will predict a Binary &lt;strong&gt;Outcome&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;Diabetes&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;Healthy&lt;/code&gt;
by using 8 medical indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;overview-of-the-data&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Overview of the data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pima Indians of Arizona and Mexico&lt;/strong&gt; have contributed to numerous scientific gains. Their involvement has led to significant findings on genetics of both &lt;strong&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;obesity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medical indicators recorded are;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pregnancies:&lt;/strong&gt; Number of times pregnant&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Glucose:&lt;/strong&gt; Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BloodPressure:&lt;/strong&gt; Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;SkinThickness:&lt;/strong&gt; Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Insulin:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BMI:&lt;/strong&gt; Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;DiabetesPedigreeFunction:&lt;/strong&gt; Diabetes pedigree function&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Age:&lt;/strong&gt; Age (years)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Outcome:&lt;/strong&gt; Class variable (0 or 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;data-acquisition&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data acquisition&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database&#34;&gt;Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset&lt;/a&gt; from Kaggle and load it in RStudio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up and loading in the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;diabetes &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;posts_data/diabetes.csv&amp;quot;)
library(tidyverse) # Includes packages: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, 
                   # purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats
library(reshape2) # Main function: melt()
library(ggcorrplot)
library(pROC)
library(lattice)
library(caret)
library(waffle)
library(compareGroups) # Main functions: compareGroups(), createTable()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next step in our data science process is to check whether the data quality is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;data-quality-control&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data Quality control&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before running any algorithm a good starting point is to &lt;strong&gt;check obvious mistakes and abnormalities in your data.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would first look at &lt;strong&gt;Missing values&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;NAs&lt;/strong&gt;, variable ranges (&lt;strong&gt;min, max values&lt;/strong&gt;). A very extreme value might be basically a typing error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;understand-your-data&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understand your Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How big is the data? Classes of variables?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dim(diabetes)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 768   9&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;knitr::kable(sapply(diabetes, class))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look which atomic data types my variables are. I see that the outcome variable is represented as an &lt;strong&gt;integer.&lt;/strong&gt; We will keep this in mind because many machine learning models will accept the binary outcome when converted to a factor atomic data type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, what catches my attention is &lt;strong&gt;unexpected zeros in Insulin&lt;/strong&gt;. See below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plotting how the variables are distributed will give a good overview to spot problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will change the data format so that I can plot all the variables in different facets. &lt;strong&gt;melt()&lt;/strong&gt; function from reshape2 package can create a tall version of my data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This function will collect all variable names in one column and corresponding values in the next column.&lt;/strong&gt; This data structure will allow me to plot all variables together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gg &amp;lt;- melt(diabetes)

# Check how the new data structure looks like
head(gg)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##      variable value
## 1 Pregnancies     6
## 2 Pregnancies     1
## 3 Pregnancies     8
## 4 Pregnancies     1
## 5 Pregnancies     0
## 6 Pregnancies     5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Plot all variables
ggplot(gg, aes(x=value, fill=variable)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=5) + 
  theme(legend.position = &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;) +
  facet_wrap(~variable) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-10-01-can-machine-learning-change-your-life-style_files/figure-html/Check%20out%20how%20the%20variables%20are%20distributed-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple variables have peaks at zero. E.g. Skin Thickness and Insulin. It is not possible that those variables are zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to know how many zeros each variables has. In cases where the numbers are small we might remove them. &lt;strong&gt;Let‚Äôs figure it out with a for loop.&lt;/strong&gt; and then visualize on a waffle plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am selecting only variables from 2 to 6 because only those can‚Äôt be zero. Let‚Äôs count number of zeros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to count zeros in each column?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Using a for loop, which() function and []&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;zero_rows &amp;lt;- list()
for(i in 2:6){
zero_rows[[i]] &amp;lt;- length(which(diabetes[,i] == 0))  
}
rows_with_zero &amp;lt;- unlist(zero_rows)
rows_with_zero&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1]   5  35 227 374  11&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, I recommend using dplyr package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Much simpler with dplyr &lt;strong&gt;summarise_all()&lt;/strong&gt; function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;zeros &amp;lt;- diabetes[,2:6] %&amp;gt;%  summarise_all(funs(sum(.==0)))
t(zeros)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##               [,1]
## Glucose          5
## BloodPressure   35
## SkinThickness  227
## Insulin        374
## BMI             11&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feed those numbers into a waffle plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;zeros &amp;lt;- c(&amp;quot;Glucose&amp;quot; =zeros[1,1], &amp;quot;Blood Pressure&amp;quot; = zeros[1,2], 
           &amp;quot;Skin Thickness&amp;quot;= zeros[1,3], &amp;quot;Insulin&amp;quot; =zeros[1,4], 
           &amp;quot;BMI&amp;quot; = zeros[1,5])
waffle(zeros, rows=20) + 
  theme(text = element_text(size=15)) + 
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Number of rows with zero&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-10-01-can-machine-learning-change-your-life-style_files/figure-html/waffle%20plot%20of%20zero%20values-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;strong&gt;374&lt;/strong&gt; rows of Insulin are zero. Other variables also contain zeros. Something is wrong. It is impossible to have Blood Pressure or Glucose levels at 0. It is unlikely that those are simply entry mistakes. It seems missing values are filled with &lt;strong&gt;zeros&lt;/strong&gt; in the data collection phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to circumvent this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;convert-all-zeroes-to-nas-and-then-perform-median-imputation&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Convert all &lt;strong&gt;zeroes&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;NAs&lt;/strong&gt; and then perform &lt;strong&gt;Median Imputation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most models require numbers, and can‚Äôt handle missing data. Throwing out rows is not a good idea since it can lead to biases in your dataset and generate overconfident models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Median imputation lets you model data with missing values. By replacing them with their medians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, I need to change zeros to missing values. I will do this for all the predictors which zero is not plausible(columns 2 to 6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;for(i in 2:6){
# Convert zeros to NAs
diabetes[, i][diabetes[, i] == 0] &amp;lt;- NA
# Calculate median
median &amp;lt;- median(diabetes[, i], na.rm = TRUE)
diabetes[, i][is.na(diabetes[, i])] &amp;lt;- median
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check if it really happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;knitr::kable(head(diabetes))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, I see that zero values in the insulin variable is replaced with median of insulin which is 125.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also look at the differences between variables in diabetic versus healthy groups so that I know more which variables might play a role in the Outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can also use dplyr functions but I will use &lt;strong&gt;compareGroups&lt;/strong&gt; package because it creates a nice output of the summary statistics in a table format. compareGroups() function will do the analysis and createTable() will output it in a nice format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see here that couple of variables are significantly higher in diabetic patients, such as Pregnancies, glucose, insulin, bmi and so on. This can give hints on what to expect from the linear model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we made some visualizations to understand the dataset better, made some quality checks and cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, the data is ready for the modeling phase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Modeling the data (build, fit and validate a model)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going into any complicated model starting with a simple model is a good idea. It might do surprisingly well and will give us more insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;model-assumptions&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Model assumptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the assumptions of logistic regression that it requires large sample size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-should-be-the-minimum-sample-size-for-running-logistic-regression&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What should be the minimum sample size for running logistic regression?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimum sample size is given by the following formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N = 10 k / p&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p is the proportion of the least frequent class of the Outcome variable. We have 768 cases of which 500 are diabetic and 268 non diabetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p = 268/768 = 0.34&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And k is the number of covariates ( the number of predictor variables)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k = 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N = 10 * 8 / 268/768
N = 229&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we have a total of 768 cases we can apply logistic regression model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;logistic-regression-model&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logistic Regression Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will create two random subsets of our data in 80/20 proportion as &lt;strong&gt;training and test data.&lt;/strong&gt; Training data will be used to build our model and test data will be reserved to validate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summary shows us not all the variables play a role in predicting outcome. The significant correlations was found for Pregnancies, Glucose, BMI and Pedigree function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The predict function will give us probabilities. To compute our model accuracy we need to &lt;strong&gt;convert them to class predictions by setting a threshold level.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# We will predict the Outcome for the test data
p&amp;lt;-predict(glm_dia, dia_test)
# Choose a threshold 0.5 to calculate the accuracy of our model
p_05 &amp;lt;- ifelse(p &amp;gt; 0.5, 1, 0)

## p_05  0  1
##    0 88 23
##    1 12 31&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will build a confusion matrix to calculate how accurate our model is in this particular random train/test split and at 0.5 threshold level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;conf_mat &amp;lt;- table(p_05, dia_test$Outcome)
accuracy &amp;lt;- sum(diag(conf_mat))/sum(conf_mat)
accuracy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.7727273&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;roc&lt;/strong&gt; function pROC package, can plot us a ROC curve which tests accuracy of our model at multiple threshold levels and is a good estimate on how well our model is performing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Calculate AUC(Area under the curve)
roc(dia_test$Outcome, p)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Setting levels: control = 0, case = 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Setting direction: controls &amp;lt; cases&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Call:
## roc.default(response = dia_test$Outcome, predictor = p)
## 
## Data: p in 100 controls (dia_test$Outcome 0) &amp;lt; 54 cases (dia_test$Outcome 1).
## Area under the curve: 0.8446&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this process is little fragile, presence or absence of a single outlier might vastly change the results you might get from a given random train/test split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better approach than a simple train/test split is using multiple test sets and averaging their accuracies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs test that. I will create 1, 30 or 1000 random test sets, build models and compare their accuracies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-to-apply-multiple-traintest-split&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to apply multiple train/test split&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, I will &lt;strong&gt;write a function&lt;/strong&gt; where I can choose number of independent train/test splits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will return me an average value of the accuracy(auc) of the model after chosen number of iteration. The higher the number of random splits the more stable your estimated AUC will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs see how it will work out for our diabetes patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# I will define my function as follows
multi_split &amp;lt;- function(x){
sample_rows &amp;lt;- list()
dia_train &amp;lt;- list()
dia_test &amp;lt;- list()
glm &amp;lt;- list()
p &amp;lt;-  list()
roc_auc &amp;lt;- list()
for(i in 1:x){
  sample_rows[[i]] &amp;lt;- sample(nrow(diabetes), nrow(diabetes) * 0.8)
  # Create the training dataset
  dia_train[[i]] &amp;lt;- diabetes[sample_rows[[i]], ]
  # Create the test dataset
  dia_test[[i]] &amp;lt;- diabetes[-sample_rows[[i]], ]
  glm[[i]] &amp;lt;- glm(Outcome ~ .,data = dia_train[[i]], family = &amp;quot;binomial&amp;quot;)
  p[[i]] &amp;lt;- predict(glm[[i]], dia_test[[i]])
  
  # Calculate AUC for all &amp;quot;x&amp;quot; number of random splits
  roc_auc[[i]] &amp;lt;- roc(dia_test[[i]]$Outcome, p[[i]])$auc[1]
  glm_mean &amp;lt;- mean(unlist(roc_auc))
}
print(mean(unlist(roc_auc)))
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs calculate the average AUC of our model after different number of random splits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will run my &lt;strong&gt;multi_split() function&lt;/strong&gt; 3x for 1, 30 and 1000 random train/test splits. I can then compare variances at each level of sampling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the results from my multi_site function at each randomization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;auc_1_1 &amp;lt;- multi_split(1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.8737245&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;auc_1_2 &amp;lt;- multi_split(1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.8271277&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;auc_1_3 &amp;lt;- multi_split(1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.824344&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;auc_30_1 &amp;lt;- multi_split(30)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.8399321&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;auc_30_2 &amp;lt;- multi_split(30)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.8492238&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;auc_30_3 &amp;lt;- multi_split(30)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.8294277&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;auc_1000_1 &amp;lt;- multi_split(1000)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.8356283&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;auc_1000_2 &amp;lt;- multi_split(1000)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.836047&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;auc_1000_3 &amp;lt;- multi_split(1000)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.8345809&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs compare Variance levels at &lt;strong&gt;1, 30 and 1000&lt;/strong&gt; random splits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;var(c(auc_1_1, auc_1_2, auc_1_3))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.0007695739&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;var(c(auc_30_1, auc_30_2, auc_30_3))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 9.809343e-05&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;var(c(auc_1000_1, auc_1000_2, auc_1000_3))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 5.702925e-07&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we see here as we increase the number of iterations to 30 and 1000 the variability
gradually stabilizes around a trustable AUC of &lt;code&gt;0.835&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great. We have an estimate of our model performance after 1000 random train/test splits. This process is also called &lt;strong&gt;Monte-Carlo Cross validation.&lt;/strong&gt; This approach might give you a less variable, but more biased estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more common approach to estimate model performance is &lt;strong&gt;k-Fold cross Validation.&lt;/strong&gt; Where the samples divided into k-folds and one fold is used as a test set, and the remaining k-1 as the training set. This process is run k times until all folds appear once in the test sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Logistic regression model with k-fold Cross Validation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will switch here to caret package. With the &lt;strong&gt;Train()&lt;/strong&gt; function we can test different types of machine learning algorithms and set the cross validation parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the models below comparable I will create &lt;strong&gt;a custom cross validation fold object (d_folds)&lt;/strong&gt; that I can apply to multiple models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will repeat the logistic regression model with 5 fold cross validation and then we can compare it to monte carlo cross validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we see in the plot, ridge regression (alpha = 0) performed better than the lasso at all lambda values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glmnet model performance is &lt;code&gt;0.8242214&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Random forest model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big diferences between random forest and linear models is that they require ‚Äútuning.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperparameters ‚Äì&amp;gt; How the model is fit. Selected by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advantages: no need to log transform or normalize,
but they are less interpretable and slower than glmnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random forests &lt;strong&gt;capture threshold effects and variable interactions. both of which occur often in real world data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mtry&lt;/strong&gt; is the number of variables used at each split point in individual decision tree that make up the rf. Default is 3, I will use here 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tuneLength = how many different mtry values to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used different machine learning algorithms to predict Diabetes. Models showed similar performances except the naives bayes which performed worst. &lt;strong&gt;As we saw, our simple glm model performance was very close to other more advanced algorithms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help doctors to predict &lt;strong&gt;Diabetes with accuracy around 83%&lt;/strong&gt; by using 8 simple medical parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given current speed in generation and collection of types data by including additional predictors we can build even better models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data Wrangling for Text mining: Extract individual elements from a Book</title>

&lt;p&gt;My ambitious goal is to write a machine learning algorithm that predicts authors. But let‚Äôs start with something simpler. An important part in a Data Science workflow is data preparation. &lt;strong&gt;Clean it, reformat it and make it usable for further analysis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:unnamed-chunk-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will work on a Poetry book called ‚ÄúNew Poems‚Äù from D. H. Lawrence. You can download it from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gutenberg.org/&#34;&gt;Project Gutenberg website&lt;/a&gt; which is a library of over 60,000 free eBooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The goal is to isolate each poem individually for text mining analysis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs figure out a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    I will use the table of contents section to &lt;strong&gt;fish out each poem separately&lt;/strong&gt; by using two &lt;strong&gt;for loops.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;install-required-packages&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Install required packages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(stringi)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;copy-the-book-from-dh-lawrence-new-poems&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Copy the book from DH Lawrence ‚ÄúNew Poems‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At gutenberg website there are couple of slightly different formats of the book. Since there were some mistakes in the .txt file I used
the html version &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22726/22726-h/22726-h.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I copied the text and pasted it in a text editor and saved to my working directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lawrence &amp;lt;- readLines(&amp;quot;posts_data/lawrence_new_poems.txt&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our file contains &lt;code&gt;2181&lt;/code&gt; lines. With square brackets [ ] we can view the lines we want. Let‚Äôs look at the first few lines;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lawrence[1:5]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;&amp;quot;

## [4] &amp;quot;This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with&amp;quot;    
## [5] &amp;quot;almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22726/22726-h/22726-h.htm&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; has 42 poems in total. Table of contents (TOC) starts with the line ‚ÄúCONTENTS‚Äù and ends with the line ‚ÄúON THAT DAY‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will use those lines to extract the TOC. Stringr package comes in handy here. &lt;strong&gt;str_which()&lt;/strong&gt; function returns line index numbers for a given term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;start &amp;lt;- str_which(lawrence, pattern = fixed(&amp;quot;CONTENTS&amp;quot;))
start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 53&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lawrence[start]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;CONTENTS&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# We are choosing first appearance of &amp;quot;ON THAT DAY&amp;quot; with [1] because it appears 
# also in the Poem title later.
end &amp;lt;-  str_which(lawrence, pattern = fixed(&amp;quot;ON THAT DAY&amp;quot;))[1]
end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 137&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lawrence[end]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;ON THAT DAY&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slicing the lines from &lt;code&gt;54&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;137&lt;/code&gt; will give us the TOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;TOC &amp;lt;- lawrence[(start+1):(end)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remove empty spaces I will use here &lt;strong&gt;stri_remove_empty()&lt;/strong&gt; function from &lt;strong&gt;stringi&lt;/strong&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;TOC &amp;lt;- stri_remove_empty(TOC)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs look at how the clean TOC looks.&lt;/p&gt;

## [41] &amp;quot;AUTUMN SUNSHINE&amp;quot;            &amp;quot;ON THAT DAY&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we will extract main text containing only the poems without TOC and other metadata. We need to slice the document starting from the end of the contents &lt;code&gt;(end)&lt;/code&gt; till end of the last poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# After the last poem some metadata starts with &amp;quot;End of the Project...&amp;quot;
# We will slice until this line
end_main &amp;lt;- str_which(lawrence, &amp;quot;End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of New Poems, by D. H. Lawrence&amp;quot;)
# Capture main text
lawrence_body &amp;lt;- lawrence[(end+1):(end_main -1)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we have TOC and main body of the book as two separate objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;first-for-loop&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First for loop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use TOC and a &lt;code&gt;for loop&lt;/code&gt; to get the index numbers of the title‚Äôs of each poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# First initiate an empty list
index &amp;lt;- list()
# For loop
for (i in 1:42) {
index[[i]] &amp;lt;- str_which(lawrence_body, pattern = TOC[i])
}

index&amp;lt;- unlist(index)
index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##  [1]    9   37   59   82  110  126  164  192  209  253  276  314  332  347
## [15]  387  428  473  496  536  570  593  621  768  664  707  745  621  768
## [29]  901  933  958  990 1057 1100 1193 1253 1286 1313 1376 1502 1527 1571
## [43] 1606 1644&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;for loop&lt;/code&gt; we created here uses each title in TOC as a pattern inside a &lt;strong&gt;str_which()&lt;/strong&gt; function to find the index number where it detects this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example TOC[1] will use the title of first poem as a pattern and it will return the line number where the poem starts. &lt;strong&gt;At the end, we will have a list of starting lines of each poem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;TOC[1]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;APPREHENSION&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;str_which(lawrence_body, pattern = TOC[1])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 9&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# e.g. The poem Apprehension starts at line index number 9&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting the lines from the beginning of the &lt;strong&gt;first poem&lt;/strong&gt; until the beginning of the &lt;strong&gt;second poem&lt;/strong&gt; will give us the first poem. By iterating everything by +1 we will capture all 42 poems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the title EMBANKMENT AT NIGHT appears in the titles of two poems we will do a slight correction here. To correct this, I will remove first appearance of index 768 and second appearance of 621.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;index &amp;lt;- index[-c(23,27)]
index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##  [1]    9   37   59   82  110  126  164  192  209  253  276  314  332  347
## [15]  387  428  473  496  536  570  593  621  664  707  745  768  901  933
## [29]  958  990 1057 1100 1193 1253 1286 1313 1376 1502 1527 1571 1606 1644&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;length(index)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Not to miss the last poem, I have to add the line index of the
# end of the main text. We can use the end of the main body as above.
index[43] &amp;lt;- end_main -1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we have 42 index numbers matching the title of each poem 1 index number to label the end of the main text. We will use those to extract poems separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;second-for-loop&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Second for loop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs time for the trick. Finally we can capture each 42 poem separately in a list by using a second &lt;code&gt;for loop.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Create an empty list: poems
poems &amp;lt;- list()
for (i in 1:42) {
    
    poems[[i]] &amp;lt;- lawrence_body[(index[i]:index[i+1]-1)]  
}
# Visualize the first poem
writeLines(poems[[1]])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## APPREHENSION
## AND all hours long, the town
##        Roars like a beast in a cave
##      That is wounded there
##      And like to drown;
##        While days rush, wave after wave
##      On its lair.
## 
##      An invisible woe unseals
##        The flood, so it passes beyond
##      All bounds: the great old city
##      Recumbent roars as it feels
##        The foamy paw of the pond
##      Reach from immensity.
## 
##      But all that it can do

##      Waves crash like thunder through
##        The splintered streets, hear noises
##      Roll hollow in the interim.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs check if we got what we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Preparation&lt;/strong&gt; is a crucial step in Data Science as data comes rarely ready to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, starting from a Poetry Book I isolated each poem separately in a list. Hard part is done. &lt;strong&gt;Now, I can identify how many rhymes each poem contains, word usage across different poems, the similarities between them and many more to gain insights about the author.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could also analyze the whole book as a single document but by isolating each element I will gain much deeper insight from the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you apply similar techniques to isolate chapters or sections from the book or documents to compare and contrast different parts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this post. Please feel free to comment below with your thoughts/feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Genomics at superresolution: Mapping Drug targets on single cell resolution in Fibrosis</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Advances in &lt;strong&gt;microfluidic technologies&lt;/strong&gt; enabled us to barcode single cells in lipid droplets and to &lt;strong&gt;resolve genomes of individual cells&lt;/strong&gt; from a sequencing mixture (e.g, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.10xgenomics.com/&#34;&gt;10X Genomics&lt;/a&gt;). By using &lt;strong&gt;Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)&lt;/strong&gt; we can discover &lt;strong&gt;rare cell populations&lt;/strong&gt; and genes that are specifically acting in those. Potential is high and the list of publications growing daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are a scientist in a biotech exploring novel targets those might be a great source to &lt;strong&gt;gather specific information&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Seurat/index.html&#34;&gt;Seurat&lt;/a&gt; package is a great tool for digging into single cell datasets. It will open you access beyond what is in the publications. You can find many tutorials in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://satijalab.org/seurat/&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I will focus on a recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1164/rccm.201712-2410OC&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; which explored transcriptome of lung cells from Pulmonary fibrosis patients by scRNAseq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis&lt;/strong&gt; is a progressive scarring of the lung tissue leading to death within 3-4 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current therapies do not increase the survival&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many Biotech companies are developing &lt;strong&gt;novel drugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    What types of cells those drugs are acting on?
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did not get a clear elbow shape here, but after 10th principal component additional dimensions do not explain big amount of the variance. So we will use first 10 dimensions for the subsequent analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the table above I generated a cluster id vector to assign cell type to each cluster. I have a group NA which I could not assign a cell type, which is probably a technical artifact from cell cycle regression since the top genes expressed in this population are cell cycle related. I also found 3 subpopulations of macrophages and 2 types of mast cells in thiS patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What cells &lt;code&gt;Biotech&lt;/code&gt; Companies are targeting in lung fibrosis?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel therapies in pulmonary fibrosis are urgently needed. Let‚Äôs look at few promising drugs currently in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;fibrinogen&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fibrinogen&lt;/h4&gt;

Main source for the &lt;code&gt;CTGF&lt;/code&gt; production here seems the &lt;code&gt;Ciliated cells.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galapagos GLPG1690 has entered Phase 3 clinical trials and it targets Autotaxin (ENPP2).&lt;/p&gt;

We see a low expression of &lt;code&gt;ENPP&lt;/code&gt; mainly in Macrophages, Dendritic cells and Fibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other clinical candidate of Galapagos is GLPG1205 which targets GPR84. It has entered Phase 2 clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;VlnPlot(Fib, features =  c(&amp;quot;GPR84&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GPR84&lt;/code&gt; has very low expression throughout the lung cells of this patient. The gene is mainly expressed in Type 1 Macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FeaturePlot(Fib, features =c(&amp;quot;LPAR1&amp;quot;),  pt.size = 1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

It is expressed at low levels but consistently on many types of lung cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;roche-nintedanib&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Roche &lt;code&gt;nintedanib&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nintedanib is one of the two new medicines approved for IPF patients. It targets multiple receptor tyrosine kinase receptors such as VEGF, FGF and PDGF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;VlnPlot(Fib, features = c(&amp;quot;VEGFA&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;PDGFA&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-09-17-genomics-at-superresolution-advances-in-sequencing-technologies_files/figure-html/nintedanib-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FeaturePlot(Fib, features =  c(&amp;quot;VEGFA&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;PDGFA&amp;quot;), pt.size = 1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-09-17-genomics-at-superresolution-advances-in-sequencing-technologies_files/figure-html/nintedanib-2.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VEGFA, PDGFA is highly expressed in multiple types of cells in the lung microenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seurat package allowed us to cluster different types of lung cells so that we can visualize their specific gene expression. We used those plots to see which cells express the drug targets in clinical trials or in use.&lt;br /&gt;
Although changes associated with fibrosis are well defined the causal factors are not known. Reflecting this we saw that those &lt;strong&gt;drugs target many different components of the lung microenvironment.&lt;/strong&gt; The conquest is on and we hope promising therapies arrive soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Start blogging in 5 minutes on Netlify with Hugo and blogdown (September 2019 Update)</title>
      <link>/r/deploy-your-blog-in-5-minutes/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/r/deploy-your-blog-in-5-minutes/</guid>
      <description>


&lt;p&gt;This guide will help you to get your website online in a few minutes. Then, customize and add your own material in RStudio environment, push it to your Github repository and benefit from the continuous deployment feature of Netlify.
It took me many days of work, reading tens of blog posts, YouTube videos and a lot of testing to figure out all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an up to date workflow of &lt;strong&gt;how I created my Blog on Github and deployed at Netlify.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;tools-we-need&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tools we need;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RStudio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netlify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo is the actual website builder and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt; is an R package that allows us to use Hugo in R environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;on-rstudio-build-your-website-locally.&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;On RStudio: Build your website locally.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;File&lt;/strong&gt; menu&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;New Project -&amp;gt; New Directory -&amp;gt; Website using blogdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, to create a new site with the academic theme replace default lithium &lt;code&gt;Hugo theme&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;gcushen/hugo-academic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For other themes go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://themes.gohugo.io&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;http://themes.gohugo.io&lt;/a&gt;, choose a theme you like, click homepage and you will be redirected to its github repository.&lt;br /&gt;
Replace its &lt;strong&gt;repository name&lt;/strong&gt; with ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;gcushen/hugo-academic&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù above)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::serve_site()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;command will create the website and it should be visible on the viewer pane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;list.files()&lt;/strong&gt; to see the files/folders generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;prepare-for-github-compatibility&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Prepare for GitHub compatibility&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to publish the website on github we need to specify a &lt;strong&gt;docs&lt;/strong&gt; folder instead of the default public folder where the website is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open your &lt;strong&gt;config.toml&lt;/strong&gt; file under the Website folder, and add the lines; &lt;a id=&#34;editconfig&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;baseurl: &#34;https://yourusername.github.io/page/&#34;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;publishDir = &#34;docs&#34;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/configtoml.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;configtoml&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save the config file. This will rebuild the site and create the docs folder.
Now you can go back to your folder and delete the public directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;on-github-account&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;On Github account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;create-a-new-repository&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Create a new repository&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log in to your Github account and create a new repository.
Here I called it &lt;code&gt;page.&lt;/code&gt;
Then your remote repository will be at&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yourusername/page.git&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://github.com/yourusername/page.git&lt;/a&gt;
Copy that link.
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/git.png&#34; alt=&#34;git&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;on-git&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;On Git&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;create-your-local-.git-repository&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Create your local .git repository&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using pwd and cd commands navigate your directory to the Website folder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initialize your local repository&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Use the copied link from above&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/page.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git add .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git commit -m createmywebsite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following command will synchronize all your files to your Github repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push origin master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;publishing-your-website-on-github-pages&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Publishing your website on Github pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your Github repository. Go to settings&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll down to Github pages, choose source &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;master branch/docs&lt;/strong&gt; folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will update the page. Scroll down to Github pages again click the link:&lt;br /&gt;
e.g.¬†&lt;a href=&#34;https://yourusername.github.io/page/&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://yourusername.github.io/page/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hoorray! In this step your website should be up and running on Github!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;deploying-your-website-to-netlify&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deploying your Website to Netlify&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to benefit from the advantages like continous deployment you can
use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/&#34;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to your &lt;strong&gt;Netlify&lt;/strong&gt;, Click &lt;code&gt;Get started for free&lt;/code&gt; and sign up with Github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose &lt;strong&gt;New site from Git&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; at the bottom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on &lt;strong&gt;Configure the Netlify app on GitHub.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On github select your target repository. Save.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Netlify pick up that repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify Basic build settings: &lt;strong&gt;Publish directory&lt;/strong&gt; should be &lt;strong&gt;docs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on &lt;strong&gt;Show advanced&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; New Variable&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a New Variable&lt;br /&gt;
Modify as Key = HUGO_VERSION and Value = 0.58.1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This step is important otherwise your site will not be built.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you dont know your hugo version; on Rstudio &amp;gt; type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::hugo_version()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Deploy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will allocate you a random link. You have to go back to your config.toml and modify baseurl as we did for Github &lt;a href=&#34;#editconfig&#34;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt; but with this netlify link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this step you have to push changes to github from your local git. Similarly to the steps above without &lt;code&gt;git init&lt;/code&gt; this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netlify will detect those changes you pushed to your github repository and your site will be published in a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hoorray! In this step your website should be up and running on Netlify!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-to-use-your-own-domain-name&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to use your own domain name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;go-to-your-domain-provider-e.g-i-did-on-go-daddy&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Go to your domain provider e.g I did on Go Daddy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Products &amp;gt; Scroll down to your domain &amp;gt; Click DNS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create new or modify if existing an A record pointing your root domain to Netlify load balancer‚Äôs IP address 104.198.14.52 as in below;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/A_record.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A_record&#34; /&gt;Add a CNAME file as here;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/netlify_CNAME.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;netlify_CNAME&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;go-to-domain-settings-on-your-deploy-at-netlify&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Go to domain settings on your deploy at Netlify&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add custom domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill in your domain name&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Verify &amp;gt; Yes, add domain &amp;gt; Verify DNS configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voila, in this step your website should be online at www.yourdomain.com!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Kindle Highlights&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Kindle Notes For:
Thinking, Fast and Slow
Daniel Kahneman

Yellow highlight | Page: 3
Many of us spontaneously anticipate how friends and colleagues will evaluate our choices; the quality and content of these anticipated judgments therefore matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 5
we were far too willing to believe research findings based on inadequate evidence and prone to collect too few observations in our own research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 6
Amos was the more logical thinker, with an orientation to theory and an unfailing sense of direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 6
I was more intuitive and rooted in the psychology of perception, from which we borrowed many ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 7
Did it occur to you that there are more than 20 male farmers for each male librarian in the United States? Because there are so many more farmers, it is almost certain that more ‚Äúmeek and tidy‚Äù souls will be found on tractors than at library information desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 7
The reliance on the heuristic caused predictable biases (systematic errors) in their predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 7
We called this reliance on the ease of memory search the availability heuristic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 8
Our article challenged both assumptions without discussing them directly. We documented systematic errors in the thinking of normal people, and we traced these errors to the design of the machinery of cognition rather than to the corruption of thought by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 8
emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 8
People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory‚Äîand this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 12
When the question is difficult and a skilled solution is not available, intuition still has a shot: an answer may come to mind quickly‚Äîbut it is not an answer to the original question. The question that the executive faced (should I invest in Ford stock?) was difficult, but the answer to an easier and related question (do I like Ford cars?) came readily to his mind and determined his choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 12
This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 28
Our teacher took it for granted that the sympathy we would feel for the patient would not be under our control; it would arise from System 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 34
The Invisible Gorilla had&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 41
you would be more likely to select the tempting chocolate cake when your mind is loaded with digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 41
Another way of saying this is that controlling thoughts and behaviors is one of the tasks that System 2 performs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 42
ego depletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 46
Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 48
children‚Äôs ability to control their attention and their ability to control their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 48
judgment? Stanovich published his conclusions in a book titled Rationality and the Reflective Mind,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 51
The word evokes memories, which evoke emotions, which in turn evoke facial expressions and other reactions, such as a general tensing up and an avoidance tendency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 51
yielding a self-reinforcing pattern of cognitive, emotional, and physical responses that is both diverse and integrated‚Äîit has been called associatively coherent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 51
cognition is embodied; you think with your body, not only with your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 52
David Hume reduced the principles of association to three: resemblance, contiguity in time and place, and causality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 52
effects (virus cold); things to their properties (lime green); things to the categories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 52
exposure to a word causes immediate and measurable changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 52
We call this a priming effect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 53
your actions and your emotions can be primed by events of which you are not even aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 53
influencing of an action by the idea‚Äîis known as the ideomotor effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 54
if you were primed to think of old age, you would tend to act old, and acting old would reinforce the thought of old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 54
Reciprocal links are common in the associative network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 54
you are likely to be rewarded by actually feeling calm and kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 55
funding of schools was significantly greater when the polling station was in a school than when it was in a nearby location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 55
The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accept demands from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 57
But your subjective experience consists largely of the story that your System 2 tells itself about what is going on. Priming phenomena arise in System 1, and you have no conscious access to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 58
Evidently, a purely symbolic reminder of being watched prodded people into improved behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 58
Timothy Wilson wrote a book with the evocative title Strangers to Ourselves. You have now been introduced to that stranger in you, which may be in control of much of what you do, although you rarely have a glimpse of it. System 1 provides the impressions that often turn into your beliefs,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 58
‚ÄúHis System 1 constructed a story, and his System 2 believed it. It happens to all of us.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 58
‚ÄúI made myself smile and I‚Äôm actually feeling better!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 59
The surprise is that a single dial of cognitive ease is connected to a large network of diverse inputs and outputs. Figure 5 tells the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 60
‚ÄúBecoming Famous Overnight.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 61
greater cognitive ease in perceiving a word you have seen earlier, and it is this sense of ease that gives you the impression of familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 61
pointing one way or another. You knew soon after reading them that the first two statements are true and the last one is false. Note, however, that the statement ‚ÄúA chicken has three legs‚Äù is more obviously false than ‚ÄúA chicken has four legs.‚Äù Your associative machinery slows the judgment of the latter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 62
But there were questions where no good answer came to mind, where all I had to go by was cognitive ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 62
The impression of familiarity is produced by System 1, and System 2 relies on that impression for a true/false judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 62
A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 62
distinguished from truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 62
true. It is entirely legitimate for you to enlist cognitive ease to work in your favor,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 63
If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 63
complex language where simpler language will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 65
performance was better with the bad font. Cognitive strain, whatever its source, mobilizes System 2, which is more likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 66
it. Zajonc called it the mere exposure effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 67
Indeed, the mere exposure effect is actually stronger for stimuli that the individual never consciously sees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 67
The link between positive emotion and cognitive ease in System 1 has a long evolutionary history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 67
creativity is associative memory that works&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 67
exceptionally well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 69
Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1: when we are uncomfortable and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 69
when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 70
‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a very good mood today, and my System 2 is weaker than usual. I should be extra careful.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 73

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 142
An availability cascade is a self-sustaining chain of events, which may start from media reports of a relatively minor event and lead up to public panic and large-scale government action. On some occasions, a media story about a risk catches the attention of a segment of the public, which becomes aroused and worried. This emotional reaction becomes a story in itself, prompting additional coverage in the media, which in turn produces greater concern and involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

The large impact of 0 5% illustrates the possibility effect, which causes highly unlikely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 311
The improvement from 95% to 100% is another qualitative change that has a large impact, the certainty effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 312
Because of the possibility effect, we tend to overweight small risks and are willing to pay far more than expected value to eliminate them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 312
The conclusion is straightforward: the decision weights that people assign to outcomes are not identical to the probabilities of these outcomes, contrary to the expectation principle. Improbable outcomes are overweighted‚Äîthis is the possibility effect. Outcomes that are almost certain are underweighted relative to actual certainty. The expectation principle, by which values are weighted by their probability, is poor psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 312
there is a powerful argument that a decision maker who wishes to be rational must conform to the expectation principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 314
We retained utility theory as a logic of rational choice but abandoned the idea that people are perfectly rational choosers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 314
We took on the task of developing a psychological theory that would describe the choices people make, regardless of whether they are rational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 316
However, when an unlikely event becomes the focus of attention, we will assign it much more weight than its probability deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 316
people attach values to gains and losses rather than to wealth, and the decision weights that they assign to outcomes are different from probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 318
This is where people who face very bad options take desperate gambles, accepting a high probability of making things worse in exchange for a small hope of avoiding a large loss. Risk taking of this kind often turns manageable failures into disasters.&lt;/p&gt;

My current view of decision weights has been strongly influenced by recent research on the role of emotions and vividness in decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

Overweighting of unlikely outcomes is rooted in System 1 features that are familiar by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 324
Your judgment of probability was ultimately determined by the cognitive ease, or fluency, with which a plausible scenario came to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

You were asked to estimate the probability of the baby going home, but you almost certainly focused on the events that might cause a baby not to be released within the normal period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 324
Our mind has a useful capability to focus spontaneously on whatever is odd, different, or unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 324
The unlikely event became focal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 325
The probability of a rare event is most likely to be overestimated when the alternative is not fully specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 325
The absurdity disappeared when the same judges were asked whether the winner would be from the Eastern or the Western conference. The focal event and its alternative were equally specific in that question and the judgments of their probabilities added up to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

The power of format creates opportunities for manipulation, which people with an axe to grind know how to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

Broad framing was obviously superior in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúI would like all of them to accept their risks.‚Äù In the context of that conversation, it was natural for the CEO to adopt a broad frame that encompassed all 25 bets. Like Sam facing 100 coin tosses, he could count on statistical aggregation to mitigate the overall risk.&lt;/p&gt;

account, when better investments are available, is known as the sunk-cost fallacy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 345
All too often a company afflicted by sunk costs drives into the blizzard, throwing good money after bad rather than accepting the humiliation of closing the account of a costly failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 346
In the presence of sunk costs, the manager‚Äôs incentives are misaligned with the objectives of the firm and its shareholders,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 346
Boards of directors are well aware of these conflicts and often replace a CEO who is encumbered by prior decisions and reluctant to cut losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 346
The sunk-cost fallacy keeps people for too long in poor jobs, unhappy marriages, and unpromising research projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 346
Regret is one of the counterfactual emotions that are triggered by the availability of alternatives to reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 347
Regret and blame are both evoked by a comparison to a norm, but the relevant norms are different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 347
Decision makers know that they are prone to regret, and the anticipation of that painful emotion plays a part in many decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 348
people expect to have stronger emotional reactions (including regret) to an outcome that is produced by action than to the same outcome when it is produced by inaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 349
success is generally a more normal outcome than is failure.&lt;/p&gt;

Richard Thaler‚Äôs early classic on consumer behavior included a compelling example, slightly modified in the following question:&lt;/p&gt;

The discrepancy between single and joint evaluation of the burglary scenario belongs to a broad family of reversals of judgment and choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 355
As in the burglary scenarios, the preference reversal occurs because joint evaluation focuses attention on an aspect of the situation‚Äîthe fact that bet A is much less safe than bet B‚Äîwhich was less salient in single evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 356
phenomenon that Lichtenstein and Slovic had described. This was probably the first finding by experimental psychologists that ever attracted the attention of economists. The introductory paragraph of Grether and Plott‚Äôs article was unusually dramatic for a scholarly paper, and their intent was clear: ‚ÄúA body of data and theory has been developing within psychology which should be of interest to economists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 359
The narrow framing of single evaluation allowed dolphins to have a higher intensity score, leading to a high rate of contributions by intensity matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 359
the ‚Äúhuman vs.¬†animal‚Äù feature becomes salient only when the two are seen together. In joint evaluation people show a solid preference for the farmworkers and a willingness to contribute substantially more to their welfare than to the protection of a likable non-human species.&lt;/p&gt;

This is how Econs understand things. Their beliefs and preferences are reality-bound. In particular, the objects of their choices are states of the world, which are not affected by the words chosen to describe them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 363
The fact that logically equivalent statements evoke different reactions makes it impossible for Humans to be as reliably rational as Econs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 367
most of us passively accept decision problems as they are framed and therefore rarely have an opportunity to discover the extent to which our preferences are frame-bound rather than reality-bound.&lt;/p&gt;

He told of listening raptly to a long symphony on a disc that was scratched near the end, producing a shocking sound, and he reported that the bad ending ‚Äúruined the whole experience.‚Äù But the experience was not actually ruined, only the memory of it. The experiencing self had had an experience that was almost entirely good, and the bad end could not undo it, because it had already happened. My questioner had assigned the entire episode a failing grade because it had ended very badly, but that grade effectively ignored 40 minutes of musical bliss. Does the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 381
Confusing experience with the memory of it is a compelling cognitive illusion‚Äîand it is the substitution that makes us believe a past experience can be ruined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 381
What we learn from the past is to maximize the qualities of our future memories, not necessarily of our future experience. This is the tyranny of the remembering self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 383
The cold-hand experiment, like my old injections puzzle, revealed a discrepancy between decision utility and experienced utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 383
System 1 represents sets by averages, norms, and prototypes, not by sums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 385
Tastes and decisions are shaped by memories, and the memories can be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 389
As in the cold-hand experiment, right or wrong, people choose by memory when they decide whether or not to repeat an experience.&lt;/p&gt;

Others share my feeling, which is that I feel pity for my suffering self but not more than I would feel for a stranger in pain. Odd as it may seem, I am my remembering self, and the experiencing self, who does my living, is like a stranger to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 392
The resistance to interruption was a sign I had been having a good time, both with my toys and with the swings. I proposed to measure&lt;/p&gt;

Life satisfaction is not a flawed measure of their experienced well-being, as I thought some years ago. It is something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 397
‚ÄúThe easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 397
‚ÄúBeyond the satiation level of income, you can buy more pleasurable experiences, but you will lose some of your ability to enjoy the less expensive ones.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

goals‚Äîone recipe for a dissatisfied adulthood is setting goals that are especially difficult to attain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 402
In part because of these findings I have changed my mind about the definition of well-being. The goals that people set for themselves are so important to what they do and how they feel about it that an exclusive focus on experienced well-being is not tenable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 402
We can infer from the speed with which people respond to questions about their life, and from the effects of current mood on their responses, that they do not engage in a careful examination when they evaluate their life. They must be using heuristics, which are examples of both substitution and WYSIATI. Although their view of their life was influenced by a question about dating or by a coin on the copying machine, the participants in these studies did not forget that there is more to life than dating or feeling lucky. The concept of happiness is not suddenly changed by finding a dime, but System 1 readily&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 402
Any aspect of life to which attention is directed will loom large in a global evaluation. This is the essence of the focusing illusion, which can be described in a single sentence:Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

For behavioral economists, however, freedom has a cost, which is borne by individuals who make bad choices, and by a society that feels obligated to help them.&lt;/p&gt;

and Sunstein call it choice architecture‚Äîhas a huge effect on the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 413
The default option is naturally perceived as the normal choice. Deviating from the normal choice is an act of commission, which requires more effortful deliberation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 417
Its operative features, which include WYSIATI, intensity matching, and associative coherence, among others, give rise to predictable biases and to cognitive illusions such as anchoring, nonregressive predictions, overconfidence, and numerous others.&lt;/p&gt;

Observers are less cognitively busy and more open to information than actors.&lt;/p&gt;

Organizations are better than individuals when it comes to avoiding errors, because they naturally think more slowly and have the power to impose orderly procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

This finding tells me that it is not when we have a strong feeling of recognized personal accomplishment that we will seek to bask in reflected glory. Instead, it will be when prestige (both public and private) is low that we will be intent upon using the successes of associated others to help restore image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 154
By concentrating our attention on the effect rather than the causes, we can avoid the laborious, nearly impossible task of trying to detect and deflect the many psychological influences on liking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 183
In this case, because we know that the things that are difficult to possess are typically better than those that are easy to possess, we can often use an item‚Äôs availability to help us quickly and correctly decide on its quality.&lt;/p&gt;

Aside from containing what may be my favorite ad-lib, the above dialogue illustrates a fundamental theme of this book: Very often in making a decision about someone or something, we don‚Äôt use all the relevant available information; we use, instead, only a single, highly representative piece of the total. And an isolated piece of information,&lt;/p&gt;

There are all kinds of writers and all kinds of methods, and any method that helps you to say what you want to say is the right method for you. Some people write by day, others by night. Some people need silence, others turn on the radio. Some write by hand, some by computer, some by talking into a tape recorder. Some people write their first draft in one long burst and then revise; others can‚Äôt write the second paragraph until they have fiddled endlessly with the first.&lt;/p&gt;

Ultimately the product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is. I often find myself reading with interest about a topic I never thought would interest me‚Äîsome scientific quest, perhaps. What holds me is the enthusiasm of the writer for his field. How was he drawn into it? What emotional baggage did he bring along? How did it change his life? It‚Äôs not necessary to want to spend a year alone at Walden Pond to become involved with a writer who did.&lt;/p&gt;

Reexamine each sentence you put on paper. Is every word doing new work? Can any thought be expressed with more economy? Is anything pompous or pretentious or faddish?&lt;/p&gt;

Readers want the person who is talking to them to sound genuine. Therefore a fundamental rule is: be yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 338
Assume that you are the writer sitting down to write. You think your article must be of a certain length or it won‚Äôt seem important. You think how august it will look in print. You think of all the people who will read it. You think that it must have the solid weight of authority. You think that its style must dazzle. No wonder you tighten; you are so busy thinking of your awesome responsibility to the finished article that you can‚Äôt even start. Yet you vow to be worthy of the task, and, casting about for grand phrases that wouldn‚Äôt occur to you if you weren‚Äôt trying so hard to make an impression, you plunge in.&lt;/p&gt;

Sell yourself, and your subject will exert its own appeal. Believe in your own identity and your own opinions. Writing is an act of ego, and you might as well admit it. Use its energy to keep yourself going.&lt;/p&gt;

Think of the other as a creative act: the expressing of who you are. Relax and say what you want to say. And since style is who you are, you only need to be true to yourself to find it gradually emerging from under the accumulated clutter and debris, growing more distinctive every day.&lt;/p&gt;

Never say anything in writing that you wouldn‚Äôt comfortably say in conversation. If you‚Äôre not a person who says ‚Äúindeed‚Äù or ‚Äúmoreover,‚Äù or who calls someone an individual (‚Äúhe‚Äôs a fine individual‚Äù), please don‚Äôt write it.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a kind of writing that might be called journalese, and it‚Äôs the death of freshness in anybody‚Äôs style. It‚Äôs the common currency of newspapers and of magazines like People‚Äîa mixture of cheap words, made-up words and clich√©s that have become so pervasive that a writer can hardly help using them. You must fight these phrases or you‚Äôll sound like every hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 512
What is ‚Äújournalese‚Äù? It‚Äôs a quilt of instant words patched together out of other parts of speech. Adjectives are used as nouns (‚Äúgreats,‚Äù ‚Äúnotables‚Äù). Nouns are used as verbs (‚Äúto host‚Äù), or they are chopped off to form verbs (‚Äúenthuse,‚Äù ‚Äúemote‚Äù), or they are padded to form verbs (‚Äúbeef up,‚Äù ‚Äúput teeth into‚Äù). This is a world where eminent people are ‚Äúfamed‚Äù and their associates are ‚Äústaffers,‚Äù where the future is always ‚Äúupcoming‚Äù and someone is forever ‚Äúfiring off‚Äù a note.&lt;/p&gt;

Make a habit of reading what is being written today and what was written by earlier masters. Writing is learned by imitation. If anyone asked me how I learned to write, I‚Äôd say I learned by reading the men and women who were doing the kind of writing I wanted to do and trying to figure out how they did it. But cultivate the best models. Don‚Äôt assume that because an article is in a newspaper or a magazine it must be good.&lt;/p&gt;

You‚Äôll find ruffians and riffraff, miscreants and malefactors, reprobates and rapscallions, hooligans and hoodlums, scamps and scapegraces, scoundrels and scalawags, jezebels and jades. You‚Äôll find adjectives to fit them all (foul and fiendish, devilish and diabolical), and adverbs and verbs to describe how the wrongdoers do their wrong, and cross-references leading to still other thickets of venality and vice. Still, there‚Äôs no better friend to have around to nudge the memory than Roget. It saves you the time of rummaging in your brain‚Äîthat network of overloaded grooves‚Äîto find the word that‚Äôs right on the tip of your tongue, where it doesn‚Äôt do you any good.

I try to surmise how in rewriting the sentence he reassembled it to end with a phrase that will momentarily linger, or how he chose one word over another because he was after a certain emotional weight.

You learn to write by writing. It‚Äôs a truism, but what makes it a truism is that it‚Äôs true. The only way to learn to write is to force yourself to produce a certain number of words on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

If you went to work for a newspaper that required you to write two or three articles every day, you would be a better writer after six months. You wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be writing well; your style might still be full of clutter and clich√©s. But you would be exercising your powers of putting the English language on paper, gaining confidence and identifying the most common problems.&lt;/p&gt;

All writing is ultimately a question of solving a problem. It may be a problem of where to obtain the facts or how to organize the material. It may be a problem of approach or attitude, tone or style. Whatever it is, it has to be confronted and solved. Sometimes you will despair of finding the right solution‚Äîor any solution. You‚Äôll think, ‚ÄúIf I live to be ninety I‚Äôll never get out of this mess.‚Äù I‚Äôve often thought it myself.

Unity is the anchor of good writing. So, first, get your unities straight. Unity not only keeps the reader from straggling off in all directions; it satisfies your readers‚Äô subconscious need for order and reassures them that all is well at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;

One choice is unity of pronoun. Are you going to write in the first person,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 727

Instead of controlling his material, his material is controlling him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 751
Therefore ask yourself some basic questions before you start. For example: ‚ÄúIn what capacity am I going to address the reader?‚Äù (Reporter? Provider of information? Average man or woman?) ‚ÄúWhat pronoun and tense am I going to use?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat style?‚Äù (Impersonal reportorial? Personal but formal? Personal and casual?) ‚ÄúWhat attitude am I going to take toward the material?‚Äù (Involved? Detached? Judgmental? Ironic? Amused?) ‚ÄúHow much do I want to cover?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat one point do I want to make?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

How long should the lead be? One or two paragraphs? Four or five?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 790
Your lead may not be the best of all possible leads, but if it does the job it‚Äôs supposed to do, be thankful and proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

Readers want to know‚Äîvery soon‚Äîwhat‚Äôs in it for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 795
Therefore your lead must capture the reader immediately and force him to keep reading. It must cajole him with freshness, or novelty, or paradox, or humor, or surprise, or with an unusual idea, or an interesting fact, or a question. Anything will do, as long as it nudges his curiosity and tugs at his sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 797
Next the lead must do some real work. It must provide hard details that tell the reader why the piece was written and why he ought to read it. But don‚Äôt dwell on the reason. Coax the reader a little more; keep him inquisitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 800
But take special care with the last sentence of each paragraph‚Äîit‚Äôs the crucial springboard to the next paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 929
Those are some suggestions on how to get started. Now I want to tell you how to stop. Knowing when to end an article is far more important than most writers realize. You should give as much thought to choosing your last sentence as you did to your first. Well, almost as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time really smart people were completely convinced the world was flat. Then they learned that it wasn‚Äôt. But they were still pretty sure the sun revolved around the Earth¬†‚Ä¶¬†until that theory went bust, too. For an even longer period of time, smart people have believed story is just a form of entertainment. They‚Äôve thought that beyond the immense pleasure it bestows‚Äîthe ephemeral joy and deep sense of satisfaction a good story leaves us with‚Äîstory itself serves no necessary purpose. Sure, our lives from time immemorial would have been far drabber without it, but we‚Äôd have survived just fine. Wrong again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 1
Story, as it turns out, was crucial to our evolution‚Äîmore so than opposable thumbs. Opposable thumbs let us hang on; story told us what to hang on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 1
Story is what enabled us to imagine what might happen in the future, and so prepare for it‚Äîa feat no other species can lay claim to, opposable thumbs or not.1 Story is what makes us human, not just metaphorically but literally. Recent breakthroughs in neuroscience reveal that our brain is hardwired to respond to story; the pleasure we derive from a tale well told is nature‚Äôs way of seducing us into paying attention to it.2&lt;/p&gt;

reveal subtle universal truths that just might alter their entire perception of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 3
there is an implicit framework that must underlie a story in order for that passion, that fire, to ignite the reader‚Äôs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 3
Why do writers often have trouble embracing the notion that there is more to creating a story than having a good idea and a way with words? Because the ease with which we surrender to the stories we read tends to cloud our understanding of stories we write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 4
Evolution dictates that the first job of any good story is to completely anesthetize the part of our brain that questions how it is creating such a compelling illusion of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 4
So it‚Äôs no surprise that we tend to be utterly oblivious to the fact that beneath every captivating story, there is an intricate mesh of interconnected elements holding it together, allowing it to build with seemingly effortless precision. This often fools us into thinking we know exactly what has us hooked‚Äîthings like beautiful metaphors, authentic-sounding dialogue, an interesting character‚Äîwhen, in fact, despite how engaging those things appear to be in and of themselves, it turns out they‚Äôre secondary. What has us hooked is something else altogether, something that underlies them, secretly bringing them to life: story, as our brain understands it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 6
It‚Äôs simple. Your brain, along with every other living organism down to the humble amoeba, has one main goal: survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 6
Your subconscious brain‚Äîwhich neuroscientists refer to as the adaptive or cognitive unconscious‚Äîis a finely tuned instrument, instantly aware of what matters, what doesn‚Äôt, why, and, hopefully, what you should do about it.2 It knows you don‚Äôt have the time to think,&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúGee, what‚Äôs that loud noise? Oh, it‚Äôs a horn honking; it must be coming from that great big SUV that‚Äôs barreling straight at me. The driver was probably texting and didn‚Äôt notice me until it was too late to stop. Maybe I should get out of the‚Äî‚Äù Splat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 8
Our brain developed a way to consciously navigate information so that, provided we have the time, we can decide on our own what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 8
Story. Here‚Äôs how neuroscientist Antonio Damasio sums it up: ‚ÄúThe problem of how to make all this wisdom understandable, transmissible, persuasive, enforceable‚Äîin a word, of how to make it stick‚Äîwas faced and a solution found. Storytelling was the solution‚Äîstorytelling is something brains do, naturally and implicitly.‚Ä¶ [I]t should be no surprise that it pervades the entire fabric of human societies and cultures.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 8
We think in story. It‚Äôs hardwired in our brain. It‚Äôs how we make strategic sense of the otherwise overwhelming world around us. Simply put, the brain constantly seeks meaning from all the input thrown at it, yanks out what‚Äôs important for our survival on a need-to-know basis, and tells us a story about it, based on what it knows of our past experience with it, how we feel about it, and how it might affect us. Rather than recording everything on a first come, first served basis, our brain casts us as ‚Äúthe protagonist‚Äù and then edits our experience with cinema-like precision, creating logical interrelations, mapping connections between memories, ideas, and events for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 8
Story is the language of experience,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 9
Story evolved as a way to explore our own mind and the minds of others, as a sort of dress rehearsal for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 9
As a result, story helps us survive not only in the life-and-death physical sense but also in a life-well-lived social sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 9
Fictional narratives supply us with a mental catalogue of the fatal conundrums we might face someday and the outcomes of strategies we could deploy in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 10
Not only do we crave story, but we have very specific hardwired expectations for every story we read,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:Story‚Äôs ability to help us safely navigate in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 10
The real answer is rather counterintuitive: our expectations have everything to do with the story‚Äôs ability to provide information on how we might safely navigate this earthly plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 10
When a story meets our brain‚Äôs criteria, we relax and slip into the protagonist‚Äôs skin, eager to experience what his or her struggle feels like, without having to leave the comfort of home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 11
So what is a story? A story is how what happens affects someone who is trying to achieve what turns out to be a difficult goal, and how he or she changes as a result. Breaking it down in the soothingly familiar parlance of the writing world, this translates to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:What is a story&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 11
The ‚Äúgoal‚Äù is what‚Äôs known as the story question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 11
As counterintuitive as it may sound, a story is not about the plot or even what happens in it. Stories are about how we, rather than the world around us, change. They grab us only when they allow us to experience how it would feel to navigate the plot. Thus story, as we‚Äôll see throughout, is an internal journey, not an external one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:***** how we change is what matters in the story&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 12
All the elements of a story are anchored in this very simple premise, and they work in unison to create what appears to the reader as reality, only sharper, clearer, and far more entertaining, because stories do what our cognitive unconscious does: filter out everything that would distract us from the situation at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 12
Let‚Äôs face it, we‚Äôre all busy. Plus, most of us are plagued by that little voice in the back of our head constantly reminding us of what we really should be doing right now instead of whatever it is we‚Äôre actually doing‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;

the sense that something is about to change (and not necessarily for the better).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 13
As neuroscience reveals, what draws us into a story and keeps us there is the firing of our dopamine neurons, signaling that intriguing information is on its way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 14
As readers we eagerly probe each piece of information for significance, constantly wondering, ‚ÄúWhat is this meant to tell me?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 14
We are always looking for the why beneath what‚Äôs happening on the surface. Not only because our survival might depend on it, but because it‚Äôs exhilarating. It makes us feel something‚Äînamely, curiosity. Having our curiosity piqued is visceral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 14
the anticipation of knowledge we‚Äôre now hungry for, a sensation caused by that pleasurable rush of dopamine. Because being curious is necessary for survival (What‚Äôs that rustling in the bushes?), nature encourages it. And what better way to encourage curiosity than to make it feel good? This is why, once your curiosity is roused as a reader, you have an emotional, vested interest in finding out what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:what is necessary for surviva: list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 15
bingo! You feel that delicious sense of urgency (hello dopamine!) that all good stories instantly ignite.&lt;/p&gt;

be. After all, unless something is already happening, how can we want to know what happens next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 23
marketers, politicians, and televangelists know more about story than most writers. This is because, by definition, they start with something writers often never even think about‚Äîthe point their story will make.&lt;/p&gt;

Armed with that knowledge, they then craft a tale in which every word, every image, every nuance leads directly to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 25
Thus your first job is to zero in on the point your story is making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 25
A story is designed, from beginning to end, to answer a single overarching question. As readers we instinctively know this, so we expect every word, every line, every character, every image, every action to move us closer to the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 26
As one editor put it, ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt summarize your book in a few sentences, rewrite the book until you can.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 26
We have no idea who the protagonist is, so we have no way to gauge the relevance or meaning of anything that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 26
We know who the protagonist is, but she doesn‚Äôt seem to have a goal, so we&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 26
don‚Äôt know what the point is or where the story is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 26
We know what the protagonist‚Äôs goal is, but have no clue what inner issue it forces him to deal with, so everything feels superficial and rather dull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 26
We know who the protagonist is and what both her goal and her issue are, but suddenly she gets what she wants, arbitrarily changes her mind, or gets hit by a bus, and now someone else seems to be the main character. ¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢ We‚Äôre aware of the protagonist‚Äôs goal, but what happens doesn‚Äôt seem to affect him or whether he achieves it. ¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢ The things that happen don‚Äôt affect the protagonist in a believable way (if at all), so not only doesn‚Äôt she seem like a real person, but we have no idea why she does what she does, which makes it impossible to anticipate what she‚Äôll do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 27
What was missing in all those failed manuscripts is focus. Without it, the reader has no way to gauge the meaning of anything, and since we‚Äôre wired to hunt for meaning in everything‚Äîwell, you do the math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 27
The story isn‚Äôt about whether or not the protagonist achieves her goal per se; it‚Äôs about what she has to overcome internally to do it. This is what drives the story forward. I call it the protagonist‚Äôs issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 27
The second element, the theme, is what your story says about human nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 27
Theme tends to be reflected in how your characters treat each other, so it defines what is possible and what isn‚Äôt in the world the story unfolds in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 28
The third element is the plot itself‚Äîthe events that relentlessly force the protagonist to deal with her issue as she pursues her goal, no matter how many times she tries to make an end run around her issue along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 28
‚Äúminds exist to predict what will happen next.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 28
We love to figure things out and we don‚Äôt like being confused.&lt;/p&gt;

a concrete frame of reference against which everything that happens is measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:how brain works&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 29
All of these contents are inextricably tied to a singular reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 29
What does the story tell us about what it means to be human? ¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢ What does it say about how humans react to circumstances beyond their control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 30
But the real secret to theme is that it‚Äôs not general; that is, the theme wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúlove‚Äù per se‚Äîrather, it would be a very specific point you‚Äôre making about love. For instance, a love story can be sweet and lyrical, revealing that people are good eggs after all; it can be hard-nosed and edgy, revealing that people are intense and quirky; it can be cynical and manipulative, revealing that people are best avoided, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 30
Knowing the theme of your story in advance helps, because it gives you a gauge by which to measure your characters‚Äô responses to the situations they find themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 30
As corporate consultants Richard Maxwell and Robert Dickman say in their book The Elements of Persuasion, ‚ÄúFor those of us whose business depends on being able to persuade others‚Äîwhich is all of us in business‚Äîthe key to survival is being able to cut through all the clutter and make the sale. The good news is that the secret of selling is what it has always been‚Äîa good story.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 31
Knowing your story‚Äôs point is what helps you cut through all the clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 31
the instant a reader opens your book, his cognitive unconscious is hunting for a way to make life a little easier, see things a little clearer, understand people a bit better.9 So why not take a second to ask yourself, What is it I want my readers to walk away thinking about? What point does my story make? How do I want to change the way my reader sees the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 33
Thus we have a bird‚Äôs-eye view of the battle between the protagonist and the plot,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 34
She was glad she had never left Henry. She‚Äôd never had a friend as loyal, as kind, as her husband. And yet, standing behind her son, waiting for the traffic light to change, she remembered how in the midst of it all there had been times when she‚Äôd felt a loneliness so deep that once, not so many years ago, having a cavity filled, the dentist‚Äôs gentle turning of her chin with his soft fingers had felt to her like a tender kindness of almost excruciating depth, and she had swallowed with a groan of longing, tears springing to her eyes.11 In that very specific memory‚Äîthe dentist‚Äôs fleeting, workaday touch‚Äîan otherwise ineffable feeling of existential loneliness is made manifest, as palpable as if it had happened to us‚Äîbecause, as we‚Äôll see in chapter 4, as far as our brain is concerned, it actually has. By filtering her story through the thematic lens of loss and human endurance, Strout was able to pluck an otherwise random moment from Olive‚Äôs life and use it to give us insight into how Olive sees the world, and at the same time provide a visceral glimpse of the cost of being human.&lt;/p&gt;

Theme and Tone: It‚Äôs Not What You Say but How You Say It&lt;/p&gt;

Unchecked, theme is a bully, a know-it-all. And no one likes to be told what to do, which is why reverse psychology works so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 35
What this means is that the more passionate you are about making your point, the more you have to trust your story to convey it. As Evelyn Waugh says, ‚ÄúAll literature implies moral standards and criticisms, the less explicit the better.‚Äù12&lt;/p&gt;

What keeps us reading is the knowledge that Scarlett‚Äôs headstrong will, her guts, her nerve‚Äîher gumption‚Äîis stronger than her need to conform to society‚Äôs dictates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 37
Good question. Here‚Äôs the litmus test: the central theme must provide a point of view precise enough to give us specific insight into the protagonist and her internal issue, yet be broad enough to take into account everything that happens (again: the plot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 39
is it possible to filter the story‚Äôs other themes through it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 39
In Gone with the Wind, Scarlett‚Äôs gumption came first, so‚Äîfor better or worse‚Äîit affects everything else: her love life, her refusal to be constrained by the mores of the day, and her insatiable need to take action when she doesn‚Äôt get what she wants. Take action? Ah yes, the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 39
As we know, it‚Äôs the plot that puts the protagonist through his paces, presenting increasingly difficult obstacles that must be overcome if he‚Äôs to get within grabbing distance of the brass ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 39
But the plot‚Äôs goal isn‚Äôt simply to find out whether he snags that brass ring or not; rather, it‚Äôs to force him to confront the internal issue that‚Äôs keeping him from it in the first place. This issue is sometimes called the protagonist‚Äôs ‚Äúfatal flaw,‚Äù and whether a deep-rooted fear, a stubborn misperception, or a dubious character trait, it‚Äôs what he‚Äôs been battling throughout and what he must finally overcome to have a clear shot at the last remaining obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 39
Ironically, once he overcomes it, he often realizes true success is vastly different from what, up to that very second, he thought it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 40
What does Scarlett need in order to feel she‚Äôs survived what life has thrown at her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 40
The answer is her family‚Äôs plantation, Tara. Meaning, land. As her father tells her early on, ‚ÄúLand is the only thing in the world that amounts to anything.‚Ä¶‚Äù Land is what ties you to your past and makes you who you are. Without it, you are nothing. This becomes Scarlett‚Äôs benchmark, the thing that she‚Äôs sure will prove she‚Äôs survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 41
Readers are a surprisingly accepting lot when it comes to willfully blind protagonists, provided they understand the reason for their blindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 42
Knowing what the focus of your story is allows you to do for your story what your cognitive unconscious does for you: filter out everything extraneous, everything that doesn‚Äôt matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 43
Do you know what the point of your story is? What do you want people to walk away thinking about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 43
How do you want to change how they see the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 43
Do you know what your story says about human nature?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 43
Stories are our way of making sense of the world, so each and every one tells us something about what it means to be human, whether the author does it on purpose or not. What is your story saying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 44
Do the protagonist‚Äôs inner issue, the theme, and the plot work together to answer the story question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 44
Is my theme reflected in the way the world treats my protagonist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 44
Remember, the story question will always be in the back of your reader‚Äôs mind, and it is the responsibility of each theme-laced event to keep it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 44
Can you sum up what your story is about in a short paragraph?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 46
Turns out, as cognitive scientist Steven Pinker notes, ‚ÄúEmotions are mechanisms that set the brain‚Äôs highest-level goals.‚Äù3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 47
I saw the world through Linda Seton‚Äôs eyes. It was visceral, and it felt like a gift‚Äîbecause my worldview had shifted.&lt;/p&gt;

They had mistaken the story for what happens in it. But as we‚Äôve learned, the real story is how what happens affects the protagonist, and what she does as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 47
And guess what? Neutrality bores the reader. If it‚Äôs neutral, it‚Äôs not only beside the point, it detracts from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 47
protagonist must react in a way the reader can see and understand in the moment. This reaction must be specific, personal, and have an effect on whether the protagonist achieves her goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 47
everything we experience is automatically coated in emotion. Why? It‚Äôs our version of a computer‚Äôs ones and zeros, and it‚Äôs based on a single question: Will it hurt me, or will it help me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 47
This humble equation underlies every aspect of our rich, elegant, complex, and ever-changing sense of self, and how we experience the world around us. According to Damasio, ‚ÄúNo set of conscious images of any kind on any topic ever fails to be accompanied by an obedient choir of emotions and consequent feelings.‚Äù5 If we‚Äôre not feeling, we‚Äôre not breathing. A neutral protagonist is an automaton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 48
It is the protagonist‚Äôs story, after all, so we evaluate everyone and everything else based on how they affect him. Because ultimately what moves a story forward are the protagonist‚Äôs actions, reactions, and decisions, rather than the external events that trigger them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 49
This is what gives narrative story its unique power. What sets prose apart from plays, movies, and life itself is that it provides direct access to the most alluring and otherwise inaccessible realm imaginable: someone else‚Äôs mind.&lt;/p&gt;

To sum up, when writing in the first person, it helps to keep these things in mind: ¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢ Every word the narrator says must in some way reflect his point of view. ¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢ The narrator never mentions anything that doesn‚Äôt affect him in some way. ¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢ The narrator draws a conclusion about everything he mentions. ¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢ The narrator is never neutral; he always has an agenda. ¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢ The narrator can never tell us what anyone else is thinking or feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

Make us feel, and believe me, we‚Äôll know who‚Äôs right and who‚Äôs probably not. Tell us what to feel, on the other hand, and what we‚Äôll feel is bullied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 60
The reader‚Äôs goal is to experience the story on her own terms, not to have it explained to her or be herded toward a specific hard-and-fast conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 62
‚ÄúEvery author in some way portrays himself in his works, even if it be against his will.‚Äù14 Which means it might be time to reexamine that old stalwart: ‚ÄúWrite what you know.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 62
This tendency drives what communication scholars Chip and Dan Heath have dubbed ‚Äúthe Curse of Knowledge.‚Äù They explain, ‚ÄúOnce we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has ‚Äòcursed‚Äô us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others, because we can‚Äôt readily re-create our listeners‚Äô state of mind.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 63
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs always helpful to have Mark Twain‚Äôs pithy observation close at hand: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no wonder that truth is stranger than fiction. Fiction has to make sense.‚Äù17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 63
Donald Windham so astutely says, ‚ÄúI disagree with the advice ‚Äòwrite about what you know.‚Äô Write about what you need to know, in an effort to understand.‚Äù18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 65
‚Äúagenda‚Äù often carries a negative connotation, implying something decidedly Machiavellian, as in duplicitous, manipulative, and cunning. Truth is, agenda is just another word for goal‚Äîmaking it completely neutral and utterly necessary to survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 65
In fact, Steven Pinker defines intelligent life as ‚Äúusing knowledge of how things work to attain goals in the face of obstacles.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 65
the most common obstacle in both life and story is figuring out what other people really mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 67
Mirror neurons allow us to feel what others experience almost as if it were happening to us, the better to infer what ‚Äúothers know in order to explain their desires and intentions with real precision.‚Äù4 But here‚Äôs the kicker. We don‚Äôt just mirror other people. We mirror fictional characters too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 67
Pinker is quick to point out, without a goal, everything is meaningless.6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 68
None other than former president Dwight D. Eisenhower perfectly captures the essence of a successful story: ‚ÄúWe succeed only as we identify in life, or in war, or in anything else a single overriding objective, and make all other considerations bend to that one objective.‚Äù7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 68
her internal issue‚Äîthe thing she struggles with that keeps her from easily achieving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 68
As we‚Äôll see throughout, this internal struggle is what the reader came for, whether he‚Äôs conscious of it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 69
If you don‚Äôt provide your protagonist with a driving deep-seated need that he believes his quest will fulfill, the things that happen will feel random; they won‚Äôt add up to anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 69
maybe? If you don‚Äôt know what the objective is, everything appears random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 69
The action doesn‚Äôt add up, so there‚Äôs nothing to follow, which makes it impossible to anticipate what will happen next. It is anticipation that creates the intoxicating sense of momentum that hooks a reader, so stories without it remain unread.&lt;/p&gt;

what we‚Äôve learned from neuroscience: the brain is built to think socially. It‚Äôs not what happens externally that motivates George; it‚Äôs the responsibility he feels toward others, and how he sees himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 73
Proust observed, ‚ÄúThe only true voyage of discovery¬†‚Ä¶¬†would be not to visit strange lands but to possess [new] eyes.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 73
And in so doing, he makes a discovery often made by protagonists: his external goal and his internal goal were at odds all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 74
In It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life, George‚Äôs internal goal is to make a big difference in the world. His external goal is to get out of Bedford Falls and build bridges, skyscrapers, and to ‚Äúdo big things.‚Äù He believes these goals are one and the same. The movie then chronicles how his external goal is thwarted at every turn, and instead of doing big things, he always does the right thing. In the end, that‚Äôs precisely how he achieves his internal goal‚Äîmaking a big difference in many people‚Äôs lives‚Äîwhich brings with it the realization that he actually achieved his external goal as well. He did do big things‚Äîthings that are far more important and enduring than building skyscrapers. Thus, by achieving his internal goal, he was able to redefine his external goal‚Äîand, happily, discover that he‚Äôd already accomplished it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 74
But up to that moment, George fully believed that only by achieving his external goal would his internal goal be met. And as real life makes all too clear, this is rarely the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 75
By defining your protagonist‚Äôs internal and external goals, and then pitting them against each other, you can often ignite the kind of external tension and internal conflict capable of driving an entire narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 75
internal obstacles‚Äîusually in the form of longstanding emotional and psychological barriers‚Äîthat are forever holding her back. This, then, is her internal issue. We‚Äôre talking about the fear that whispers, What the hell do you think you‚Äôre doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 76
Adding External Problems Adds Drama Only If They‚Äôre Something the Protagonist Must Confront to Overcome Her Issue The myth that external problems add drama has plagued writers from time immemorial and has been inadvertently perpetuated by the myriad versions of the ‚Äúhero‚Äôs journey‚Äù story-structure model, which mandates that certain external events must happen at certain specific points in a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 77
crafting protagonists whose internal progress depends on said events occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Such stories are written from the outside in: the writers throw dramatic obstacles in their protagonist‚Äôs path because the timeline tells them to rather than because they‚Äôre part of an organic, escalating scenario that forces the protagonist to confront her inner issue. Thus the dramatic events aren‚Äôt spawned by the story itself but by an external by-the-numbers story-structure formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 77
you must make sure that everything your protagonist faces‚Äîbeginning on page one‚Äîsprings specifically from the problem she needs to solve, both internally and externally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 77
using a generic ‚Äúbad situation‚Äù to create the protagonist‚Äôs goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 77
the spotlight remained on the problem rather than the protagonist. Sure, things happened, but they didn‚Äôt affect the protagonist on anything but a surface level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Because we had no clue what her specific desires, fears, or needs were beyond the very obvious one-dimensional need to get out of the current situation ASAP, we couldn‚Äôt anticipate how she would react to the things that happened, except in a generic, that‚Äôs-what-any-person-would-do sense. And that, my friends, is boring. Why? Because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 77
we all have a pretty good idea of what ‚Äúany person‚Äù would do. Where‚Äôs the suspense in that? We turn to story to tell us something we don‚Äôt know. So while we don‚Äôt care a whit about what ‚Äúany person‚Äù would do, we care passionately about what your protagonist would do‚Äîas long as we know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 78
Having a firm understanding of what your protagonist‚Äôs specific goals and fears mean to her provides you with concrete plot guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 79
Our goal is to make the reader feel like they know her, and‚Äîthis is essential‚Äîto care enough about her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 79
to want to find out what will happen to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 82
It is this kind of glimpse into someone else‚Äôs hopes and fears that makes stories so compelling‚Äîand so much more than mere entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 82
It‚Äôs hard to understand what other people want from us. It‚Äôs hard to know what we truly want for ourselves (well, besides another piece of that salted caramel chocolate). Stories not only give us much-needed practice in figuring out what makes people tick, they give us insight into how we tick.&lt;/p&gt;

What does achieving his goal mean to him, specifically? Do you know why? In short, what‚Äôs his motivation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 83
Remember, achieving his goal must fulfill a longstanding need or desire‚Äîand force him to face a deep-seated fear in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 83
What does achieving her external goal mean to her? How does she think it will affect how she sees herself? What does she think it will say about her? Is she right? Or is her internal goal at odds with her external goal?&lt;/p&gt;

What deeply held belief will she have to question?&lt;/p&gt;

WHEN I WAS FIVE, I closed my eyes and thought really hard about whether I was now invisible. After all, I couldn‚Äôt see anything, so how could anyone see me? Yes, I concluded: I had indeed vanished. It made perfect sense, and it was thrilling to boot. I felt very smart. And why not? Being wrong feels exactly like being right,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 84
Being wrong changes how we see‚Äîor don‚Äôt see‚Äîthe world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 84
And we‚Äôre wrong a lot, partly because in order to survive, we‚Äôre wired to draw conclusions about everything we see, whether or not we have all‚Äîor any‚Äîof the facts; and partly because, more often than not, it‚Äôs our cognitive unconscious that deftly constructs the implicit beliefs that then organize and rule our world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 84
According to neuropsychologist Justin Barrett, our implicit or ‚Äúnonreflective‚Äù beliefs are our default mode, constantly working behind the scenes to shape memory and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 86
Everyone here is so nice‚ÄîI better watch my back. And the scary thing is, we don‚Äôt even know we‚Äôre doing it until something happens that proves us wrong, and suddenly our implicit belief is catapulted into our conscious mind, where we have to either deal with it or work overtime to rationalize it away.3&lt;/p&gt;

T. S. Eliot so aptly noted, ‚ÄúThe end of our exploring will be to arrive at where we started, and to know the place for the first time.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 86
The best place to start working on a story is long before your poor unsuspecting protagonist shows up on page one. The best place to start is by pinpointing the moment long before, when she first fell prey to the inner issue that‚Äôs been skewing her worldview ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 87
But if you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs broke, how can you write a story about fixing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 88
‚ÄúNo surprise in the writer, no surprise in the reader.‚Äù7 Ditto Robert B. Parker, who says he has no idea where the story is going when he starts writing.&lt;/p&gt;

REALITY: Character Bios Should Concentrate Solely on Information Relevant to Your Story&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 90
The same goes for writing a general from-birth-to-the-present bio. The whole point of a story is to filter out the kind of unnecessary information such bios are full of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 91
Here‚Äôs the secret: you are looking only for information that pertains to the story you‚Äôre telling. If a story is about a problem, then what you‚Äôre looking for is the root of the problem that will blossom on page one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 91
That‚Äôs why, when writing your protagonist‚Äôs bio, the goal is to pinpoint two things: the event in his past that knocked his worldview out of alignment, triggering the internal issue that keeps him from achieving his goal; and the inception of his desire for the goal itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 92
Things start out one way and end up another‚Äîthis is what is meant by a story‚Äôs arc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 92
story itself unfolds in the space between the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and the ‚Äúafter.‚Äù It chronicles the exhilarating time when things are in flux, giving the reader the illusion that it really could go either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 92
Thus what you‚Äôre looking for when you write your character bios is the specific before that leads to the moment when suddenly everything is in flux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 92
‚Äúbefore‚Äù is the yardstick that allows the reader to measure the protagonist‚Äôs progress toward ‚Äúafter.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 94
‚ÄúCharacter is action‚Äù‚Äîmeaning the things we do reveal who we are, especially because, as Gazzaniga reminds us, ‚ÄúOur actions tend to reflect our automatic intuitive thinking or beliefs.‚Äù13 Story is often about a protagonist coming to realize what‚Äôs really causing him to do the things he does, at which point he either celebrates, because he‚Äôs better than he thought, or begins making amends, because he‚Äôs worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 96
If you can‚Äôt picture it, it‚Äôs general. If you can see it, it‚Äôs specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 102
When you close your eyes, can you envision what happens, or is it still conceptual? If you can‚Äôt see it, there will be no yardstick to measure your protagonist‚Äôs progress. You can‚Äôt have an after without a before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 102
idea), but unless you have some clue where it‚Äôs headed, how can you be sure you‚Äôve sown the seeds of the future there on page one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 103
‚ÄúMy particular ability does not lie in mathematical calculation, but rather in visualizing effects, possibilities, and consequences.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 105
Remember, we‚Äôre hardwired to instantly evaluate everything in life on the basis of is it safe or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 105
‚ÄúThe entire fabric of a conscious mind is created from the same cloth‚Äîimages.‚Äù4 Neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran agrees: ‚ÄúHumans excel at visual imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 106
Damasio says, ‚ÄúSmart brains are also extremely lazy. Anytime they can do less instead of more, they will, a minimalist philosophy they follow religiously.‚Äù6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 106
The point is, if I ask you to think about something, you can decide not to. But if I make you feel something? Now I have your attention. Feeling is a reaction; our&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 107
feelings let us know what matters to us, and our thoughts have no choice but to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 107
Facts that don‚Äôt affect us‚Äîeither directly or because we can‚Äôt imagine how the facts affect someone else‚Äîdon‚Äôt matter to us. And that explains why one personalized story has infinitely more impact than an impersonal generalization, even though the scope of the generalization is a thousand times greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 107
Feel first. Think second. That‚Äôs the magic of story. Story takes a general situation, idea, or premise and personifies it via the very specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 112
not only do we think in story and in images, but as cognitive linguist George Lakoff points out, although we may not always know it, we also think in metaphor.8 Metaphor is how the mind ‚Äúcouches the abstract concepts in concrete terms.‚Äù9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 112
Believe it or not, we utter about six metaphors a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 113
To quote Aristotle‚Äôs perfect definition: a ‚Äúmetaphor consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to something else.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 114
Because the reader has no point of reference, the best she can do is make up something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 117
Mary Poppins‚Äô sage advice in mind: enough is as good as a feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118

REALITY: Unless They Convey Necessary Information, Sensory Details Clog a Story‚Äôs Arteries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 121
The description of a room should reveal something about the person&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 121
who lives in it or hint at the whereabouts of the missing diamond or tell us something crucial about the zeitgeist of the community in which the story unfolds‚Äîor better yet, all three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
So if you want to write a novel that inspires people you‚Äôve never even met to call their friends and say, ‚ÄúYou gotta read this book,‚Äù you need to root through your story and make sure you‚Äôve translated anything brain-numbingly vague, abstract, or generic into something that‚Äôs surprisingly specific, deliciously tangible, and grippingly visceral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 123
Do all the ‚Äúsensory details‚Äù‚Äîthat is, what something tastes, feels, or looks like‚Äîhave an actual story reason to be there, beyond ‚Äújust because‚Äù? You want to be sure each sensory detail is strategically placed to give us insight into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 123
your characters, your story, and perhaps even your theme. And remember, scenery without subtext is a travelogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 124
THE BRAIN DOESN‚ÄôT LIKE CHANGE. Would you, if you‚Äôd spent millions of years evolving with the sole goal of maintaining a constant, stable equilibrium?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 124
masterful spin doctors, rationalizers, and justifiers of threatening information and go to great lengths to maintain a sense of well-being.‚Äù3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 124
We don‚Äôt like change, and we don‚Äôt like conflict, either. So most of the time we do our best to avoid both. This isn‚Äôt easy, since the only real constant is change, and change is driven by conflict. This or that? Me or you? Chocolate or vanilla?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 126
And there‚Äôs the paradox: we survived because we‚Äôre risk takers, but our goal is to stay safe by not changing an iota unless we absolutely have to. Talk about conflict! And that brings us right back to story. Story‚Äôs job is to tackle exactly how we handle that conflict, which boils down to this: the battle between fear and desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 127
Indeed, it ripples through the story in the guise of mounting tension, engendering in the reader that delicious dopamine-driven sensation we‚Äôre addicted to when it comes to a good tale: suspense, the desire to find out what‚Äôs really going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 127
a recent study using magnetic resonance imaging revealed that intense social rejection activates the same areas in the brain that physical pain does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 129
in fact, literally happening to us. So, although we feel Juliet‚Äôs anguish on awaking to find Romeo lifeless by her side, we never once lose sight of the fact that our own beloved is, in fact, snoring peacefully in the theater seat next to us. And that, my friends, is what makes stories so deeply satisfying. We get to try on trouble, pretty much risk-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 129
And so in literature, not as in life, the goal is to embrace conflict and harness it to suspense. Now, for the sixty-four-thousand-dollar question: how do you translate impending conflict into ongoing suspense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 144
Antonio Damasio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 146
Kathryn Schulz of Being Wrong attests: ‚ÄúWe think this one thing is going to happen, and something else happens instead.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 146
we‚Äôll take a look at why ‚Äúshow, don‚Äôt tell‚Äù is a matter of why rather than what; and we‚Äôll introduce the all-important ‚ÄúAnd so?‚Äù test to guarantee that neither cause-and-effect trajectory ever goes off the rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 146
As we know, both life and story are driven by emotion, but what they‚Äôre ordered by is logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 152
Since stories are about how what happens affects someone‚ÄîJoe, for instance‚Äîthe reason he popped the balloon is more important than the fact that he popped it. In short, the why carries more weight than the what. Think of it as a pecking order: the why comes first, because it drives the what; the why is the cause; the what is the effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 152
it‚Äôs about why. The internal, story-level cause-and-effect trajectory tracks the evolution of the protagonist‚Äôs inner issue, which is what motivates his actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 152
MYTH: ‚ÄúShow, Don‚Äôt Tell‚Äù Is Literal‚ÄîDon‚Äôt Tell Me John Is Sad, Show Him Crying REALITY: ‚ÄúShow, Don‚Äôt Tell‚Äù Is Figurative‚ÄîDon‚Äôt Tell Me John Is Sad, Show Me Why&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 152
He‚Äôs Sad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 155
As Chekhov so famously said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 157
What does my protagonist want to have happen during this scene? That established, ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat is at stake here?‚Äù What will it cost her to get what she wants? Armed with this info, you‚Äôre ready to write the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 157
Has the protagonist changed? He should start out feeling one way and end up feeling another‚Äîoften the exact opposite of how he originally felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 157
Having weighed his options, given what was at stake, and then made a decision, does he now see things differently than he did when the scene opened? ¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢ Do we know why he made the decision he did? Do we understand how he arrived at that particular conclusion, even‚Äîmake that especially‚Äîif his reasoning is flawed? Can we see how this changed his assessment of what‚Äôs going on and how he‚Äôs adjusted his game plan accordingly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 157
Notice that once again it‚Äôs the protagonist‚Äôs internal reaction to what happens that not only dictates what happens next but also gives it meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 159
story is driven by the protagonist‚Äôs internal struggle,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 159
plot twists tend to stem from her attempt to get the most by giving up the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 159
And just like in real life, as we‚Äôll explore in depth in the next chapter, this usually only succeeds in making the situation worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 159
we‚Äôre wired to predict what will happen next, and the way we do this is by charting patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 160
Since a huge part of the pleasure of reading is trying to figure out what‚Äôs going to happen, readers will be spinning possible scenarios all on their own‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 161
Each thing you add to your story is like a drop of paint falling into a bowl of clear water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:metaphor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 161
It spreads and colors everything. As with life, new information causes us to reevaluate the meaning and emotional weight of all that preceded it, and to see the future with fresh eyes.14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 161
Chekhov to note to S. Shchukin, ‚ÄúIf you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 161
If it‚Äôs not going to be fired, it shouldn‚Äôt be hanging there.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 161
Gilbert says, ‚Äúevery action has a cause and a consequence,‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 162
This means you can gauge whether a particular scene is part of the great chain of cause and effect by asking yourself these questions: ¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢ Does this scene impart a crucial piece of information, without which some future scene won‚Äôt make sense? ¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢ Does it have a clear cause the reader can see (even if the ‚Äúreal reason‚Äù it happened will be revealed later)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 162
‚Ä¢ Does it provide insight into why the characters acted as they did? ¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢ Does it raise the reader‚Äôs expectation of specific, imminent action?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 163
And that, my friends, is why, when it comes to digressions, heartless as it may seem, you have to kill them before they kill your story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 163
Mark Twain meant when he said, ‚ÄúA successful book is not made of what is in it, but what is left out.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 164
A digression is any piece of information that we don‚Äôt need and therefore don‚Äôt know what to do with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 164
the reader needs to know, at that moment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 165
Does your story follow a cause-and-effect trajectory beginning on page one, so that each scene is triggered by the one that preceded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 165
setting up a line of dominoes‚Äîyou tap that first one, and they all fall in perfect order as each scene puts the ‚Äúdecision‚Äù made in the prior scene to the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 165
Does everything in your story‚Äôs cause-and-effect trajectory revolve around the protagonist‚Äôs quest (the story question)? If it doesn‚Äôt, get rid of it. It‚Äôs that easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 165
We don‚Äôt care about a hurricane, a stock market crash, or aliens taking over planet Earth unless it somehow directly affects your protagonist‚Äôs quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 165
When your protagonist makes a decision, is it always clear how she arrived at it, especially when she‚Äôs changing her mind about something? Don‚Äôt forget, just because you know what your protagonist is thinking doesn‚Äôt mean your readers will. Does each scene follow the action, reaction, decision pattern? It‚Äôs like the one, two, three of a waltz. Get that rhythm stuck in your head‚Äîaction, reaction, decision‚Äîand then use it to build momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 165
Can you answer the ‚ÄúAnd so?‚Äù to everything in the story? Ask this question relentlessly, like a four-year-old, and the minute you can‚Äôt answer, know that you‚Äôre likely in the company of a darling, a digression, or something else likely to cause your story to go into free fall.&lt;/p&gt;

The catch is, your protagonist really truly does have to suffer‚Äîotherwise not only will she have nothing to teach us, but we won‚Äôt have much reason to care about what happens to her, either.&lt;/p&gt;

REALITY: A Literary Novel Has Just As Much Plot As a Mass Market Potboiler, If Not More&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 170
Remember: a story revolves around events that force the protagonist to come to grips with a difficult inner issue‚Äîwhich, ironically, is something literary novels are far more geared to convey. So don‚Äôt fall prey to this tired old saw; instead, kick it to the curb‚Äîpoetically, if you must. Case Study: Sullivan‚Äôs Travels‚ÄîThe Evolution of a Bumpy Night&lt;/p&gt;

As Steven Pinker points out, stories can help us ‚Äúexpand the range of options in life by testing, in small increments, how closely one can approach the brink of disaster without falling over it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 179
Do encourage your characters to lie. While in real life, we don‚Äôt want people to lie to us, in a story, characters who lie are the ones who catch our interest.&lt;/p&gt;

Anthony Wagner, when trying to focus on multiple sources of information coming from the external world or emerging out of memory, people are ‚Äúnot able to filter out what‚Äôs not relevant to their current goal.‚Äù8 Thus, while the reader‚Äôs mind mulls over the import of Betty‚Äôs boyfriend, the significance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 194
We know anticipation feels really good, and that what readers love to hunt for is the emerging path from setups to payoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 194
After all, a big part of the pleasure of reading is recognizing, interpreting, and then connecting the dots so the pattern emerges. To make that possible, there are three basic rules it behooves writers to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 199
Is there a clear series of events‚Äîa pattern‚Äîthat begins with the setup and culminates in the payoff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 200
Memory mines the information your brain has acquired in the past for anything that might help it solve the problem you‚Äôre facing in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 200
storing information is adaptive: it supports future decisions and judgments that cannot be known with certainty in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

In his book Self Comes to Mind, neuroscientist Antonio Damasio speculates&lt;/p&gt;

‚Äúthe ability to navigate the future in the seas of our imagination, guiding the self craft into a safe and productive harbor.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 200
We use the past as a yardstick against which we size up the present in order to make it to tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 200
Memories are continually revised, along with the meaning we derive from them, so that in the future they‚Äôll be of even more use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 200
memories aren‚Äôt just for reminiscing. They never were. Memories are for navigating the now.&lt;/p&gt;

cousin, Tony B.‚Äî‚ÄúAll due respect, you got no f&lt;em&gt;ckin‚Äô idea what it‚Äôs like to be number one. Every decision you make affects every facet of every other f&lt;/em&gt;ckin‚Äô thing. It‚Äôs too much to deal with almost.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 203
That is to say, the crow flies in spirals. Because it‚Äôs not just about getting from point A to point Z; it‚Äôs about being aware of everything‚Äîpast, present, and future, internal and external‚Äîthat affects the protagonist‚Äôs struggle, each step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

How do you capture the multilayered experience of life on something as two-dimensional as a sheet of paper, in a medium as linear as words?&lt;/p&gt;

The goal is to set the pace so each burst of intense conflict in the main storyline‚Äîeach sudden sprint, each unexpected twist‚Äîis fueled by the information and insight that‚Äôs been building since the previous twist.&lt;/p&gt;

my father kept saying. ‚ÄúDo it as you would do scales on the piano. Do it by prearrangement with yourself. Do it as a debt of honor. And make a commitment to finishing things.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

The act of writing turns out to be its&lt;/p&gt;

Getting Started The very first thing I tell my new students on the first day of a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 306
workshop is that good writing is about telling the truth. We are a species that needs and wants to understand who we are.&lt;/p&gt;

When I had been writing food reviews for a number of years, there were so many restaurants and individual dishes in my brainpan that when people asked for a recommendation, I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 319
couldn‚Äôt think of a single restaurant where I‚Äôd ever actually eaten. But if the person could narrow it down to, say, Indian, I might remember one lavish Indian palace, where my date had asked the waiter for the Rudyard Kipling sampler and later for the holy-cow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:General to specific&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 320
cow tartare. Then a number of memories would come to mind, of other dates and other Indian restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 345
Then, with your fingers poised on the keyboard, you squint at an image that is forming in your mind‚Äîa scene, a locale, a character, whatever‚Äîand you try to quiet your mind so you can hear what that landscape or character has to say above the other voices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 347
in your mind. The other voices are banshees and drunken monkeys. They are the voices of anxiety, judgment, doom, guilt. Also, severe hypochondria. There may be a Nurse Ratched‚Äìlike listing of things that must be done right this moment: foods that must come out of the freezer, appointments that must be canceled or made, hairs that must be tweezed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 349
But you hold an imaginary gun to your head and make yourself stay at the desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 362
But the bad news is that if you‚Äôre at all like me, you‚Äôll probably read over what you‚Äôve written and spend the rest of the day obsessing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 363
and praying that you do not die before you can completely rewrite or destroy what you have written, lest the eagerly waiting world learn how bad your first drafts are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 386
However, in the meantime, we are going to concentrate on writing itself, on how to become a better writer, because, for one thing, becoming a better writer is going to help you become a better reader, and that is the real payoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 397
by Phillip Lopate that someone once sent me, that goes: We who are your closest friends feel the time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 439
Writing can give you what having a baby can give you: it can get you to start paying attention, can help you soften, can wake you up. But publishing won‚Äôt do any of those things; you‚Äôll never get in that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 451
But it is fantasy to think that successful writers do not have these bored, defeated hours, these hours of deep insecurity when one feels as small and jumpy as a water bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 452
They do. But they also often feel a great sense of amazement that they get to write, and they know that this is what they want to do for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 459
we may notice amazing details during the course of a day but we rarely let ourselves stop and really pay attention. An author makes you notice, makes you pay attention, and this is a great gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:Author does&lt;/p&gt;

E. L. Doctorow once said that ‚Äúwriting a novel is like driving a car at night. You can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

actually gives them hope, and hope, as Chesterton said, is the power of being cheerful in circumstances that we know to be desperate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 500
Writing can be a pretty desperate endeavor, because it is about some of our deepest needs: our need to be visible, to be heard, our need to make sense of our lives, to wake up and grow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 502
In the Bill Murray movie Stripes, in which he joins the army, there is a scene that takes place the first night of boot camp,&lt;/p&gt;

Almost all good writing begins with terrible first efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 565
And the third draft is the dental draft, where you check every tooth, to see if it‚Äôs loose or cramped or decayed, or even, God help us, healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

First there‚Äôs the vinegar-lipped Reader Lady, who says primly, ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs not very interesting, is it?‚Äù And there‚Äôs the emaciated German male who writes these Orwellian memos detailing your thought crimes. And there are your parents, agonizing over your lack of loyalty and discretion; and there‚Äôs William Burroughs,&lt;/p&gt;

Quieting these voices is at least half the battle I fight daily.&lt;/p&gt;

Left to its own devices, my mind spends much of its time having conversations with people who aren‚Äôt there.&lt;/p&gt;

but then he gave me the following exercise, which I still use to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 578
Close your eyes and get quiet for a minute, until the chatter starts up. Then isolate one of the voices and imagine the person speaking as a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 593
Perfectionism means that you try desperately not to leave so much mess to clean up. But clutter and mess show us that life is being lived. Clutter is wonderfully fertile ground‚Äîyou can still discover new treasures under all those piles, clean things up, edit things out, fix things, get a grip. Tidiness suggests that something is as good as it‚Äôs going&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 595
Tidiness makes me think of held breath, of suspended animation, while writing needs to breathe and move.&lt;/p&gt;

She explained that when we have a wound in our body, the nearby muscles cramp around it to protect it from any more violation and from infection, and that I would need to use these muscles if I wanted them to relax again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:Book&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 605
think that something similar happens with our psychic muscles. They cramp around our wounds‚Äîthe pain from our childhood, the losses and disappointments of adulthood, the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 606
humiliations suffered in both‚Äîto keep us from getting hurt in the same place again, to keep foreign substances out. So those wounds never have a chance to heal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 607
Perfectionism is one way our muscles cramp. In some cases we don‚Äôt even know that the wounds and the cramping are there, but both limit us. They keep us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 608
moving and writing in tight, worried ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:Our traumas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 619
that awareness is learning to keep yourself company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 622
In any case, the bottom line is that if you want to write, you get to, but you probably won‚Äôt be able to get very far if you don‚Äôt start trying to get over your perfectionism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 627
Still, even on those days, you might notice how great perseverance feels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 629
Your day‚Äôs work might turn out to have been a mess. So what? Vonnegut said, ‚ÄúWhen I write, I feel like an armless legless man with a crayon in his mouth.‚Äù So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 631
Perfectionism is a mean, frozen form of idealism, while messes are the artist‚Äôs true friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 632
when we were children was that we need to make messes in order to find out who we are and why we are here‚Äîand,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 633
by extension, what we‚Äôre supposed to be writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 682
heard Natalie Goldberg, the author of Writing Down the Bones, speak on writing once. Someone asked her for&lt;/p&gt;

Your parents would sometimes send you to school with waxed-paper packets of uneven cuckoo-bunny carrots, and your carrot esteem would be so low you couldn‚Äôt even risk looking at the guy against the fence. Bad juju.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 706
Writing a first draft is very much like watching a Polaroid develop. You can‚Äôt‚Äîand, in fact, you‚Äôre not supposed to‚Äîknow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 706
know exactly what the picture is going to look like until it has finished developing.&lt;/p&gt;

She said that every single one of us at birth is given an emotional acre all our own.&lt;/p&gt;

What are your characters teaching their children by example and by indoctrination? For instance, I was teaching Sam peace chants for a long time, when he was only two.&lt;/p&gt;

I once asked Ethan Canin to tell me the most valuable thing he knew about writing, and without hesitation he said, ‚ÄúNothing is as important as a likable narrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 813
If your narrator is someone whose take on things fascinates you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 814
isn‚Äôt really going to matter if nothing much happens for a long time. I could watch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 815
Having a likable narrator is like having a great friend whose company you love, whose mind you love to pick, whose running commentary totally holds your attention,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 819
Now, a person‚Äôs faults are largely what make him or her likable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 826
a friend or a narrator reveals himself or herself to be hopeless too early on, I lose interest. It depresses me. It makes me overeat. I don‚Äôt mind if a person has no hope if he or she is sufficiently&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 827
funny about the whole thing, but then, this being able to be funny definitely speaks of a kind of hope, of buoyancy.&lt;/p&gt;

Faulkner for the beauty of his horrible creations, the beauty of the writing, and we read him to find out what life is about from his point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

All you can give us is what life is about from your point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 879
Find out what each character cares most about in the world because then you will have discovered what‚Äôs at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

tell my students to write this down‚Äîthat the dream must be vivid and continuous‚Äîbecause&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 939
The climax is that major event, usually toward the end, that brings all the tunes you have been playing so far into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 939
one major chord, after which at least one of your people is profoundly changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 963
And we have all the pleasures of voyeurism because the characters don‚Äôt know we are listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 998
Thus, good dialogue encompasses both what is said and what is not said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,015
from what you read. Your reading&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,048
I need to digress again for a minute: you create these characters and figure out little by little what they say and do, but this all happens in a part of you to which you have no access‚Äîthe unconscious. This is where the creating&lt;/p&gt;

Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones

ON THE FINAL day of my sophomore year of high school, I was hit in the face with a baseball bat. As my classmate took a full swing, the bat slipped out of his hands and came flying toward me before striking me directly between the eyes. I have no memory of the moment of impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 134
I built good sleep habits and went to bed early each night. In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to keep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confident again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 137
A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly‚Äîand, in many cases, automatically. As each semester passed, I accumulated small but consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to me when I started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 150
changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you‚Äôre willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 151
depends on the quality of our habits.1 With the same habits, you‚Äôll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 160
I began by publishing a new article every Monday and Thursday. Within a few months, this simple writing habit led to my first one thousand email subscribers, and by the end of 2013 that number had grown to more than thirty thousand people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 165
In 2015, I reached two hundred thousand email subscribers and signed a book deal with Penguin Random House to begin writing the book you are reading now. As my audience grew, so did my business opportunities. I was increasingly asked to speak at top companies about the science of habit formation, behavior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 167
change, and continuous improvement. I found myself delivering keynote speeches at conferences in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

The entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, ‚ÄúTo write a great book, you must first become the book.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 186
The fields I draw on‚Äîbiology, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, and more‚Äîhave been around for many years. What I offer you is a synthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out a long time ago as well as the most compelling discoveries scientists have made recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 188
My contribution, I hope, is to find the ideas that matter most and connect them in a way that is highly actionable. Anything wise in these pages you should credit to the many experts who preceded me. Anything foolish, assume it is my error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 195
Behavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you offered the right reward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain way. But while Skinner‚Äôs model did an excellent job of explaining how external stimuli influenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior. Internal states‚Äîour moods and emotions‚Äîmatter, too. In recent decades, scientists have begun to determine the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behavior. This research will also be covered in these pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 246
WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 247
It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 248
Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 248
requires massive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 249
Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 250
Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn‚Äôt particularly notable‚Äîsometimes it isn‚Äôt even noticeable‚Äîbut it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here‚Äôs how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you‚Äôll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you‚Äôre done.12 Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you‚Äôll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 259
Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 260
The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 277
Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 279
Success is the product of daily habits‚Äînot once-in-a-lifetime transformations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 284
Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 285
your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 287
If you want to predict where you‚Äôll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 288
Are you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 290
Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 319
The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change. Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This pattern&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 321
shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months.18 Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 324
Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 335
When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. The outside&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 354
All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 360
FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 365
began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 367
Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 379
life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 381

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 383
Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 395
Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That‚Äôs the counterintuitive thing about improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 400
The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: ‚ÄúOnce I reach my goal, then I‚Äôll be happy.‚Äù The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you‚Äôre continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 404
Furthermore, goals create an ‚Äúeither-or‚Äù conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 407
A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don‚Äôt have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 414
The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It‚Äôs not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 420
You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 442
Few things can have a more powerful impact on your life than improving your daily habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 448
Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 459
The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 461
Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 464
Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 470
Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 470
‚ÄúNo thanks. I‚Äôm trying to quit.‚Äù It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs. The second person declines by saying, ‚ÄúNo thanks. I‚Äôm not a smoker.‚Äù It‚Äôs a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who smokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 474
Most people don‚Äôt even consider identity change when they set out to improve. They just think, ‚ÄúI want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I‚Äôll be skinny (process).‚Äù They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don‚Äôt realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 483
Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 486
hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven‚Äôt changed who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 497
The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It‚Äôs one thing to say I‚Äôm the type of person who wants this. It‚Äôs something very different to say I‚Äôm the type of person who is this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 499
The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 502
Once your pride gets involved, you‚Äôll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 505
Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.&lt;/p&gt;

The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. ‚ñ† The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. ‚ñ† The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.&lt;/p&gt;

Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are‚Äîeither consciously or nonconsciously.fn1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 528
When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 537
Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 542
Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.fn2 More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 546
The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your ‚Äúrepeated beingness.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 557
Each experience in life modifies your self-image, but it‚Äôs unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 561
In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 561
This is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit.6 We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 566
Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 568
Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That‚Äôs the paradox of making small improvements. Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 576
Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 577
When the votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 583
It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 591
For example, ‚ÄúWho is the type of person who could write a book?‚Äù It‚Äôs probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus shifts from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is consistent and reliable (identity-based).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 598
Once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity.&lt;/p&gt;

She figured if she acted like a healthy person long enough, eventually she would become that person. She was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 604
The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 606
Identity change is the North Star of habit change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 608
‚ÄúAre you becoming the type of person you want to become?‚Äù The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder. And that‚Äôs why we are starting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 610
You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 611
choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. And this brings us to the deeper purpose of this book and the real reason habits matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 619
‚ñ† There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 621
The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 622
Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 624
Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 625
The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 649
A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 650
The process of habit formation begins with trial and error. Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you come across a problem, you‚Äôre not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndike‚Äôs cat, you‚Äôre just trying things out to see what works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 663
As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, ‚ÄúHabits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 670
Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution. The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 677
Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 682
Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 697
First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 703
Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire‚Äîwithout craving a change‚Äîwe have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides. You are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth. You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be entertained. Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 709
For someone who rarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are just background noise. Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 716
habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 721
Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones.11 Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 745
All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 785
The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. ‚ñ† Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 788
The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

The human brain is a prediction machine.5 It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 814
across. Whenever you experience something repeatedly‚Äîlike a paramedic seeing the face of a heart attack patient or a military analyst seeing a missile on a radar screen‚Äîyour brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use.&lt;/p&gt;

My wife does something similar. Whenever we are preparing to walk out the door for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essential items in her packing list. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got my keys. I‚Äôve got my wallet. I‚Äôve got my glasses. I‚Äôve got my husband.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 911
The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 925
The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 980
Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can‚Äôt say why. As the writer Jason Zweig noted, ‚ÄúObviously you‚Äôre never going to just work out without conscious thought.9 But like a dog salivating at a bell, maybe you start to get antsy around the time of day you normally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 984
work out.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 1,009
When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.&lt;/p&gt;

People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are.2 If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of cookies on the counter, I‚Äôll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn‚Äôt been thinking about them beforehand and didn‚Äôt necessarily feel hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E).3 It didn‚Äôt take long&lt;/p&gt;

We like to think that we are in control. If we choose water over soda, we assume it is because we wanted to do so. The truth, however, is that many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 1,147
The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision. The human body has about eleven million sensory receptors.7 Approximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that half of the brain‚Äôs resources are used on vision.&lt;/p&gt;

As a result, you can imagine how important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,160
the homes with the meters located in the main hallway used less electricity. When their energy use was obvious and easy to track, people changed their behavior.9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,185
The same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you‚Äôll think about your habit throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,188
Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people live in a world others have created for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,190
Environment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,192
The cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. For example, many people drink more in social situations than they would ever drink&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,195
alone. The trigger is rarely a single cue, but rather the whole situation: watching your friends order drinks, hearing the music at the bar, seeing the beers on tap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,196
We mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur: the home, the office, the gym. Each location develops a connection to certain habits and routines. You establish a particular relationship with the objects on your desk, the items on your kitchen counter, the things in your bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 1,198
Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 1,199
Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 1,208
The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be easier to change in a new environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 1,209
It helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a new place‚Äîa different coffee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you seldom use‚Äîand create a new routine there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 1,211
It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 1,213
But when you step outside your normal environment, you leave your behavioral biases behind.13 You aren‚Äôt battling old environmental cues, which allows new habits to form without interruption.14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 1,216
Want to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a rooftop patio, or a building with expansive architecture. Take a break from the space where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your current thought patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

Trying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on autopilot at your regular supermarket. Try a new grocery store. You may find it easier to avoid unhealthy food when your brain doesn‚Äôt automatically know where it is located in the store.&lt;/p&gt;

Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you‚Äôll start mixing habits‚Äîand the easier ones will usually win out.&lt;/p&gt;

enough. If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for reading,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 1,236
his phone only for social media and texting. Every habit should have a home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 1,237
If you can manage to stick with this strategy, each context will become associated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Habits thrive under predictable circumstances like these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 1,239
If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable.&lt;/p&gt;

overweight, a smoker, or an addict, you‚Äôve been told your entire life that it is because you lack self-control‚Äîmaybe even that you‚Äôre a bad person. The idea that a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is deeply embedded in our culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,274
Recent research, however, shows something different. When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren‚Äôt all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, ‚Äúdisciplined‚Äù people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,278
The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It‚Äôs easier to practice self-restraint when you don‚Äôt have to use it very often.6 So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.&lt;/p&gt;

Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it‚Äôs unlikely you can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,317
muster the willpower to override your desires every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,318
Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment. This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,321
The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible. ‚ñ† Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten. ‚ñ† People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It‚Äôs easier to avoid temptation than resist it. ‚ñ† One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. ‚ñ† Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,371
Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,372
like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball‚Äîand it elicits a stronger response than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,373
Humans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions of reality. Junk food, for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. After spending hundreds of thousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the wild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value on salt, sugar, and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and they were quite rare when our ancient ancestors were roaming the savannah. When you don‚Äôt know where your next meal is coming from, eating as much as possible is an excellent strategy for survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 1,377
Today, however, we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food is abundant, but your brain continues to crave it like it is scarce. Placing a high value on salt, sugar, and fat is no longer advantageous to our health, but the craving persists because the brain‚Äôs reward centers have not changed for approximately fifty thousand years. The modern food industry relies on stretching our Paleolithic instincts beyond their evolutionary purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 1,384
Entire departments are dedicated to optimizing how a product feels in your mouth‚Äîa quality known as orosensation. French fries, for example, are a potent combination‚Äîgolden brown and crunchy on the outside, light and smooth on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 1,389
But foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep the experience novel and interesting, encouraging you to eat more.&lt;/p&gt;

Stephan Guyenet, a neuroscientist who specializes in eating behavior and obesity, says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gotten too good at pushing our own buttons.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,395
The modern food industry, and the overeating habits it has spawned, is just one example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: Make it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,397
Look around. Society is filled with highly engineered versions of reality that are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in. Stores feature mannequins with exaggerated hips and breasts to sell clothes. Social media delivers more ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and praise in a few minutes than we could ever get in the office or at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,400
Advertisements are created with a combination of ideal lighting, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits‚Äîeven the model doesn‚Äôt look like the person in the final image. These are the supernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate features that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result, driving us into excessive shopping habits, social media habits, porn habits, eating habits, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,406
Compared to nature, these pleasure-packed experiences are hard to resist. We have the brains of our ancestors but temptations they never had to face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,408
While it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by understanding what a craving is and how it works. We begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share‚Äîthe dopamine spike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,412
Scientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring a neurotransmitter called dopamine.fn1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,421
Even though dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn‚Äôt want it anymore. The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped.11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,424
In one study, mice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time they poked their nose in a box. Within minutes, the mice developed a craving so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,425
strong they began poking their nose into the box eight hundred times per hour.12 (Humans are not so different: the average slot machine player will spin the wheel six hundred times per hour.13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,428
Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop.14 Every behavior that is highly habit-forming‚Äîtaking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social media‚Äîis associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,431
For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,433
dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,436
Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,438
It is the anticipation of a reward‚Äînot the fulfillment of it‚Äîthat gets us to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,439
Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward.18 This is one reason the anticipation of an experience can often feel better than the attainment of it. As a child, thinking about Christmas morning can be better than opening the gifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more enjoyable than actually being on vacation. Scientists refer to this as the difference between ‚Äúwanting‚Äù and ‚Äúliking.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,459
Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,459
The wanting centers in the brain are large: the brain stem, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal striatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal cortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are much smaller. They are often referred to as ‚Äúhedonic hot spots‚Äù and are distributed like tiny islands throughout the brain. For instance, researchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens is activated during wanting.19 Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is activated during liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,464
The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,465
of the crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response. These insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change. We need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the first place. This is where a strategy known as temptation bundling comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,493
Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as Premack‚Äôs Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that ‚Äúmore probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.‚Äù23 In other words, even if you don‚Äôt really want to process overdue work emails, you‚Äôll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do something you really want to do along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,510
We began this chapter by discussing supernormal stimuli, which are heightened versions of reality that increase our desire to take action. Temptation bundling is one way to create a heightened version of any habit by connecting it with something you already want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,514

The Polgar sisters grew up in a culture that prioritized chess above all else‚Äîpraised them for it, rewarded them for it. In their world, an obsession with chess was normal.

As Charles Darwin noted, ‚ÄúIn the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.‚Äù As a result, one of the deepest human desires is to belong. And this ancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,564
We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:2 The close. The many. The powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,570
We pick up habits from the people around us. We copy the way our parents handle arguments, the way our peers flirt with one another, the way our coworkers get results. When your friends smoke pot, you give it a try, too. When your wife has a habit of double-checking that the door is locked before going to bed, you pick it up as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,585
One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. New habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every day. If you are surrounded by fit people, you‚Äôre more likely to consider working out to be a common habit. If you‚Äôre surrounded by jazz lovers, you‚Äôre more likely to believe it‚Äôs reasonable to play jazz every day. Your culture sets your expectation for what is ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You‚Äôll rise together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,590
To make your habits even more attractive, you can take this strategy one step further. Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. Steve Kamb, an entrepreneur in New York City, runs a company called Nerd Fitness, which ‚Äúhelps nerds, misfits, and mutants lose weight,&lt;/p&gt;

Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It transforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on your own. Your identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,599
We are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,626
Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, ‚ÄúWhat is everyone else doing?‚Äù We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the ‚Äúbest‚Äù buying, eating, and travel habits. It‚Äôs usually a smart strategy. There is evidence in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,629
But there can be a downside. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. For example, one study found that when a chimpanzee learns an effective way to crack nuts open as a member of one group and then switches to a new group that uses a less effective strategy, it will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to blend in with the rest of the chimps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,633
The reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we‚Äôd rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,635
The human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants to get along with others. This is our natural mode. You can override it‚Äîyou can choose to ignore the group or to stop caring what other people think‚Äîbut it takes work. Running against the grain of your culture requires extra effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,637

Historically, a person with greater power and status has access to more resources, worries less about survival, and proves to be a more attractive mate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,643
We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration, and status. We want to be the one in the gym who can do muscle-ups or the musician who can play the hardest chord progressions or the parent with the most accomplished children because these things separate us from the crowd. Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,645
This is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly effective people. We try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,649
High-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of others. And that means if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,650
We are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our status. We trim our hedges and mow our lawn because we don‚Äôt want to be the slob of the neighborhood. When our mother comes to visit, we clean up the house because we don‚Äôt want to be judged. We are continually wondering ‚ÄúWhat will others think of me?‚Äù and altering our behavior based on the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,659
The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. ‚ñ† We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. ‚ñ† We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). ‚ñ† One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,665
something in common with the group. ‚ñ† The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we‚Äôd rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves. ‚ñ† If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of old vices. The underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same. The specific habits we perform differ based on the period of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,721
Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it. Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. As we covered&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,723
in our discussion of the 1st Law, your brain is continually absorbing information and noticing cues in the environment. Every time you perceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction about what to do in the next moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,734
Two people can look at the same cigarette, and one feels the urge to smoke while the other is repulsed by the smell. The same cue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on your prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,736
These predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically describe a craving‚Äîa feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,741
A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state. When the temperature falls, there is a gap between what your body is currently sensing and what it wants to be sensing. This gap between your current state and your desired state provides a reason to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,744
Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,747
Our feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current state or to make&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,747

In time, you learn to predict that checking social media will help you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow you to forget your fears. Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,756
You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. For instance, we often talk about everything we have to do in a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner for your family. Now, imagine changing just one word: You don‚Äôt ‚Äúhave‚Äù to. You ‚Äúget‚Äù to.4 You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,763
The key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.&lt;/p&gt;

At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best photos were produced by the quantity group. During the semester, these students were busy taking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting, testing out various methods in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. In the process of creating hundreds of photos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile, the quality group sat around speculating about perfection. In the end, they had little to show for their efforts other than unverified theories and one mediocre photo.&lt;/p&gt;

Each time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular neural circuit associated with that habit. This means that simply putting in your reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,899
All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.&lt;/p&gt;

The 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy. ‚ñ† The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe if you really wanted it, you‚Äôd actually do it. But the truth is, our real motivation is to be lazy and to do what is convenient. And despite what the latest productivity best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a dumb one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,973
Look at any behavior that fills up much of your life and you‚Äôll see that it can be performed with very low levels of motivation. Habits like scrolling on our phones, checking email, and watching television steal so much of our time because they can be performed almost without effort. They are remarkably convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,978
This is why it is crucial to make your habits so easy that you‚Äôll do them even when&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,979

One of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated with your habits is to practice environment design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,008
I like to refer to this strategy as addition by subtraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,039
‚Ä¶. People think I work hard but I‚Äôm actually really lazy. I‚Äôm just proactively lazy. It gives you so much time back.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work. ‚ñ† Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. ‚ñ† Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors.

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,090
Researchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given day are done out of habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,092
This is already a substantial percentage, but the true influence of your habits is even greater than these numbers suggest. Habits are automatic choices that influence the conscious&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,093
decisions that follow. Yes, a habit can be completed in just a few seconds, but it can also shape the actions that you take for minutes or hours afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,094
Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you‚Äôre speeding toward the next behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,095
It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different.&lt;/p&gt;

the ritual is changing into my workout clothes. If I change clothes, I know the workout will happen. Everything that follows‚Äîdriving to the gym, deciding which exercises to do, stepping under the bar‚Äîis easy once I‚Äôve taken the first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,104
Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as decisive moments.4 The moment you decide between ordering takeout or cooking dinner. The moment you choose between driving your car or riding your bike. The moment you decide between starting your homework or grabbing the video game controller. These choices are a fork in the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,107
Decisive moments set the options available to your future self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,110
Your options are constrained by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,110
what‚Äôs available. They are shaped by the first choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,116
We are limited by where our habits lead us. This is why mastering the decisive moments throughout your day is so important. Each day is made up of many moments, but it is really a few habitual choices that determine the path you take. These little choices stack up,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,118

Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have to standardize before you can optimize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,145
The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. By doing the same warm-up before every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peak performance.&lt;/p&gt;

Strategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce the identity you want to build. If you show up at the gym five days in a row‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs just for two minutes‚Äîyou are casting votes for your new identity. You‚Äôre not worried about getting in shape. You‚Äôre focused on becoming the type of person who doesn‚Äôt miss&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard. This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it difficult. If you find yourself continually struggling to follow through on your plans, then you can take a page from Victor Hugo and make&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,201
your bad habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a commitment device. A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future.2 It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones. When Victor Hugo shut his clothes away so he could focus on writing, he was creating a commitment device.4 fn2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,212
Commitment devices are useful because they enable you to take advantage of good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation. Whenever I‚Äôm looking to cut calories, for example, I will ask the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,214
waiter to split my meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served. If I waited until the meal came out and told myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just eat half,‚Äù it would never work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,215
The key is to change the task such that it requires more work to get out of the good habit than to get started on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,218
effort and may cost money. Commitment devices increase the odds that you‚Äôll do the right thing in the future by making bad habits difficult in the present. However, we can do even better. We can make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,236
The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don‚Äôt even have the option to act. The brilliance of the cash register was that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing practically impossible. Rather than trying to change the employees, it made the preferred behavior automatic.&lt;/p&gt;

As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead wrote, ‚ÄúCivilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

Technology creates a level of convenience that enables you to act on your smallest whims and desires. At the mere suggestion of hunger, you can have food delivered to your door. At the slightest hint of boredom, you can get lost in the vast expanse of social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,278
When the effort required to act on your desires becomes effectively zero, you can find yourself slipping into whatever impulse arises at the moment. The downside of automation is that we can find ourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but ultimately more rewarding, work.&lt;/p&gt;

It was a powerful example of the fourth and final Law of Behavior Change: make it satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,375
We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure‚Äîeven minor ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well‚Äîare signals that tell the brain: ‚ÄúThis feels good. Do this again, next time.‚Äù Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,383
Tasty flavors and the feeling of a fresh mouth provided little bits of immediate reinforcement and made the product satisfying to use. Consumption skyrocketed, and Wrigley became the largest chewing gum company in the world.9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,393
Stories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. You learn what to do in the future based on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished for doing) in the past. Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 2,395
The first three laws of behavior change‚Äîmake it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy‚Äîincrease the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change‚Äîmake it satisfying‚Äîincreases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the habit loop. But there is a trick. We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

You are constantly focused on the present or the very near future. You live in what scientists call an immediate-return environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,406
You live in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 2,407
The human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment. The earliest remains of modern humans,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,408
known as Homo sapiens sapiens, are approximately two hundred thousand years old.12 These were the first humans to have a brain relatively similar to ours. In particular, the neocortex‚Äîthe newest part of the brain and the region responsible for higher functions like language‚Äîwas roughly the same size two hundred thousand years ago as today. You are walking around with the same hardware as your Paleolithic ancestors.13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,413
the last five hundred years or so‚Äîthat society has shifted to a predominantly delayed-return environment.&lt;/p&gt;

The world has changed much in recent years, but human nature has changed little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,420
And after thousands of generations in an immediate-return environment, our brains evolved to prefer quick payoffs to long-term ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,421
Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency. That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time.fn2 You value the present more than the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,425
Why would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lung cancer? Why would someone overeat when they know it increases their&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,427
Once you understand how the brain prioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: the consequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are immediate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,431
Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately, these outcomes are often misaligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,434
‚ÄúIt almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa ‚Ä¶.18 Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,440
However, when the moment of decision arrives, instant gratification usually wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,446
Our preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth about success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification. If you‚Äôre willing to wait for the rewards, you‚Äôll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,450
People who are better at delaying gratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, and superior social skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,456
Thankfully, it‚Äôs possible to train yourself to delay gratification‚Äîbut you need to work with the grain of human nature, not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,457
against it. The best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,459
The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs in a small way. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid off and that the work was worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,466
What we‚Äôre really talking about here‚Äîwhen we‚Äôre discussing immediate rewards‚Äîis the ending of a behavior. The ending of any experience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,468
The best approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,469
Habit stacking, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start. Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,477
The immediate reward of seeing yourself save money toward the leather&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,478
jacket feels a lot better than being deprived. You are making it satisfying to do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,487
Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and reduced stress kick in, you‚Äôll become less concerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it because it‚Äôs who you are and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,492
In summary, a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. Simple bits of reinforcement‚Äîlike soap that smells great or toothpaste that has a refreshing mint flavor or seeing $50 hit your savings account‚Äîcan offer the immediate pleasure you need to enjoy a habit. And change is easy when it is enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,558
Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you‚Äôre focused on the process rather than the result. You‚Äôre not fixated on getting six-pack abs, you‚Äôre just trying to keep the streak alive and become the type of person who doesn‚Äôt miss workouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,560
In summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don‚Äôt want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,562
whenever you record another successful instance of your habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,562

If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible. ‚ñ† Just because you can measure something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the most important thing.&lt;/p&gt;

In general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and immediate the consequence, the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,684
more likely it is to influence individual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,685
Thankfully, there is a straightforward way to add an immediate cost to any bad habit: create a habit contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,809
choose the right field of competition. This is just as true with habit change as it is with sports and business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,810
Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. Like Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on the track, you want to play a game where the odds are in your favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,819
This is true not just for physical characteristics but for mental ones as well. I‚Äôm smart if you ask me about habits and human behavior; not so much when it comes to knitting, rocket propulsion, or guitar chords. Competence is highly dependent on context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,830
Indeed, beneath the surface of every behavior. Genes have been shown to influence everything from the number of hours you spend watching television to your likelihood to marry or divorce to your tendency to get addicted to drugs, alcohol, or nicotine.8 There‚Äôs a strong genetic component to how obedient or rebellious you are when facing authority, how vulnerable or resistant you are to stressful events, how proactive or reactive you tend to be, and even how captivated or bored you feel during sensory experiences like attending a concert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,835
Robert Plomin,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,835
King‚Äôs College in London, told me, ‚ÄúIt is now at the point where we have stopped testing to see if traits have a genetic component because we literally can‚Äôt find a single one that isn‚Äôt influenced by our genes.‚Äù10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,839
The most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the ‚ÄúBig Five,‚Äù which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,840
Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other. Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs.¬†introverts). Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,850
natural antidepressant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,852
As a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a personality trait all people possess to various degrees. People who are high in neuroticism tend to be anxious and worry more than others. This trait has been&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,853
linked to hypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain responsible for noticing threats.14 In other words, people who are more sensitive to negative cues in their environment are more likely to score high in neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,872
Learning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful. In theory, you can enjoy almost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the things that come easily to you. People who are talented in a particular area tend to be more competent at that task and are then praised for doing a good job. They stay energized because they are making progress where others have failed, and because they get rewarded with better pay and bigger opportunities, which not only makes them happier but also propels them to produce even higher-quality work. It‚Äôs a virtuous cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,877
Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,878
In many cases, when people pick the wrong habit, it simply means they picked a habit that was too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,882
The most common approach is trial and error. Of course, there‚Äôs a problem with this strategy: life is short. You don‚Äôt have time to try every career, date every eligible bachelor, or play every musical instrument. Thankfully, there is an effective way to manage this conundrum, and it is known as the explore/exploit trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,885
activity, there should be a period of exploration. In relationships, it‚Äôs called dating. In college, it‚Äôs called the liberal arts. In business, it‚Äôs called split testing. The goal is to try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,890
In the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent. Google famously asks employees to spend 80 percent of the workweek on their official job and 20 percent on projects of their choice, which has led to the creation of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,892
blockbuster products like AdWords and Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,897
As you explore different options, there are a series of questions you can ask yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,899
What feels like fun to me, but work to others? The mark of whether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,900
When are you enjoying yourself while other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 2,900
people are complaining? The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,901
What makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades away.19 This blend of happiness and peak performance is what athletes and performers experience when they are ‚Äúin the zone.‚Äù It is nearly impossible to experience a flow state and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,905
Where do I get greater returns than the average person? We are continually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a behavior is more likely to be satisfying when the comparison is in our favor. When I started writing at jamesclear.com, my email list grew very quickly. I wasn‚Äôt quite sure what I was doing well, but I knew that results seemed to be coming faster for me than&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,908
for some of my colleagues, which motivated me to keep writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,909
What comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, ‚ÄúWhat feels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?‚Äù No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,913
To be honest, some of this process is just luck. Michael Phelps and Hicham El Guerrouj were lucky to be born with a rare set of abilities that are highly valued by society and to be placed in the ideal environment for those abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,916
If you can‚Äôt find a game where the odds are stacked in your favor, create one. Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, says, ‚ÄúEveryone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort.20 In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I‚Äôm hardly an artist. And I‚Äôm not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I‚Äôm funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It‚Äôs the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,922
When you can‚Äôt win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,925
their weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,929
Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the ‚Äúaccident‚Äù of bad genetics. The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,931
strength. Even if you‚Äôre not the most naturally gifted, you can often win by being the best in a very narrow category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,932
Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can‚Äôt control whether you‚Äôre a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where it‚Äôs better to be hard or soft. If you can find a more favorable environment, you can transform the situation from one where the odds are against you to one where they are in your favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,936
Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on. Once we realize our strengths, we know where to spend our time and energy. We know which types of opportunities to look for and which types of challenges to avoid. The better we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,940
fulfilling your own potential than comparing yourself to someone else. The fact that you have a natural limit to any specific ability has nothing to do with whether you are reaching the ceiling of your capabilities. People get so caught up in the fact that they have limits that they rarely exert the effort required to get close to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,942
Furthermore, genes can‚Äôt make you successful if you‚Äôre not doing the work. Yes, it‚Äôs possible that the ripped trainer at the gym has better genes, but if you haven‚Äôt put in the same reps, it‚Äôs impossible to say if you have been dealt a better or worse genetic hand. Until you work as hard as those you admire, don‚Äôt explain away their success as luck. In summary, one of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills. Work hard on the things that come easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,948
The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. ‚ñ† Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle. ‚ñ† Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. ‚ñ† Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you. ‚ñ† Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can‚Äôt find a game that favors you, create one. ‚ñ† Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,980
While there is still much to learn, one of the most consistent findings is that the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of ‚Äújust manageable difficulty.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 2,982
The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty. If you love tennis and try to play a serious match against a four-year-old, you will quickly become bored. It‚Äôs too easy. You‚Äôll win every point. In contrast, if you play a professional tennis player like Roger Federer or Serena Williams, you will quickly lose motivation because the match is too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,988
The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,993
When you‚Äôre starting a new habit, it‚Äôs important to keep the behavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it even when conditions aren‚Äôt perfect. This is an idea we covered in detail while discussing the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,003
A flow state is the experience of being ‚Äúin the zone‚Äù and fully immersed in an activity. Scientists have tried to quantify this feeling. They found that to achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current ability.5 In real life it‚Äôs typically not feasible to quantify the difficulty of an action in this way, but the core idea of the Goldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just manageable difficulty‚Äîsomething on the perimeter of your ability‚Äîseems crucial for maintaining motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 3,007
Improvement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularly search for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make enough progress to stay motivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without variety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self-improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,015
He mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he said something I wasn‚Äôt expecting: ‚ÄúAt some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,017
His answer surprised me because it‚Äôs a different way of thinking about work ethic. People talk about getting ‚Äúamped up‚Äù to work on their goals. Whether it‚Äôs business or sports or art, you hear people say things like, ‚ÄúIt all comes down to passion.‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúYou have to really want it.‚Äù As a result, many of us get depressed when we lose focus or motivation because we think that successful people have some bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was saying that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,020
really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,025
The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,029
As Machiavelli noted, ‚ÄúMen desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,033
In psychology, this is known as a variable reward.7 fn2 Slot machines are the most common real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpot every now and then but not at any predictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. This variance leads to the greatest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,036
spike of dopamine, enhances memory recall, and accelerates habit formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 3,037
Variable rewards won‚Äôt create a craving‚Äîthat is, you can‚Äôt take a reward people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval, and hope it will change their mind‚Äîbut they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings we already experience because they reduce boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 3,043
Of course, not all habits have a variable reward component, and you wouldn‚Äôt want them to. If Google only delivered a useful search result some of the time, I would switch to a competitor pretty quickly. If Uber only picked up half of my trips, I doubt I‚Äôd be using that service much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 3,050
I can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking to it, there will be days when you feel like quitting. When you start a business, there will be days when you don‚Äôt feel like showing up. When you‚Äôre at the gym, there will be sets that you don‚Äôt feel like finishing. When it‚Äôs time to write, there will be days that you don‚Äôt feel like typing. But stepping up when it‚Äôs annoying or painful or draining to do so, that‚Äôs what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,054
Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,056
David Cain, an author and meditation teacher, encourages his students to avoid being ‚Äúfair-weather meditators.‚Äù Similarly, you don‚Äôt want to be a fair-weather athlete or a fair-weather writer or a fair-weather anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 3,057
When a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 3,058
Professionals take action even when the mood isn‚Äôt right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 3,060
There have been a lot of articles I haven‚Äôt felt like writing, but I‚Äôve never regretted publishing on schedule. There have been a lot of days I‚Äôve felt like relaxing, but I‚Äôve never regretted showing up and working on something that was important to me. The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.&lt;/p&gt;

I will hazard a prediction. When you are 80 years old and in a quiet moment of reflection, narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your life‚Äôs story, the telling that will be most compact and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made. In the end, we are our choices. ‚ÄîJeff Bezos, 2010 Princeton Commencement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 71
Now look ahead. Before long, all public and private communication‚Äîentertainment, news, music, sports, social media, online searches‚Äîwill be ad-free, leaving sides of buses as the publicity medium of last resort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 73
Millennials, that vital under-forty market, are not only banishing advertising from their lives but sneering at the institution itself, denouncing its bragging and promising as deceitful, manipulative, the next thing to micro-aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 79
In 2015, 76 percent of marketers surveyed by Adobe claimed that marketing had changed more in the last two years than it had in all the decades since the birth of television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 80
Many chief marketing officers swear they will never again trust advertising to deliver customers. Some CMOs condemn ad agencies for wasting time and money trying to be Super Bowl‚Äìcreative instead of market-effective. Others blame the noise from free online ads that drowns out their paid ads. Still others complain that falling return on investment (ROI) and rising costs make advertising just too damn expensive. Of course, if advertising suddenly redelivered the mass consumers of decades past, all would be forgiven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 84
The more the push strategies of bragging and promising lose traction, the more marketers turn to the pull tactics of effective storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 85
To support their efforts, the Harvard Business Review has published dozens of articles on the persuasive power of story for both leadership and branding, a myriad of TED talks have championed the neuroscience behind storified messaging, and how-to writers have poured out dozens upon dozens of story-in-business manuals that could fill a wall at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 90
but overall, corporate storytelling continues to sputter and stumble in confusion, more a trend than a tool.&lt;/p&gt;

results. The difference between data and story is this: Data lists what happened; story expresses how and why it happened. Data compiles facts by quantity and frequency; story reveals the causalities behind and beneath those facts. Story eliminates irrelevancies, concentrates on dynamic change, and then reshapes factual subject matter into a structure that links events into chains of cause and effect, played out over time.&lt;/p&gt;

Pennsylvania Gazette filled with ads, the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 269
If they created ads that&lt;/p&gt;

Not only do consumers object to interruption, but they hate being played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 290
Classical marketing theory asserts this premise: Human beings are rational decision makers who, when faced with an important choice, gather relevant facts, weigh alternatives, then choose the best option. Therefore, to persuade consumers, present your claims in a factual, logical, scientific manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 293
Rhetoric imitates science by presenting evidence and drawing a conclusion, but the difference is that science weighs all evidence, both for and against a theorem; rhetoric slants its argument by laying out only the evidence that supports its claim,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 295
science seeks the truth; rhetoric seeks the win. Marketing, in essence, is a public forum for rhetorical debate, a platform to persuade the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 296
consumer that one product‚Äôs features outperform another‚Äôs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 300
Do you remember where you learned to use rhetorical persuasion? How to argue using inductive and deductive logic? Writing junior high school essays. Do you remember your seventh-grade syllogism lesson?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 308
As the savvy prospective buyer scans the chart, he knows two things: (1) The company self-selected only those categories in which its brand scores best. (2) Categories in which the product scored worse than the competition were left off the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 310
Now more than ever, marketing via rhetorical argument provokes skepticism in the mind of the customer and a negative attitude toward your product or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 322
If the inductive logic of rhetoric delivers suboptimized marketing results, why do businesses still gravitate toward it? First, education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 326
Second, the prestige of science. Business leaders strive for scientific planning and choice making, for predictability and precision.&lt;/p&gt;

The fundamental problems never change: how to capture attention, hold it, and reward it; in short, how to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 329
turn people on, not off. 2. Emotional Communication&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 330
At the heart of an effective creative philosophy is the belief that nothing is so powerful as an insight into human nature, what compulsions drive a man, what instincts dominate his action, even though his language so often camouflages what really motivates him. ‚ÄîBill Bernbach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 337
According to one biography, Bernbach spoke to clients ‚Äú.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äânot of advertising, but the art of persuasion. To persuade the consumer, the creators of ads needed to touch people‚Äôs basic, unchanging instincts‚Äîtheir ‚Äòobsessive drive to survive, to be admired, to succeed, to love, to take care of their own.‚Äô‚Äù4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 340
The first step to mastering emotional manipulation is to realize that there are only two primary emotions, pleasure and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 348
As Paul Bloom, professor of psychology and behavioral science at Yale, explains in his book How Pleasure Works, ‚ÄúWhat matters most is not the world as it appears to our senses. Rather, the enjoyment (or suffering) we get from something derives from what we think that thing is.‚Äù7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 351
Bloom claims that we are essentialists. Our response is conditioned by our beliefs of what things really are, what their essential nature is.8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 357
But the Caltech study used an fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) device to observe the volunteers‚Äô brain activity. The imaging revealed that when the participants drank what they believed to be a more expensive wine, the region of the brain linked to pleasure lit up.9 It wasn‚Äôt snobbery. They actually enjoyed greater&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 360
pleasure from the wines they believed were more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 365
The finding: Participants who believed they were shocked intentionally felt the shocks more painfully, and the pain lingered throughout the study. Those who believed that the shocks were unintentional experienced less pain and a quicker recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

For both pleasure and pain, the meaning of the perception, not the sensory experience alone, determines how much pleasure or pain people experience. Because pleasure and pain are great motivators, creating these experiences within an ad promised to be marketing‚Äôs most powerful tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 369
Unfortunately, however, this insight devolved into the techniques of seduction and coercion. Seduction entices someone to do something with the promise of pleasure; coercion persuades&lt;/p&gt;

In short, story is the ultimate I.T. I in that storytelling demands information‚Äîa wide and deep knowledge of human nature and its relationship with the social and physical realms. T in that a well-told story demands skillful execution of its inner technology, its mechanisms of action/reaction, changing value charges, roles, conflicts, turning points, emotional dynamics, and much more. A craft underpins the art. Story structure, as we‚Äôll see in the next chapter, is intrinsic to the human mind. Why then do we need to learn its craft? Isn‚Äôt storytelling natural? By the same token, children can sketch stick figures. Isn‚Äôt drawing also natural? Yes, both are, but to achieve excellence, authors and painters move beyond instinct to experiment and master their craft anew.&lt;/p&gt;

Prior to self-awareness, our Pliocene ancestors, like all animals, lived in the corporeal comfort of a perpetual present. But when the sense of I am separated self-awareness from its primal instincts, visions of a painful future streaked through the newly minted human mind.6 What‚Äôs more, the mind discovered that not only is the future in doubt, but the surfaces of people and things cannot be trusted; that nothing is what it seems.

The mind, of course, does not convert every trivial change to story. Instead evolution has taught us to focus on meaningful, dynamic change. Storified thought interprets every event in terms of its core value. In story creation, however, the word value does not refer to mono-concepts such as success, truth, loyalty, love, or freedom. Those words name only half a value. Dynamic events affect our lives not as singularities but as binaries of positive/negative value charge. They pivot our lives around experiences of success/failure, truth/lie, loyalty/betrayal, love/hate, right/wrong, rich/poor,‚Ä¶

For an event to be meaningful, the mind must sense that the charge of at least one value has undergone change.

&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 494
Thanks to storied thought, humanity learned how to survive with purpose and balance. As Kenneth Burke put it, story equips us to live.12 THE EIGHT POWERS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 498
Self-Awareness: The power to distinguish the mind‚Äôs subjective, core self from its objective, public self and observe the outer self as if it were a separate personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 507
For the storyteller, other-awareness guides the creation of the characters that make the choices and take the actions that carry out the story. 3. Memory: The power to store and recall experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 509
The past makes the future in this way: Memory builds an understanding of people and the world by recording patterns of experience, stacking them one on top of another by what they have in common, and then telling itself, ‚ÄúThis is how the world works.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 511
The mind then uses these patterns from the past in an effort to control the future by taking actions designed to make history repeat itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 515
4. Intelligence: The power to extract knowledge from both formal learning and everyday experience, and then apply deductive, inductive, and causal logics to reason to factual, truthful conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 518
Imagination: The power to reshape reality into undreamed-of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 522
Insight: The power to see through appearances and perceive inner causalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 522
An insightful mind reads surface signs and then senses the hidden forces that move within and cause things to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 523
Data, for example, only measures the outer results of what has changed; insight discovers how and why what has changed has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 524
The storyteller, as we will see, uses this keen perspective to show us a world we think we understand, but then cracks open reality to first surprise us, then deliver a rush of insight into the hows and whys of that world and its characters. A lifetime of story-driven insights civilizes human beings, builds institutions, and makes culture viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 527
Correlation: The power to create. The correlating mind takes two things it already knows, and then seeks a hidden connection, a third thing that joins the two in a way no one else has ever seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 533
Self-Expression: The power to perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 540
The mind builds stories to bridge the gap between itself and the universe, between itself and the past, present, and future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 541
Story form imposes order on chaos;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 541
seems to express the cause and effect of the is; it unifies events to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 542
Knowledge expressed in story form gathers other human beings around its themes, uniting communities and building cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 543
So, in the marketing context, the takeaway is this: Storified communication is the most powerful form of messaging because story fits the mind; story fits the mind because the mind converts actuality into story in the first place. It‚Äôs a tautology. As Hamlet says, ‚ÄúThere is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 553
Story, like art and music, is a word you think you understand until you try to define it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 556
Reference books offer little help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 561
Let‚Äôs clarify what story is by first looking at what it is not and eliminating any weak synonyms or false equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 562
STORY IS NOT A PROCESS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 565
But unlike a story, a process has neither a desire nor a conflict nor a core character. As a result, no one‚Äôs life is touched or changed. A process accumulates; a story progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 566
STORY IS NOT A HIERARCHY&lt;/p&gt;

For them, the corporate ‚Äústory‚Äù describes how things get done, how decisions and tasks flow up and down the pyramid of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 573
STORY IS NOT A JOURNEY&lt;/p&gt;

society. But the protagonist of a well-told story is not a passive passenger; she struggles dynamically through&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 577
time and space to fulfill her desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 578
STORY IS NOT A NARRATIVE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 578
Many marketing campaigns have flopped because an ad agency didn‚Äôt know the difference between narrative and story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 581
All stories are narratives, but not all narratives are stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 581
Narratives tend to be flat, bland, repetitive, and boring recitations of events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 582
They slide through the mind like juice through a goose, and as a result, they have little or no influence on customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 583
Stories, on the other hand, are value-charged and progressive. The mind embraces a well-told story; the imagination is its natural home. Once through our mental door, story fits, sticks, and excites consumer choice. The next time you‚Äôre bored to the bone by somebody‚Äôs ‚Äústory,‚Äù in all likelihood you‚Äôre not being told a story. If you were, you‚Äôd be listening and engrossed. Instead the guy is torturing you with a narrative, probably a repetitious recitation of ‚Äú.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâand then I did this and then I did that and then I did the other thing and then and then and then‚Ä¶‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 588
What is a story, precisely? The essential core event in all stories ever told in the history of humanity can be expressed in just three words: Conflict changes life. Therefore, the prime definition becomes: a dynamic escalation of conflict-driven events that cause meaningful change in a character‚Äôs life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 599
As with the arts of music and dance, the primary dimension of a story is time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 604
Before an author composes his story, he needs a clear vision of his audience and the final effect his work will have on both their thoughts and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

the specific rational effect the storytellers aimed for was a deep understanding of the hows and whys behind the events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 608
Their specific target of meaningful emotional satisfaction was the calm sense of gratification that comes when a quiet hero beats the odds&lt;/p&gt;

from behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 609
STAGE TWO: SUBJECT MATTER PRIME PRINCIPLE: BALANCE A story takes place at a specific time in a specific physical and social world. As the telling begins, the PROTAGONIST‚Äôs life is anchored in a core value that rests in a state of balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 615
The core value in Beane‚Äôs career‚Äîsuccess/failure‚Äîrests in balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 616
STAGE THREE: THE INCITING INCIDENT PRIME PRINCIPLE: IMBALANCE The inciting incident is an unforeseen event that starts the story by upsetting the balance of the core character‚Äôs life. The neutral charge of its core value turns sharply positive or negative. Either way, this radical change puts the character under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 620
This inciting incident turns the balance of Beane‚Äôs life sharply to the positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 621
MONEYBALL‚Äôs inciting incident, however, also brings an unfortunate side effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 625
STAGE FOUR: THE OBJECT OF DESIRE PRIME PRINCIPLE: AN UNFULFILLED NEED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 626
When the CORE CHARACTER senses that the inciting incident has thrown his life out of balance and into jeopardy, he naturally wants to set life back on an even keel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 633
STAGE SIX: THE FIRST REACTION PRIME PRINCIPLE: THE VIOLATION OF EXPECTATION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 637
The Oakland A‚Äôs lose twenty-six of their first forty-six games. Art Howe attacks sabermetrics as a failure, and against Beane‚Äôs wishes, he fields the lineup he wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 639
STAGE SEVEN: THE CRISIS CHOICE PRIME PRINCIPLE: INSIGHT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 641
a second action that‚Äôs more difficult, more risky than the first, yet one he hopes will cause a positive reaction that will finally get him what he wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 642
MONEYBALL: Beane trades away Howe‚Äôs star first baseman to force the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 643
team manager to use Brand‚Äôs sabermetric choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 644
In a compact story, the protagonist‚Äôs second action causes a climactic reaction that matches his expectations and grants him his object of desire. This climax restores the core character‚Äôs life to balance and ends the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 648
Eight Stages of Story Design Stage One: Target Audience = A Meaningful Emotional Effect Stage Two: Subject Matter = Balance Stage Three: Inciting Incident = Imbalance Stage Four: Object of Desire = Need Stage Five: First Action = Tactical Choice Stage Six: First Reaction = Violation of Expectation Stage Seven: Crisis Choice = Insight Stage Eight: Climactic Reaction = Closure&lt;/p&gt;

Most marketing uses brief, compact stories. In the practical world of business, the brevity of advertising time, along with the high costs of creatives and production, confines marketing stories to one or two turning points. MEANING&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 682
First, at the core of all stories pulses at least one binary value‚Äîsuch as life/death, freedom/tyranny, success/failure, truth/lie, love/hate, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 686
Second, the dynamic of cause and effect within the story‚Äôs events expresses the hows and whys,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 700
Writers of fiction for page, stage, and screen have little difficulty imagining their story‚Äôs buying public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 703
At the end of the day, the professional writer judges his quality of work not by its effect on him, but by the degree to which the effect he hoped for affects his readers or audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 708
Subject matter for a story contains three major components: a physical and social setting, a protagonist, and a core value. Life offers the storyteller an infinite variety of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 710
In fact, more often than not, the spark of originality that ignites an exceptional story flashes through a creative‚Äôs imagination not while she daydreams, but as she sweats out the grunt work of founding her story-world and planting its setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 712
World-building, therefore, is storytelling‚Äôs critical second step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 713
The weakest choices of all favor the general over the specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 716
The mind works best when it moves from the specific to the universal‚Äînot the other way around. Consider, for example, the phrase a piece of furniture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:Important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 718
particular. But if I say, ‚ÄúA wingback Duchess chair upholstered in blood-red leather,‚Äù a clear image glows in your mind. Instinctively, your imagination moves forward from this particular to the general, slotting the chair into the mental category ‚Äúfurniture.‚Äù This applies to all aspects of a story‚Äôs world, physical and social.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 720
Therefore, the principle: The more specific the setting, the more universal the story‚Äôs appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 731
(1) Physical‚Äîthe horizontal landscape and every object on it. (2) Social‚Äîthe vertical hierarchy of a society‚Äôs pyramid of power and the possibility for movement up or down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 736
Every physical setting contains a social setting as well, a cast of characters defined by demographic factors such as age, gender, income, employment, and ethnicity. What‚Äôs more, this cast lives in a culture defined first and foremost by its values‚Äîits ideality versus its reality, what its citizens believe they should do versus what in fact they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 739
THE CORE VALUE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 743
But for the story-maker, the values he invests in his telling come not as singularities but binaries of positive/negative charge: truth/lie, love/hate, generosity/selfishness, hard work/laziness, loyalty/betrayal, life/death, courage/cowardice, hope/despair, meaningfulness/meaninglessness, maturity/immaturity, justice/injustice, and on the list goes, naming all those qualities of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 745
human experience that can shift charge dynamically from positive to negative and back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 747
but it anchors its content in one irreplaceable binary‚Äîthe story‚Äôs core value. This value determines a story‚Äôs fundamental meaning and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 754
The core value that pulses at the heart of a story determines its specific meaning and unique emotional impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 761
A core character must be empathetic; she or he may or may not be sympathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 763
Empathetic means ‚Äúlike me‚Äù‚Äîan innate trait shared by both the core character and the target audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 764
Sympathy is optional, empathy essential, for this reason: Audience involvement hinges on an act of personal identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 765
Rather, the psychological bond of empathy only develops when an audience subconsciously identifies with a positive human quality emanating from within the character. This quality becomes the story‚Äôs center of good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 768
The moment a story appears in front of audience members or readers, they instantly and instinctively inspect its value-charged landscape, seeking an emotional door into the story, a place to stick their empathy. They sort the positives from the negatives, the goods from the bads, the rights from the wrongs, the things of value from the things of no value. Everyone searches for a center of good because, in his heart of hearts, everyone instinctively sees himself as good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 773
Therefore, all people, regardless of their humanity or lack of it, seek a positive glow somewhere in a story‚Äôs world, a mooring for their empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 774
Ideally, the storyteller places this center of good within the protagonist so that a positive human quality emanates from within the core character and captures the audience‚Äôs personal involvement. This empathy magnet also anchors the mirror story, which we will explain in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 779

Third, when curiosity over the MDQ merges with empathy for the protagonist, a story generates the compelling magnetism known as suspense. Suspense doubles involvement. This blend of subjective identification with objective wonder magnifies a story‚Äôs power tenfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 804
the inciting incident arouses the natural human desire to regain control and restore balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 806
and so conceives of an object of desire,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 806
This could be something physical like a hike in pay, a product innovation, or the right person&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 809
Nonetheless, all stories dramatize the essential human struggle to move life from chaos to order, from imbalance to equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 810
We measure the worth of the object of desire in terms of risk: the greater the risk, the greater the object‚Äôs worth. What would you risk your time for? What would you risk your life for? What would you risk your soul for? The most compelling objects of desire come with the highest price tags, and the greater the object‚Äôs worth, the greater the involvement. Contrariwise, watching a character pursue something of no real value is the definition of boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 815
storytelling becomes the art of merging and organizing many streams of want into a flow of events that aims at a single object of desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 823
These desires not only cement the status quo of a character‚Äôs life but also temper his behavior. Background desires form the web of restraints that follow every character into every scene. These fixed desires for stability limit the character‚Äôs actions, restraining what he may or may not say or do to get what he wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 826
Desire answers what questions: What does the character consciously want? What does he subconsciously long for? Motivation answers why questions. Why does a character want what he wants? Why does he want his particular object of desire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 828
The roots of human motivation reach deep into childhood and, for that reason, are often irrational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 830
Biographers of historical figures‚ÄîCharles Darwin, Eleanor Roosevelt, Picasso‚Äîdevote chapter upon chapter detailing the upbringing of each, trying to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 831
document the precise childhood experiences that motivated these personages to do the great things they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 832
Shakespeare, on the other hand, never mentions motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 834
STAGE FIVE: THE FIRST ACTION PRIME PRINCIPLE: TACTICAL CHOICE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 835
Desire demands deeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 836
This positive/negative dynamic propels his story to climax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 838
Every human being acts from one moment to the next on his personal sense of probability, on what he feels will probably happen when he does what he intends to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 843
From his quiver of personal tactics, he draws strategic behaviors, all in an effort to move toward his desire of the moment and long-term hopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 844
And because, like everyone else, he is one of a kind, his sense of what will probably happen when he takes an action will also be one of a kind; therefore, his choice of tactic (exact words, gestures, facial expressions, and so on) will, in turn, be one of a kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 847
It‚Äôs this infinitude of idiosyncratic tactics that inspires storytellers to imagine unique characters, the sort found in the best-told stories, with behaviors like no one else‚Äôs, behaviors that fascinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 849
Evolution programmed the genes of every living thing to conserve life down to the last calorie of energy, take no uncalled-for risks, and yet pursue all necessary desires. Therefore, human nature, as a part of Mother Nature, always takes the conservative, minimal, and yet sufficient action in an effort to get what it wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 853
A character will never do less than she has to, nor will she ever do more than she needs to; instead, she will take the minimal, conservative, yet sufficient action that she believes will move her closer to a balanced life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 856
Ninety-nine percent of our actions cause the responses we more or less expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 859
To create a meaningful emotional experience for his audience, the storyteller evicts all empty moments, all trivialities and banalities, and embraces those events, and only those events, that bring value-charged change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 860
To create value-charged change, the storyteller pits the core character‚Äôs sense of probability against reality‚Äôs forces of necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 867
When a character‚Äôs world suddenly reacts differently and/or more powerfully than he imagined, this violation of expectation delivers a jolt of surprise, followed by a rush of insight. The clash between what he thinks will happen and the result he actually gets jolts him and splits open his reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 869
The character stares, as it were, into the gap between his subjective anticipation and its objective result. Then with a rush of insight, he suddenly glimpses how his world actually works; how its unforeseen forces of antagonism now block his path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 873
When an unanticipated, even contradictory, obstacle violates a protagonist‚Äôs expectations, it moves him farther from his object of desire than he was before he acted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 887
Inner Obstacles: Contradictory forces within a character‚Äôs body, emotions, and mind with its warring conscious and subconscious desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 891
To turn a scene means to change its value charge; the phrase turning point names the precise moment when an unforeseen force of antagonism violates expectations and pivots the value at stake from positive to negative or negative to positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 893
Turning points trigger change in only one of two ways‚Äîeither by a direct action followed by the reaction it sparks, or by a revelation of a secret or previously unknown fact and the response it unleashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 898
The Rational Effects of TURNING POINTS A violation of expectation is, in essence, an effect with an unknown cause. As a result, turning points pop questions into the mind such as ‚ÄúWhy have things taken this unforeseen turn? Why didn‚Äôt the character see this coming? Why didn‚Äôt I? What caused this startling twist?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 901
A turning point punches a hole in reality. Curiosity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 901
compels the audience members to fill the hole with knowledge, so their thoughts rush back through previous scenes and images, looking for an unseen cause, trying to solve the mystery of ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù The answer has been planted beneath the story‚Äôs setups. The moment the audience glimpses this hidden truth, it erupts with an ‚ÄúOh, yeah, now I get it!‚Äù insight that both delights and enlightens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 911
As Aristotle observed, the deepest audience pleasure is learning without being taught. When a tale dramatizes its meaning skillfully, the audience feels no mental strain and yet comes away with a fuller understanding of the workings of the world and the human heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 916
the like. The mind‚Äôs ranking process keys on the potential for change. So long as life‚Äôs conditions run in neutral, the mind pays no attention and goes about its many tasks. But when things change, awareness snaps to alert as our animal instincts warn us that change threatens survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 922
Emotion, therefore, is the side effect of change. When the mind senses change from negative to positive, it releases pleasure-giving chemicals; if the mind registers a movement from positive to negative, it unleashes a painful flow.&lt;/p&gt;

Ad Age named ‚ÄúReal Beauty‚Äù one of the top five ad campaigns of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 928
In 2013, Hugo Veiga created a video titled Dove Real Beauty Sketches.2 The story follows a group of women who volunteer for an odd experiment: They agree to have their portrait done by a sketch artist who cannot see them. Instead they will simply tell him what they look like. This act of courage immediately draws empathy from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 936
The above graphic tracks the emotional dynamics in the Dove Real Beauty Sketches video. Its turning points swivel between the opposing poles of its core value, from self-criticism to self-appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 946
The story climaxes on the doubly positive charge of self-appreciation. During this decisive transition, the audience shares in the women‚Äôs triumph over self-criticism and feels, with them, a positive emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 948
All well-told stories express how and why life changes, and, as we noted above,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 948
the side effect of change is emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 949
These feelings, however, only come to life during a transition. As a story shifts from positive to negative, the audience feels a dark emotion; as it transitions from negative to positive, a light emotion fills them. Once change completes itself, however, emotion quickly dissipates, ready to move in a new direction. To grip and hold emotional involvement, a story‚Äôs values must transition dynamically from change to change to change.&lt;/p&gt;

Faced with an array of possible actions, she must choose one last tactic in a final effort to put life back in balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 958
Decisions come in two kinds: clear choices versus dilemmas‚Äîthe easy versus the hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 960
Clear choices obey nature‚Äôs grand imperative: Always choose the positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 961
Every living thing, flora and fauna, instinctively heeds the two laws governing the conservation of energy and life: (1) Never do anything you don‚Äôt have to do if you can get what you want the easier way. (2) Never take any risk you don‚Äôt have to take if you can get what you want the safer way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 968
Dilemmas also come in two kinds, and both are hard because they pose a choice between either two positives or two negatives, known respectively as irreconcilable goods and the lesser of two evils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 972
The hard choice of dilemma causes anxiety before the choice and risk during it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 975
But as we‚Äôll see in the next chapter, in the marketer‚Äôs purpose-told story, the protagonist‚Äôs climactic choice must be pressure-and stress-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,013
Unlike full-length fictions, purpose-told stories abbreviate events. The typical business story is a mini-tale told in a thirty-second commercial or a three-minute YouTube video. GE‚Äôs ‚ÄúOwen‚Äù ads and the Dove Real Beauty Sketches are two perfect examples of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,016
The marketing story, no. Purpose-told works crack open the gap between expectation and result usually only once, perhaps twice, maybe three times at the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,028
The purpose-told‚Äôs audience members take their storified experience into the real world and relive it each and every time they purchase the subject product or service. In other words, the purpose of the purpose-told story is to transform the aesthetic pleasure of a story‚Äôs climax into a viable action in the marketplace‚Äîto turn audiences into consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,032
we gain an insight into life we never knew before, all enveloped in emotions we never felt quite that way before. This fusion of idea and emotion adds a measure of enrichment, great or small, to our inner life. We exit a beautifully told story a fuller human being than when we entered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,035
The fiction-told story fulfills itself in one telling, whereas the purpose-told story retells its tale in the mind of the consumer each and every time she buys its product or hires its service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,038
Concentrated experiences entertain because they carry us through time unaware of the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,047
The audience of the purpose-told story, on the other hand, ignores the artist and feels brand loyalty instead. Brand loyalty, and the lifetime of purchases that comes with it, is created by the mirror experience at the heart of the purpose-told story. THE MIRROR EXPERIENCE Well-told stories create two simultaneous experiences that mirror each other: one mental, the other emotional. The mental mirror experience begins and ends with curiosity. A story‚Äôs inciting incident teases the audience‚Äôs mind with unanswered questions such as ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going to happen next? What‚Äôll happen after that? How will this story turn out? Will the protagonist win his object of desire?‚Äù The rational mirror experience in story mirrors the same set&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,059
First, the identification. The moment the target consumer recognizes a shared humanity between herself and the protagonist, her instincts follow the logic of kinship: ‚ÄúThat character is a human being like me. Therefore, I want that character to get what he wants, because if I were that character in that situation, I would want the same thing for myself.‚Äù In other words, she bonds.2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,065
She instinctively experiences the events as if they were happening to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,067
Third, the reenactment. The consumer‚Äôs mirror experience motivates her to act. Wishing to relive the positive charge of the purpose-told story, she purchases the product or hires the service embedded in the telling. Her post-story reenactment satisfies her need and the marketer‚Äôs purpose simultaneously. In short, she becomes a customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,074
The mind memorizes the patterns of cause and effect that underlie real-life past events so it can strategize its future actions. As events impact us over the years, we gather knowledge of how things work, how the various forces in our world interconnect. When new situations arise, the mind draws on these past patterns to imagine the possible tactics it might take and predict the probable reactions these actions might cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,077
This process of linking previous encounters to future outcomes underlies not only factual but also fictional experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,082
Each person acts on her unique sense of probability, what her sum total of personal experience, actual and fictional, tells her will probably happen when she chooses to act.&lt;/p&gt;

Consider, for example, the storified marketing campaign that saved a brand from virtual extinction, ‚ÄúReal Beauty‚Äù by Dove. As we demonstrated in the emotion-creation section of the previous chapter, this insight into the target audience‚Äôs inciting incident and resulting object of desire inspired Ogilvy &amp;amp; Mather to weave a purpose-told story around the core value of self-criticism versus self-appreciation.

This logic, as painful experience teaches, is fallacious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,161
fact, for many business stories, the only logical choice for protagonist is a product or a corporation. If so, the tale must be told from that point of view. To do so, however, the storyteller faces this challenging problem: How can I fuse an empathetic connection between consumer and protagonist when the latter is either an inanimate object or an impersonal institution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,168
Fantasy worlds and characters demand imagination, innovation, and creative execution. Rather than face that task, many campaigns abandon storytelling in favor of a spokesperson bragging and making promises the product‚Äôs performance may or may not be able to keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,172
To turn a corporation into an empathetic protagonist, the marketer first must identify the company‚Äôs primal value, a value so essential to its nature that if it were lost, the company would disappear with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,234

&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,274
How does this object of desire relate to the core value (for example, just/unjust or rich/poor) of the story? And by extension, how does the story‚Äôs core value relate to my company‚Äôs core value? Your answers need not match perfectly, but they cannot be divorced. Values and desires must reflect each other and thus unify the story with the company that produces it.&lt;/p&gt;

Developing a compelling story means developing a conflict that relates to your audience, mirroring the positive/negative duality of their lives. Think about it. Life fills our hours with problems to be solved, needs to be met, desires to be satisfied‚Äînot enough time to get the job done, too far to go to get what you need, a romance on the rocks, an illness that resists cure.&lt;/p&gt;

First: as mentioned, the business school dictum to protect your brand from any and all criticism. Second: the super-sensitive people of today‚Äôs hyper-protective culture who find unpleasant truths intimidating. Third: people who want to cover their asses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,332
To preempt blame, marketing executives cover their butts by outlawing the least hint of anything negative in their ads. As an unfortunate result, negaphobia not only distorts their business judgment, but also sucks the impact out of their messaging.&lt;/p&gt;

A compelling marketing story encompasses the negative of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,335
And the story must establish its negative floor either in Stage Two, when the inciting incident imbalances the protagonist‚Äôs life, or here in Stage Six as the story‚Äôs forces of antagonism suddenly react against the protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;

This surprise instantly pops the question ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù into the mind of character and audience alike. Curiosity drives them to look more deeply into the story‚Äôs society and setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,339
Consumers love to realize the truth in this spontaneous, storified way. They want to be shown, not told. They don‚Äôt want to sit in a classroom; they want a surprising living discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,340
This insight puts the consumer‚Äôs mirror story on a path to solution and the satisfaction of her need. She doesn‚Äôt know how it will be done, but it‚Äôs out there, so she can‚Äôt look away. This curiosity holds your prospect‚Äôs attention, even in a world of constant distraction. Marketing stories are generally brief. The protagonist pursues her object of desire through usually only one turning point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,348
Stage Seven brings the story to its crisis, the highest level of tension and suspense. The protagonist, based on her new knowledge, chooses a new tactic, one she hopes will create a reaction from her world that will deliver her object of desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,350
At this point in most fiction-told stories, the protagonist stands in dilemma, forced to choose between either two irreconcilable positive possibilities or two equally repugnant negative choices. Never in a marketing story. Rather, the insight the protagonist gained in Stage Six now gives her a clear choice of what to do to get what she wants. She conceives her new tactic and takes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,354
‚ÄúHow will this turn out?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,358
Stage Eight delivers the goods. The protagonist‚Äôs second action evokes a positive reaction from his world, giving him his object of desire and reestablishing the balance of his life.&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúDecember 21st‚Äù ends with a final twist. Before the son can break the truth to the grandmother, she stops him, saying, ‚ÄúI know what you are going to say.‚Äù He sighs, thinking she has already figured it out and been let down. Instead she reaches into her pocket and hands him her ‚Äúwinning‚Äù lottery ticket, saying, ‚ÄúBut you should always listen to your mother. And I will be much happier if you have this.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,378
A story‚Äôs climax impacts the audience‚Äôs mind with a sudden rush of meaningful emotional insight, a flash of ‚ÄúI get it!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,380
Neuroscientists have measured this open-mind phenomenon and found that it lasts for six to eight seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:Neuroscience of getting the story&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,380
In this moment of wonder and pleasure, anything presented to the mind lodges in its memory. Therefore, this is the spot where the wise marketer plants his logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,382
That‚Äôs exactly what the Spanish lottery does at the end of their five-minute story, and beneath it they feature their tagline ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no bigger prize than sharing.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 1,384
The final effect of the open-mind moment turns the entire story into a massive call to action that sends the audience member out into the real world to duplicate the protagonist‚Äôs triumph. Wanting to relive the mirror story, she purchases the product or hires the service that‚Äôs at the heart of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

Now that we have reviewed the eight stages of story, it‚Äôs important to note that not every marketing story needs to take its audience through all eight stages explicitly. The mind, as we noted, is a story-taking and -making machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,388
One key phrase or image may imply an entire story, as the audience‚Äôs mind instantly imagines the unexpressed stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,389

Well, I‚Äôm no Steve Jobs‚Ä¶ but I also think the two essential roles of the marketer are conducting the corporate orchestra and setting the North Star vision‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,424
Today the CMO occupies a new, critical, and far broader role in the company than ever before: change agent. THE CMO AS CHANGE AGENT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,428
Your first task as change agent is to educate your executive team on the worldwide shift from ad-centric to story-centric marketing. No small task. Conventional C-suite wisdom holds that six-year-olds crave stories, while hard-charging executives don‚Äôt. But you know that if your company doesn‚Äôt change its MO, it won‚Äôt survive, so you must build a winning case to convince the C-suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,434
Once your executives are on board with the concept, teach the eight stages of story creation to sales, marketing, product development, communications, investor relations, and leadership at all corporate levels. Finally, to put storytelling into practice, coach your team to change their thinking habits in six decisive ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,437
Change your team‚Äôs analytical method from deductive logic to causal logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,445
Change the team‚Äôs sales practices from additive to progressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,453
Change the team‚Äôs worldview from narrow and shallow to wide and deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,462
Change your team‚Äôs understanding of values. Convincing storytelling depends on an authenticity of values. Therefore, a transformational&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,468
Change your team‚Äôs marketing theory to embrace emotional intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,470
The key to decision making is emotion, and emotion is not information. The emotionally targeted question you should ask is: ‚ÄúHow do I want my customers to feel?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,472
Your team members must frame their stories to create a feeling of fusion between protagonist and audience. When empathy seals the deal, use progressive conflict and value charge changes to hook and hold your audience, and finally reward it with a story climax that reinforces brand or product values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,474
Change the team‚Äôs mental model from static description to dynamic storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,481
As corporate showrunner, the modern CMO educates her team in story craft, produces a storytelling strategy for the brand, and operationalizes its storytelling processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,482
She recruits the right creatives, guides moment-by-moment storytelling to ensure brand/voice alignment, and exercises good taste to guarantee a quality experience for the brand‚Äôs prospective customers. It‚Äôs a big job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,487
Every CMO starts his day staring at this hard truth: Nobody wants to hear about your company or your product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,491
Typically, consumers only debate brands in the mental minute just before they make a purchase. That precious minute makes storified branding an imperative for modern marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,500
Brand is a single organizing idea, a higher-order construct that everything else comes from and aligns with. Sometimes I liken it to the fresh water that makes everything else possible, whether that is growing your crops or cleaning your clothes or making soup. It‚Äôs that ingredient that goes across everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,503
Finding a fresh source of water that won‚Äôt be depleted and can be used in hundreds and hundreds of ways is a challenge. Which is to say [brand] is intangible, it is abstract, and it is true. It has to be all of those things at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,505
The job of the marketer is to make it tangible and real and to work with its truth to tell a story that is compelling whether it happens in one image or three lines or a long-form piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,506
All of that is in service of saying we want brands to be a link between a number of positive associations for the consumer, and increasingly for communities and constituencies beyond the consumer, to say that we can all come together around this one big higher-order idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,508
It is a belief system, and like any belief system, it has its language, it has symbols, it has rituals, and behaviors to go with them.1&lt;/p&gt;

Those brands are all owned by the same company, and in fact, consumers may choose those brands at different points in their weekend, because they are conveying different aspects of their personality with that badge, with the beer bottle they are holding.‚Äù The brands we choose reflect how we see ourselves or, perhaps, how we want the world to see us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,514
Originally, Davis pointed out, brands were simply a means of identifying the producer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,515
The purpose of the brand was to show that a certain person had made that specific piece. Whether silver goods or porcelain or leather goods, wares were hallmarked by their maker (in effect, they were branded like cattle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,518
‚ÄúThe mark is just a shortcut, a signal for [the brand]. [The brand] still exists and survives beyond the product and beyond the mark and that‚Äôs when you get into some very interesting work.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,519
How can you create a brand that matters so much to people that they make it part of their self-expression? For generations, television advertising did the trick. Not anymore.

Overcoming skepticism is like overcoming gravity. It‚Äôs a natural force, buttressed by the endless bragging and over-promising of brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,564
The well-told story erases skepticism by wrapping the story‚Äôs meaning inside an emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,565
The source of this psychological power is empathic identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,565
Once an audience instinctively links its sense of self with a protagonist, doubt vanishes. The protagonist‚Äôs choices and actions become the audience‚Äôs vicarious choices and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

Like an epiphany, a story‚Äôs climactic action floods the mind with a sense of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,569
Because the audience member‚Äôs own thoughts spontaneously form this idea, she believes in it without rationalization or any hint of skepticism. It‚Äôs hers, after all. What‚Äôs more, the pleasure-filled emotion aroused by this sudden insight engraves the experience into her memory. From that day on, her upbeat remembrance surrounds the brand with a subliminal halo that influences her purchases. This is how stories, consistently told well, establish a meaningful brand in the minds of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,572
consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,573
Once you determine your audience (Stage One of the storytelling process), you must choose subject matter that contains a physical and social setting, a core value, and a protagonist (Stage Two). Subject matter possibilities for brands fall into at least five grand genres: origin, history, mission, product, and customer stories. You need a least one story to define your brand, but some brands tell thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,585
Once again, empathy. Genius-in-a-garage stories are as old as Thomas Edison. They touch the heart because they star the iconic American business hero: a young shoestring entrepreneur battling shortsighted prejudice and overwhelming odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,586
If your company has a powerful origin story, and the core value of that story aligns with your brand‚Äôs, make it the first story you tell to establish your brand in the minds of your consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

Red Bull‚Äôs market researchers first discovered that their die-hard customer is a young guy who loves extreme sports. Digging deeper, the executives asked, ‚ÄúWhat do our customers want to feel?‚Äù The answer came back: ‚ÄúFrenetic energy.‚Äù This insight led to their discovery of the brand‚Äôs core value: excitement/boredom. The next logical step was to tell online consumer-centric stories that couple powerful writing with original pulse-pounding film to dynamically dramatize the company‚Äôs core value from the consumer‚Äôs point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,651
This is why when you visit Red Bull‚Äôs website, you won‚Äôt find a picture of a Red Bull can or any bragging about its contents. Why? Because Red Bull recognizes that its typical fifteen-to twenty-five-year-old male customer doesn‚Äôt&lt;/p&gt;

Havas Media defines meaningful brands as those that inspire the thought, This brand improves my life. This sense of enhancement envelops both the consumer and the brand in an aura of well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

Put simply, we want more from life than money. People want genuine human connection, to be treated fairly, and to be treated honestly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,692
Given this context, to create a meaningful brand in the minds of consumers, it must be authentic. Consumers find a brand trustworthy and meaningful when two stories match: the story the brand tells about itself and the story the public tells about the brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,694
all brand stories must follow one simple principle: The core value of the story must match the core value of the brand. If these stories do not align, if promises made are not kept, the public feels betrayed and their sense of injustice indicts the brand as detrimental to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Location: 1,703
Havas reports that meaningfulness drives disproportionate financial results. Their global study of a thousand companies, employing three hundred thousand people, in thirty-four countries, across twelve industries, found that fully meaningful brands ‚Äú.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâsee their marketing KPIs perform 100 percent better overall compared with less Meaningful Brands.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, every 10 percent improvement in ‚Äúmeaningfulness‚Äù increases purchase intent by 6.6 percent, repurchase intent by 3.2 percent, customer advocacy by 4.8 percent, and premium pricing by 10.4 percent. Meaningful brands gain, on average, 46 percent more share of wallet than those ranked as not meaningful.

First, the Oral Care Center team finds the topics customers search most and then creates content to match. They ensure each article is optimized to rank well against search queries.7 By search optimizing content, Colgate.com creates an experience that ends the search. Customers find what they need. Every month Colgate.com broadens its audience and builds relationships that last. Second, Colgate does not use the Oral Care Center to promote the benefits of Colgate products. Brands lose credibility when they shift the focus of their content from helping the customer back to the bragging and promising of yesteryear.&lt;/p&gt;

Companies evolve into content marketing leaders when they move from sustained content creation to sustained storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

Caleb Barlow, VP IBM Security, explained their unique marketing challenge: ‚ÄúWhat we have is a very technical issue, a very complex issue, and in some cases a very scary issue that we need to be able to describe to people in order to get them to act. We‚Äôre not talking about products, like a collaboration system,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,886
that you log in to and use all day every day. We‚Äôre talking about products that, hopefully, you never see as an end user, and in some cases hopefully you never need to use. But boy, you‚Äôd better make sure they‚Äôre there when you need them. So storytelling becomes extraordinarily important.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,894
The resulting property, IBM‚Äôs award-winning SecurityIntelligence.com, breaks news on hacks, malware, data theft, and software vulnerabilities that can put enterprises at risk, and analyzes how others can avoid the same attacks.9 Hundreds of thousands of CISOs, CIOs, and CTOs visit and return to that property each month and are grateful to IBM for the help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,897
Caleb Barlow knows that a company loses credibility when it brags about itself or makes promises about its products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,898
So the vast majority of the content on SecurityIntelligence.com does not mention IBM, its products, or its solutions. Instead IBM simply provides the information that IT professionals need to do their job. As a result, some believe IBM‚Äôs credibility on IT security ranks higher than any traditional news source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,905
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre buying a security product,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,905
it‚Äôs kind of like buying a child seat for your kid: You‚Äôre not interested in second best,‚Äù Barlow explained. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs practical, but it‚Äôs also emotional.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,907
When C-suite executives decide it‚Äôs time to make new investments to keep their company safe, their first call goes to IBM Security because the brand became their trusted adviser through the stories shared on SecurityIntelligence.com.10 This is the secret all content marketing leaders know very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,911
The core value of the story must align with the core value of the brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,914
When we apply story form to demand/lead generation marketing, however, we apply the same form differently. In demand/lead generation stories, the protagonist will typically be a customer or prospective customer. The inciting incident will occur, at least in part, because the protagonist is not using the product/service your company offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,928
To use a story that ends on the negative effectively, marketers turn to comedy, as does Adobe. In comedy, the cardinal rule is that nobody actually gets hurt. If you do not employ comedy, you risk creating negative feelings about your brand‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,936
Original, sustainable story-driven content creation is not easy. Marketers with this ambition must develop a strategy, license a content marketing platform (CMP), recruit creatives, and implement a process for managing, reviewing, and improving that content every day. A regular publishing cadence of well-told stories requires time, money, and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,940
For that reason, some marketers cut corners and try to license or curate instead. Licensing content means that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,941
they pay a fee to media companies for the rights to pre-written stories or pre-produced videos. Curation eliminates fees by simply citing media stories and sending audiences to the original source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,943
Although content licensing and curating are cheap and fast, both are inherently flawed. If you use either means, how can you differentiate yourself from your competitors? What‚Äôs to stop your competition from emulating you, using the same content from the same sources? And most important, if you curate or license, how do you demonstrate thought leadership and expertise the way IBM Security does?&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúTechnology is radically reshaping how we work and how we interact with our colleagues. With over 21,000 employees in offices in 140 countries, we‚Äôre on the front lines with our clients, studying that change and defining how companies adapt to and capitalize on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,961
When a brand licenses or curates from various sources, it loses its voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,962
Every media company you might license content from writes in its own voice, from its own perspective, speaking with its own tone. ‚ÄúWhat we write has to be quintessentially Mercer,‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 1,963
‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs not, we aren‚Äôt building a relationship with our customer.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

To succeed, tell original stories regularly and consistently in your own voice. Do this and do it well and you, too, will become a leader in content marketing. Shortcuts won‚Äôt work.&lt;/p&gt;

Humanity‚Äôs first stories were danced and chanted around the fire in caves, as tribal leaders passed their knowledge from generation to generation. Ancient civilizations inscribed their myths and legends on the walls of temples and pyramids, carving them in stone to be read for eons.

Twenty-five years of research in seventeen different organizations has taught us that individuals who are the most influential‚Äîwho can get things done and at the same time build on relationships‚Äîare those who master their crucial conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

high performers know how to stand up to the boss without committing career suicide. We‚Äôve all seen people hurt their careers by ineffectively discussing tough issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Page: 10
You may have done it yourself. Fed up with a lengthy and unhealthy pattern of behavior, you finally speak out‚Äîbut a bit too abruptly. Oops. Or maybe an issue becomes so hot that as your peers twitch and fidget themselves into a quivering mass of potential stroke victims, you decide to say something. It‚Äôs not a pretty discussion‚Äîbut somebody has to have the guts to keep the boss from doing something stupid. (Gulp.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Page: 10
You don‚Äôt have to choose between candor and your career.&lt;/p&gt;

People who routinely hold crucial conversations and hold them well are able to express controversial and even risky opinions in a way that gets heard. Their bosses, peers, and direct reports listen without becoming defensive or angry.&lt;/p&gt;

Are there crucial conversations that you‚Äôre not holding or not holding well? Is&lt;/p&gt;

In a study of over 7,000 doctors and nurses, we‚Äôve found caregivers face this crucial moment all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Page: 11
And that‚Äôs not the problem! The real problem is that those who observe deviations or infractions say nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Page: 11
Across the world we‚Äôve found that the odds of a nurse speaking up in this crucial moment are less than one in twelve. The odds of doctors stepping up to similar crucial conversations aren‚Äôt much better.&lt;/p&gt;

that their people work in silos. They do great at tasks that are handled entirely within their team. Unfortunately, close to 80 percent of the projects that require cross-functional cooperation cost far more than expected, produce less than hoped for, and run significantly over budget. We wondered why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Page: 12
For example, could they speak up if they thought the scope and schedule were&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Page: 12
unrealistic? Or did they go silent when a cross-functional team member began sloughing off? Or even more tricky‚Äîwhat should they do when an executive failed to provide leadership for the effort?&lt;/p&gt;

The key to real change lies not in implementing a new process, but in getting people to hold one another accountable to the process.&lt;/p&gt;

And that requires Crucial Conversations skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Page: 13
In the worst companies, poor performers are first ignored and then transferred. In good companies, bosses eventually deal with problems. In the best companies, everyone holds everyone else accountable‚Äîregardless of level or position. The path to high productivity passes not through a static system, but through face-to-face conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 14
issues. But not everyone splits up. It‚Äôs how you argue that matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 14
For example, when our colleague, Howard Markman, examined couples in the throes of heated discussions, he learned that people fall into three categories‚Äîthose who digress into threats and name-calling, those who revert to silent fuming, and those who speak openly, honestly, and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

Those who routinely failed their crucial conversations had far weaker immune systems than those who found a way to resolve them well.&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying that the way you talk or don‚Äôt talk affects your body? It could kill you?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

So how about you? What are the specific conversations that gnaw at you the most? Which conversations (if you held them or improved them) would strengthen your immune system, help ward off disease, and increase your quality of life and well-being?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 18
When stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions start to run strong, casual conversations transform into crucial ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 18
Ironically, the more crucial the conversation, the less likely we are to handle it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 18
And now for the good news. As we learn how to step up to crucial conversations‚Äîand handle them well‚Äîwith one set of high-leverage skills we can influence virtually every domain of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 20
One of the opinion leaders we became particularly interested in meeting was named Kevin. He was the only one of eight vice presidents in his company to be identified as exceedingly influential. We wanted to know why. So we watched him at work. At first, Kevin didn‚Äôt do anything remarkable. In truth, he looked like every other VP. He answered his phone, talked to his direct reports, and continued about his pleasant, but routine, routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 20
team. No vague claim went unclarified, no unsupported reasoning unquestioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 21
Kevin continued to explain what he saw happening, and when he finished the first minutes of this delicate exchange, Chris was quiet for a moment. Then he nodded his head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre absolutely right,‚Äù he finally concluded. ‚ÄúI have been trying to force my opinion on you. Let‚Äôs back up and try again.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 21
‚ÄúDid you see how he did that? If you want to know how he gets things done, figure out what he just did.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 21
So we did. In fact, we spent the next twenty-five years discovering what Kevin and people like him do. What typically set them apart from the rest of the pack was their ability to avoid what we came to call the Fool‚Äôs Choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 22
The mistake most of us make in our crucial conversations is we believe that we have to choose between telling the truth and keeping a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 22
Consider Kevin, the all-star. When he took a breath and opened his mouth, his overriding question was, ‚ÄúHow can I be 100 percent honest with Chris, and at the same time be 100 percent respectful?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 22
They not only refused to make the Fool‚Äôs Choice, but they then acted in ways that were far more skilled than their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 23
When it comes to risky, controversial, and emotional conversations, skilled people find a way to get all relevant information (from themselves and others) out into the open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 23
At the core of every successful conversation lies the free flow of relevant information. People openly and honestly express their opinions, share their feelings, and articulate their theories. They willingly and capably share their views, even when their ideas are controversial or unpopular. It‚Äôs the one thing that, and precisely what, Kevin and the other extremely effective communicators we studied were routinely able to achieve. Now, to put a label on this spectacular talent‚Äîit‚Äôs called dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 23
di¬∑a¬∑logue or di¬∑a¬∑log (d√¨¬¥ ‚àÇ-l√¥g¬¥¬¥, -l√≤g) n The free flow of meaning between two or more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 24
Each of us enters conversations with our own opinions, feelings, theories, and experiences about the topic at hand. This unique combination of thoughts and feelings makes up our personal pool of meaning. This pool not only informs us, but also propels our every action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 24
People who are skilled at dialogue do their best to make it safe for everyone to add their meaning to the shared pool‚Äîeven ideas that at first glance appear controversial, wrong, or at odds with their own beliefs. Now, obviously, they don‚Äôt agree with every idea; they simply do their best to ensure that all ideas find their way into the open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 24
As the Pool of Shared Meaning grows, it helps people in two ways. First, as individuals are exposed to more accurate and relevant information, they make better choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 24
In a very real sense, the Pool of Shared Meaning is a measure of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 24
a group‚Äôs IQ. The larger the shared pool, the smarter the decisions. And even though many people may be involved in a choice, when people openly and freely share ideas, the increased time investment is more than offset by the quality of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 24
On the other hand, we‚Äôve all seen what happens when the shared pool is dangerously shallow. When people purposefully withhold meaning from one another, individually smart people can do collectively stupid things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 25
Of course, hospitals don‚Äôt have a monopoly on fear. In every instance where bosses are smart, highly paid, confident, and outspoken (i.e., most of the world), people tend to hold back their opinions rather than risk angering someone in a position of power. On the other hand, when people feel comfortable speaking up and meaning does flow freely, the shared pool can dramatically increase a group‚Äôs ability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 25
to make better decisions. Consider what happened to Kevin‚Äôs group. As everyone on the team began to explain his or her opinion, people formed a clearer and more complete picture of the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

We act like we know everything, hoping people will believe our arguments. We discredit others, hoping people won‚Äôt believe their arguments. And then we use every manner of force to get our way or possibly even harm others. We borrow power from the boss; we hit people with biased monologues; we make hurtful comments‚Ä¶

In order to move to our best, we have to find a way to explain what is in each of our personal pools of meaning‚Äîespecially our high-stakes, sensitive, and controversial opinions, feelings, and ideas‚Äîand to get others to share their pools.

What starts as a doomed discussion ends up with a healthy resolution. It can take your breath away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 28
Finally, we combined our philosophies, theories, models, and skills into a package of learnable tools‚Äîtools for talking when stakes are high. We then taught these skills and watched as key performance indicators and relationships improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 29
On a beautiful sunset balcony in Houston, my dad and I spent three tense hours dealing with a lot of pain and built-up resentment. I kept in mind what I had been taught and, rather than compromising candor, tried my best to create the conditions where we could be both honest and respectful. It was incredibly difficult. Sometimes the honesty threatened to put us right back in the angry state that got us there. But I kept focusing on what I really wanted‚Äîa relationship with my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 30
This is what most people have in mind when they think of crucial conversations. How do I express delicate feedback? How do I speak persuasively, not abrasively? And how about listening? Or better still, what can we do to get people to talk when they seem nervous? And how do we move from thought to action? As you read on, you will learn the key skills of talking, listening, and acting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 35
Our problem is not that our behavior degenerates. It‚Äôs that our motives do‚Äîa fact that we usually miss.&lt;/p&gt;

Skilled people Start with Heart. That is, they begin high-risk discussions with the right motives, and they stay focused no matter what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

Winning. This particular dialogue killer sits at the top of many of our lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 39
Punishing. Sometimes, as our anger increases, we move from wanting to win the point to wanting to harm the other person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 39
We move so far away from adding meaning to the pool that now all we want is to see others suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 39
Keeping the peace. Of course, we don‚Äôt always fix mistakes, aggressively discredit others, or heartlessly try to make them suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

We were wondering what had happened to Greta? How, we puzzled, did she remain so composed while under fire? Specifically, how did she move so quickly from wanting to get even with or possibly even humiliate the questioner to sincerely soliciting feedback?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Page: 41
What had helped her move from embarrassment and anger to gratitude?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Page: 41
‚ÄúAt first I did feel attacked, and I wanted to strike back. To be honest, I wanted to put that guy in his place. He was accusing me in public, and he was wrong.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Page: 41
‚ÄúAnd then it struck me,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúDespite the fact that I had 400 eyeballs pinned to me, a rather important question hit me like a ton of bricks: ‚ÄòWhat do I really want here?‚Äô‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Page: 41
Asking this question had a powerful effect on Greta‚Äôs thinking. As she focused on this far more important question, she quickly realized that her goal was to encourage these 200 managers to embrace the cost-reduction efforts‚Äîand to thereby influence thousands of others to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Page: 41
As Greta contemplated this goal, she realized that the biggest barrier she faced was the widespread belief that she was a hypocrite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Page: 42
Interestingly, by transforming her motives Greta simultaneously transformed the way she saw the man who asked the question. Whereas seconds earlier he looked like an enemy, when her motives changed, the fellow now looked like an ally. In fact, this man had just handed her the best chance she could get to influence the audience by letting her publicly address a primary source of resistance to the cost-cutting effort. And so Greta moved to dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Page: 42
intervention‚Äîthe simple act of asking a potent question‚Äîcan have a powerful effect on redirecting our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

Refocus your brain. Now, let‚Äôs move to a situation you might face. You‚Äôre speaking with someone who completely disagrees with you on a hot issue. How does all of this goal stuff apply? As you begin the discussion, start by examining your motives. Going in, ask yourself what you really want. Also, as the conversation unfolds and you find yourself starting to, say, defer to the boss or give your spouse the cold shoulder, pay attention to what‚Äôs happening to your objectives. Are you starting to change your goal to save face, avoid embarrassment, win, be right, or punish others? Here‚Äôs the‚Ä¶

&lt;p&gt;Orange highlight | Page: 42
In order to move back to motives that allow for dialogue, you must step away from the interaction and look at yourself‚Äîmuch like an outsider. Ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat am I doing, and if I had to guess, what does it tell me about my underlying motive?‚Äù As you make an honest effort to discover your motive, you might conclude: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see. I‚Äôm pushing hard, making the argument stronger than I actually believe, and‚Ä¶

Once you call into question the shifting desires of your heart, you can make conscious choices to change them. ‚ÄúWhat I really want is to genuinely try to select a vacation spot we can all enjoy‚Äîrather than try to win people over to my ideas.‚Äù‚Ä¶

&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 43
But how? How do you recognize what has happened to you, stop playing games, and then influence your own motives? Do what Greta did. Stop and ask yourself some questions that return you to dialogue. You can ask these questions either when you find yourself slipping out of dialogue or as reminders when‚Ä¶

Find your bearings. There are two good reasons for asking these questions. First, the answer to what we really want helps us to locate our own North Star.

&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 44
Take charge of your body. The second reason for asking what we really want is no less important. When we ask ourselves what we really want, we affect our entire physiology. As we introduce complex and abstract questions to our mind, the problem-solving part of our brain recognizes that‚Ä¶

‚ÄúAm I the only one who wonders why we even allow this fossil to talk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 45
colleagues‚Äîunder the influence of adrenaline we start to see our options as unnecessarily limited. We assume we have to choose between getting results and keeping a relationship. In our dumbed-down condition, we don‚Äôt even consider the option of achieving both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 45
That‚Äôs why those who are skilled at crucial conversations present their brain with a more complex question. They routinely ask: ‚ÄúWhat do I want for myself, the other person, and the relationship?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 45
When our brain isn‚Äôt functioning well, we resist complexity. We adore the ease of simply choosing between attacking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 45
or hiding‚Äîand the fact that we think it makes us look good. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I just had to destroy the guy‚Äôs self-image if I was going to keep my integrity. It wasn‚Äôt pretty, but it was the right thing to do.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 45
that. You‚Äôll find there is a way to share your concerns, listen sincerely to those of others, and build the relationship‚Äîall at the same time. And the results can be life changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 46
First, clarify what you really want. You‚Äôve got a head start if you‚Äôve already Started with Heart. If you know what you want for yourself, for others, and for the relationship, then you‚Äôre in position to break out of the Fool‚Äôs Choice. ‚ÄúWhat I want is for my husband to be more reliable. I‚Äôm tired of being let down by him when he makes commitments that I depend on.‚Äù Second, clarify what you really don‚Äôt want. This is the key to framing the and question. Think of what you are afraid will happen to you if you back away from your current strategy of trying to win or stay safe. What bad thing will happen if you stop pushing so hard? Or if you don‚Äôt try to escape? What horrible outcome makes game playing an attractive and sensible option? ‚ÄúWhat I don‚Äôt want is to have a useless and heated conversation that creates bad feelings and doesn‚Äôt lead to change.‚Äù Third, present your brain with a more complex problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 47
There is a third set of options out there that allows you to add meaning to the pool and build on the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 48
At first, we thought that maybe there were places where dialogue couldn‚Äôt survive. But then we learned to ask: ‚ÄúAre you saying there isn‚Äôt anyone you know who is able to hold a high-risk conversation in a way that solves problems and builds relationships?‚Äù There usually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 48
Work on Me First, Us Second ‚Ä¢ Remember that the only person you can directly control is yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 48
Focus on What You Really Want&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 48
When you find yourself moving toward silence or violence, stop and pay attention to your motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 48
Ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat does my behavior tell me about what my motives are?‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Then, clarify what you really want. Ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat do I want for myself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 48
For others? For the relationship?‚Äù ‚Ä¢ And finally, ask: ‚ÄúHow would I behave if this were what I really wanted?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 48
As you consider what you want, notice when you start talking yourself into a Fool‚Äôs Choice. ‚Ä¢ Watch to see if you‚Äôre telling yourself that you must choose between peace and honesty, between winning and losing, and so on. ‚Ä¢ Break free of these Fool‚Äôs Choices by searching for the and. ‚Ä¢ Clarify what you don‚Äôt want, add it to what you do want, and ask your brain to start searching for healthy options to bring you to dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 52
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù your coworker explains, ‚ÄúI always watch two elements. When things start turning ugly, I watch the content of the conversation (the topic under discussion) along with the conditions (what people are doing in response). I look for and examine both what and why. If you can see why people are becoming upset or holding back their views or even going silent, you can do something to get back on track.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 53
In truth, most of us do have trouble dual-processing (simultaneously watching for content and conditions)‚Äîespecially when both stakes and emotions are high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 54
Actually, it helps to watch for three different conditions: the moment a conversation turns crucial, signs that people don‚Äôt feel safe (silence or violence), and your own Style Under Stress. Let‚Äôs consider each of these conversation killers in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 54
To help catch problems early, reprogram your mind to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 54
pay attention to the signs that suggest you‚Äôre in a crucial conversation. Some people first notice physical signals‚Äîtheir stomach gets tight or their eyes get dry. Think about what happens to your body when conversations get tough. Everyone is a little bit different. What are your cues? Whatever they are, learn to look at them as signs to step back, slow down, and Start with Heart before things get out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 55
People who are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 55
gifted at dialogue keep a constant vigil on safety. They pay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 55
When it‚Äôs safe, you can say anything. Here‚Äôs why gifted communicators keep a close eye on safety. Dialogue calls for the free flow of meaning‚Äîperiod. And nothing kills the flow of meaning like fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 55
This is a pretty remarkable claim. Think about it. We‚Äôre suggesting that people rarely become defensive simply because of what you‚Äôre saying. They only become defensive when they no longer feel safe. The problem is not the content of your message, but the condition of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 56
On the other hand, if you don‚Äôt feel safe, you can‚Äôt take any feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 56
It‚Äôs as if the pool of meaning has a lid on it. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean I look good? Is that some kind of joke? Are you insulting me?‚Äù When you don‚Äôt feel safe, even well-intended comments are suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 56
When it‚Äôs unsafe, you start to go blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 57
As we‚Äôve said before, when your emotions start cranking up, key brain functions start shutting down. Not only do you prepare to take flight, but your peripheral vision actually narrows. In fact, when you feel genuinely threatened, you can scarcely see beyond what‚Äôs right in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 57
By pulling yourself out of the content of an argument and looking for signs that safety is a risk, you reengage your brain and your full vision returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 57
As we suggested earlier, when you give your brain a new problem to consider (keep alert for signs that safety is at risk!), it affects your brain functioning. Your higher reasoning centers stay more active, and you‚Äôre far less likely to be dumbed down and far more likely to succeed in your crucial conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 57
Don‚Äôt let safety problems lead you astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 57
Imagine the magnitude of what we‚Äôre suggesting here. We‚Äôre asking you to recode silence and violence as signs that people are feeling unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 57
We‚Äôre asking you to fight your natural tendency to respond in kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 57
We‚Äôre asking you to undo years of practice, maybe even eons of genetic shaping that prod you to take flight or pick a fight (when under attack), and recode the stimulus. ‚ÄúAh, that‚Äôs a sign that the other person feels unsafe.‚Äù And then what? Do something to make it safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 58
Imagine increased influence, enhanced relationships, stronger teams, and more effective leadership. Turn on your capacity to recognize and respond to safety problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 58
In the next chapter we‚Äôll explore how. For now, simply learn to look for safety, and then be curious, not angry or frightened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 58
As people begin to feel unsafe, they start down one of two unhealthy paths. They move either to silence (withholding meaning from the pool) or to violence (trying to force&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 58
The three most common forms of silence are masking, avoiding, and withdrawing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 60
The three most common forms are controlling, labeling, and attacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 62
Actually, no. Perhaps the most difficult element to watch closely as you‚Äôre madly dual-processing is your own behavior. Frankly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 62
Unfortunately, when you fail to monitor your own behavior, you can look pretty silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 75
The good realize that safety is at risk, but they fix it in exactly the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 75
They try to make the subject more palatable by sugarcoating their message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 75
The best don‚Äôt play games. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 76
So they do something completely different. They step out of the content of the conversation, make it safe, and then step back in. Once safety is restored, they can talk about nearly anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 76
For example, Yvonne gets back on the path of dialogue by saying: ‚ÄúCan we change gears for a minute? I‚Äôd like to talk about what happens when we‚Äôre not romantically in sync. It would be good if we could both share what‚Äôs working and what isn‚Äôt. My goal isn‚Äôt to make you feel guilty, and I certainly don‚Äôt want to become defensive. What I‚Äôd really love is for us to come up with a solution that makes us both satisfied in our relationship.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 76
but because they believe the content (even if it‚Äôs delivered in a gentle way) suggests that you have a malicious intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 77
How can others feel safe when they believe you‚Äôre out to harm them? Soon, every word out of your mouth is suspect. You can‚Äôt utter a harmless ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù without others interpreting it in a negative way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Mutual Purpose is the entry condition of dialogue. Find a shared goal, and you have both a good reason and a healthy climate for talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Watch for signs that Mutual Purpose is at risk. How do we&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Do others believe I care about their goals in this conversation? ‚Ä¢ Do they trust my motives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Remember the Mutual in Mutual Purpose. Just a word to the wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 78
What do I want for me? ‚Ä¢ What do I want for others? ‚Ä¢ What do I want for the relationship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 78
Look for the mutuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 78
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve got a boss who frequently fails to keep commitments. How could you tell the boss you don‚Äôt trust him? Surely there‚Äôs no way to say this without the boss becoming defensive or vengeful, because he knows that your goal is merely to make your life better. To avoid disaster, find a Mutual Purpose that would be so motivating to the boss that he‚Äôd want to hear your concerns. If your only reason for approaching the boss is to get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 78
what you want, the boss will hear you as critical and selfish‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 78
which is what you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 78
Imagine raising the topic this way: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got some ideas for how I can be much more reliable and even reduce costs by a few thousand dollars in preparing the report each month. It‚Äôs going to be a bit of a sensitive conversation‚Äîbut I think it will help a great deal if we can talk about it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 79
While it‚Äôs true that there‚Äôs no reason to enter a crucial conversation if you don‚Äôt have Mutual Purpose, it‚Äôs equally true that you can‚Äôt stay in the conversation if you don‚Äôt maintain Mutual Respect. Mutual Respect is the continuance condition of dialogue. As people perceive that others don‚Äôt respect them, the conversation immediately becomes unsafe and dialogue comes to a screeching halt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 79
Why? Because respect is like air. As long as it‚Äôs present, nobody thinks about it. But if you take it away, it‚Äôs all that people can think about. The instant people perceive disrespect in a conversation, the interaction is no longer about the original purpose‚Äîit is now about defending dignity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 79
Telltale signs. To spot when respect is violated and safety takes a turn south, watch for signs that people are defending their dignity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 79
Emotions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 79
When people feel disrespected, they become highly charged. Their emotions turn from fear to anger. Then they resort to pouting, name-calling, yelling, and making threats. Ask the following question to determine when Mutual Respect is at risk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 80
Do others believe I respect them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 80
How, they wonder, can they share the same purpose with people who come from completely different backgrounds or whose morals or values differ from theirs? What do you do, for example, if you‚Äôre upset because another person has let you down? And if this has repeatedly happened, how can you respect a person who is so poorly motivated and selfish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 80
Dialogue truly would be doomed if we had to share every objective or respect every element of another person‚Äôs character before we could talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 80
However, we can stay in dialogue by finding a way to honor and regard another person‚Äôs basic humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 80
In essence, feelings of disrespect often come when we dwell on how others are different from ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:Difference - disrespect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 80
We can counteract these feelings by looking for ways we are similar. Without excusing others‚Äô behavior, we try to sympathize, even empathize, with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 80
prayer‚Äî‚ÄúLord, help me forgive those who sin differently than I.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 80
When we do this, we feel a kinship or mutuality between ourselves and even the thorniest of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 80
This sense of kinship and connection to others helps create Mutual Respect and eventually enables us to stay in dialogue with virtually anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 81
Each group was to go into a separate room and write out its goals for the company on flip-chart-sized paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 81
After a few minutes the two groups returned to the training room. They were positively stunned. It was as if they had written the exact same lists. They didn‚Äôt merely share the shadow of an idea or two. Their aspirations were nearly identical. All wanted a profitable company, stable and rewarding jobs, high-quality products, and a positive impact on the community. Given a chance to speak freely and without fear of attack, each group laid out not simply what it wanted, but what virtually every person wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 82
Apologize ‚Ä¢ Contrast ‚Ä¢ Create a Mutual Purpose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 83
But you fail to restore safety. Why? Because now you feel disrespected. They‚Äôve attacked you. So you stay stuck in the content of the conversation‚Äîthinking this has something to do with the factory tour.&lt;/p&gt;

When you‚Äôve made a mistake that has hurt others (e.g., you didn‚Äôt call the team), start with an apology. An apology is a statement that sincerely expresses your sorrow for your role in causing‚Äîor at least not preventing‚Äîpain or difficulty to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 84
Now, an apology isn‚Äôt really an apology unless you experience a change in heart. To offer a sincere apology, your motives have to change. You have to give up saving face, being right, or winning in order to focus on what you really want. You have to sacrifice a bit of your ego by admitting your error. But like many sacrifices, when you give up something you value, you‚Äôre rewarded with something even more valuable‚Äîhealthy dialogue and better results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 84
Sometimes others feel disrespected during crucial conversations even though you haven‚Äôt done anything disrespectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 84
But just as often, the insult is entirely unintended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 85
When others misinterpret either your purpose or your intent, step out of the argument and rebuild safety by using a skill called Contrasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 85
Contrasting is a don‚Äôt/do statement that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 85
Addresses others‚Äô concerns that you don‚Äôt respect them or that you have a malicious purpose (the don‚Äôt part). ‚Ä¢ Confirms your respect or clarifies your real purpose (the do part).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 85
[The don‚Äôt part] ‚ÄúThe last thing I wanted to do was communicate that I don‚Äôt value the work you put in or that I didn‚Äôt want to share it with the VP. [The do part] I think your work has been nothing short of spectacular.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 86
Of the two parts of Contrasting, the don‚Äôt is the more important because it deals with the misunderstanding that has put safety at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 87
Contrasting provides context and proportion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 87
you talk with your assistant about his lack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 88
At this point, you could be tempted to water down your content‚Äî‚ÄúYou know it‚Äôs really not that big a deal.‚Äù Don‚Äôt give into the temptation. Don‚Äôt take back what you‚Äôve said. Instead, put your remarks in context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 88
‚ÄúLet me put this in perspective. I don‚Äôt want you to think I‚Äôm not satisfied with the quality of your work. I want us to continue working together. I really do think you‚Äôre doing a good job. This punctuality issue is important to me, and I‚Äôd just like you to work on that. If you will be more attentive to that, there are no other issues.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 88
Use Contrasting for prevention or first aid. Contrasting can be useful both as prevention and as first aid for safety problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 88
So far our examples have helped us apply first&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 88
aid to a wounded conversation. Someone has taken something wrong, and we‚Äôve intervened to clarify our true purpose or meaning. When we‚Äôre aware that something we‚Äôre about to drop into the pool of meaning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 88
When people misunderstand and you start arguing over the misunderstanding, stop. Use Contrasting. Explain what you don‚Äôt mean until you‚Äôve restored safety. Then return to the conversation. Safety first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 91
The worst at dialogue either ignore the problem and push ahead or roll over and let others have their way. They opt for either competition or submission. Both strategies end up making winners and losers, and the problem continues long beyond the initial conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 91
The good at dialogue move immediately toward compromise. For example, the couple facing the transfer sets up two house-holds‚Äîone where the transferred spouse will be working and one where the family currently lives. Nobody really wants this arrangement, and frankly, it‚Äôs a pretty ugly solution that‚Äôs bound to lead to more serious problems, even divorce. While compromise is sometimes necessary,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 91
The best at dialogue use four skills to create a Mutual Purpose. If it helps you remember what to do, note that the four skills used in creating Mutual Purpose form the acronym CRIB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 104
You make you mad. You make you scared, annoyed, or insulted. You and only you create your emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 104
Claim two. Once you‚Äôve created your upset emotions, you have only two options: You can act on them or be acted on by them. That is, when it comes to strong emotions, you either find a way to master them or fall hostage to them. Here‚Äôs how this all unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 106
The best at dialogue do something completely different. They aren‚Äôt held hostage by their emotions, nor do they try to hide or suppress them. Instead, they act on their emotions. That is, when they have strong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 107
feelings, they influence (and often change) their emotions by thinking them out. As a result, they choose their emotions, and by so doing, make it possible to choose behaviors that create better results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 107
holding her feelings inside (avoiding) and taking cheap shots (masking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 108
As it turns out, there is an intermediate step between what others do and how we feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 108
There‚Äôs always an intermediate step because actions themselves can‚Äôt and don‚Äôt cause emotional reactions. That‚Äôs why, when faced with the exact same circumstances, ten people may have ten different emotional responses. For instance, with a coworker like Louis, some might feel insulted whereas others merely feel curious. Some become angry and others feel concern or even sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 108
What is this intermediate step? Just after we observe what others do and just before we feel some emotion about it, we tell ourselves a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 108
We add meaning to the action we observed. We make a guess at the motive driving the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 108
Why were they doing that? We also add judgment‚Äîis that good or bad? And then, based on these thoughts or stories, our body responds with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 108
an emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 109
Stories provide our rationale for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 109
what‚Äôs going on. They‚Äôre our interpretations of the facts. They help explain what we see and hear. They‚Äôre theories we use to explain why, how, and what. For instance, Maria asks: ‚ÄúWhy does Louis take over? He doesn‚Äôt trust my ability to communicate. He thinks that because I‚Äôm a woman, people won‚Äôt listen to me.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 111
If we take control of our stories, they won‚Äôt control us. People who excel at dialogue are able to influence their emotions during crucial conversations. They recognize that while it‚Äôs true that at first we are in control of the stories we tell‚Äîafter all, we do make them up of our own accord‚Äîonce they‚Äôre told, the stories control us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 111
But it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. We can tell different stories and break the loop. In fact, until we tell different stories, we cannot break the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 113
Not only do those who are best at crucial conversations notice when they‚Äôre slipping into silence or violence, but they‚Äôre also able to admit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 113
The moment they realize that they‚Äôre killing dialogue, they review their own Path to Action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 113
Actually, identifying your emotions is more difficult than you might imagine. In fact, many people are emotionally illiterate. When asked to describe how they‚Äôre feeling, they use words such as ‚Äúbad‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 113
or ‚Äúangry‚Äù or ‚Äúfrightened‚Äù‚Äîwhich would be okay if these were accurate descriptors, but often they‚Äôre not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 113
Individuals say they‚Äôre angry when, in fact, they‚Äôre feeling a mix of embarrassment and surprise. Or they suggest they‚Äôre unhappy when they‚Äôre feeling violated. Perhaps they suggest they‚Äôre upset when&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 114
they‚Äôre really feeling humiliated and cheated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 114
Since life doesn‚Äôt consist of a series of vocabulary tests, you might wonder what difference words can make. But words do matter. Knowing what you‚Äôre really feeling helps you take a more accurate look at what is going on and why. For instance, you‚Äôre far&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 114
more likely to take an honest look at the story you‚Äôre telling yourself if you admit you‚Äôre feeling both embarrassed and surprised rather than simply angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 114
Meaning, of course, are you telling the right story? After all, feelings come from stories, and stories are our own invention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 114
The first step to regaining emotional control is to challenge the illusion that what you‚Äôre feeling is the only right emotion under the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 114
This may be the hardest step, but it‚Äôs also the most important one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 114
By questioning our feelings, we open ourselves up to question our stories. We challenge the comfortable conclusion that our story is right and true. We willingly question whether our emotions (very real), and the story behind them (only one of many possible explanations), are accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 115
As we said earlier, others could watch Maria‚Äôs interactions with Louis and walk away with different stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 115
Test your ideas against a simple criterion: Can you see or hear this thing you‚Äôre calling a fact? Was it an actual behavior?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 115
However, the statement ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt trust me‚Äù is a conclusion. It explains what you think, not what the other person did. Conclusions are subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 116
Either our stories are completely accurate and propel us in healthy directions, or they‚Äôre quite inaccurate but justify our current behavior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 116
us feel good about ourselves and calling for no need to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 116
We call these imaginative and self-serving concoctions ‚Äúclever stories.‚Äù They‚Äôre clever because they allow us to feel good about behaving badly. Better yet, they allow us to feel good about behaving badly even while achieving abysmal results. When we feel a need to justify&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 116
we tend to tell our stories in three very predictable ways. Learn what the three are and how to counteract them, and you can take control of your emotional&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118
In Victim Stories we exaggerate our own innocence. In Villain Stories we overemphasize the other person‚Äôs guilt or stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118
We automatically assume the worst possible motives or grossest incompetence while ignoring any possible good or neutral&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118
intentions or skills a person may have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118
Labeling is a common device in Villain Stories. For example, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe that bonehead gave me bad materials again.‚Äù By employing the handy label, we are now dealing not with a complex human being, but with a bonehead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118
After all, we can feel okay insulting or abusing a bonehead‚Äîwhereas we might have to be more careful with a living, breathing person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118
Then when we fail to get the results we really want, we stay stuck in our ineffective behavior because, after all, look who we‚Äôre dealing with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 119
Finally come Helpless Stories. In&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 119
these fabrications we make ourselves out to be powerless to do anything healthy or helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 119
We convince ourselves that there are no healthy alternatives for dealing with our predicament, which justifies the action we‚Äôre about to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 119
Villain and Victim Stories look back to explain why we‚Äôre in the situation we‚Äôre in, Helpless Stories look forward to explain why we can‚Äôt do anything to change our situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 119
helpless when we turn others‚Äô behavior into fixed and unchangeable traits. For example, when we decide our colleague is a ‚Äúcontrol freak‚Äù (Villain Story), we are less inclined to give her feedback because, after all, control freaks like her don‚Äôt accept feedback (Helpless Story). Nothing we can do will change that fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 119
As you can see, Helpless Stories often stem from Villain Stories and typically offer us nothing more than Fool‚Äôs Choices‚Äî we can either be honest and ruin the relationship or stay silent and suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 119
Clever stories match reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 120
Clever stories get us off the hook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 121
Your spouse‚Äôs annoying habit didn‚Äôt become a source of resentment until you became part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
Once we‚Äôve learned to recognize the clever stories we tell ourselves, we can move to the final Master My Stories skill. The dialogue-smart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
recognize that they‚Äôre telling clever stories, stop, and then do what it takes to tell a useful story. A useful story, by definition, creates emotions that lead to healthy action‚Äîsuch as dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 123
‚Ä¢ Am I pretending not to notice my role in the problem? This question jars you into facing up to the fact that maybe, just maybe, you did something to help cause the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 123
Perhaps your contribution was merely a thoughtless omission. Nonetheless, you contributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 124
Turn villains into humans. When you find yourself labeling or otherwise vilifying others, stop and ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 124
‚Ä¢ Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do what this person is doing? This particular question humanizes others. As we search for plausible answers to it, our emotions soften. Empathy often replaces judgment, and depending upon how we‚Äôve treated others, personal accountability replaces self-justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 124
Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do what this person is doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 124

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 124
But what if she really were a reasonable, rational, and decent person? What if she had no motive other than to give you a hand? Isn‚Äôt it a bit early to be vilifying her? And if you do, don‚Äôt you run the risk of ruining a relationship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 124
The purpose of the humanizing question is to deal with our own stories and emotions. It provides us with still another tool for working on ourselves first by providing a variety of possible reasons for the other person‚Äôs behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 124
In fact, with experience and maturity we learn to worry less about others‚Äô intent and more about the effect others‚Äô actions are having on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 124
And here‚Äôs the good news. When we reflect on alternative motives, not only do we soften our emotions, but equally important, we relax our absolute certainty long enough to allow for dialogue‚Äî the only reliable way of discovering others‚Äô genuine motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 125
Turn the helpless into the able. Finally, when you catch yourself bemoaning your own helplessness, you can tell the complete story by returning to your original motive. To do so, stop and ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 125
What do I really want? For me? For others? For the relationship? Then, kill the Fool‚Äôs Choice that‚Äôs made you feel helpless to choose anything other than silence or violence. Do this by asking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 125
‚Ä¢ What would I do right now if I really wanted these results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 125
What would I do right now if I really wanted these results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 125
When you refuse to make yourself helpless, you‚Äôre forced to hold yourself accountable for using your dialogue skills rather than bemoaning your weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 126
As we tell the rest of the story, we free ourselves from the poisoning effects of unhealthy emotions. Best of all, as we regain control and move back to dialogue, we become masters of our own emotions rather than hostages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 128
As soon as she shows signs of frustration, I stop and remind her that I am on her side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 131
So far we‚Äôve gone to great pains to prepare ourselves to step up to and master crucial conversations. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve learned. Our hearts need to be in the right place. We need to pay close attention to crucial conversations‚Äîparticularly when people start feeling unsafe‚Äîand restore safety when necessary. And heaven forbid that we should tell ourselves clever and unhelpful stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 131
Most of the time, we walk into a discussion and slide into autopilot. ‚ÄúHi, how are the kids? What‚Äôs going on at work?‚Äù What could be easier than talking? We know thousands of words and generally weave them into sentences that suit our needs. Most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 132
However, when stakes rise and our emotions kick in, well, that‚Äôs when we open our mouths and don‚Äôt do so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 132
In fact, as we suggested earlier, the more important the discussion, the less likely we are to be on our best behavior. More specifically, we advocate or express our views quite poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 132
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Marta, but people simply don‚Äôt like working with you. You‚Äôve been asked to leave the special-projects team.‚Äù It‚Äôs one thing to argue that your company needs to shift from green to red packaging; it‚Äôs quite another to tell a person that he or she is offensive or unlikable. When the topic turns from things to people, it‚Äôs always more difficult, and to nobody‚Äôs surprise, some people are better at it than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 133
The best at dialogue speak their minds completely and do it in a way that makes it safe for others to hear what they have to say and respond to it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 133
They are both totally frank and completely respectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 133
if you know how to carefully blend three ingredients‚Äîconfidence, humility, and skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 133
People who are skilled at dialogue have the confidence to say what needs to be said to the person who needs to hear it. They are confident that their opinions deserve to be placed in the pool of meaning. They are also confident that they can speak openly without brutalizing others or causing undue offense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 133
Skilled people are confident that they have something to say, but also realize that others have valuable input. They are humble enough to realize that they don‚Äôt have a monopoly on the truth nor do they always have to win their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 134
This means they‚Äôre willing to both express their opinions and encourage others to do the same. Skill. Finally, people who willingly share delicate information are good at doing it. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre confident in the first place. They don‚Äôt make a Fool‚Äôs Choice, because they‚Äôve found a path that allows for both candor and safety. They speak the unspeakable, and people are grateful for their honesty.&lt;/p&gt;

moving back to Australia)? What‚Äôs the worst way of talking about the problem? Most people agree that jumping in with an ugly accusation followed by a threat is a good candidate for that distinction. It‚Äôs also what most people do, and Carole is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 136
Share your facts ‚Ä¢ Tell your story ‚Ä¢ Ask for others‚Äô paths ‚Ä¢ Talk tentatively ‚Ä¢ Encourage testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 137
Of course, starting with our ugly stories is the most controversial, least influential, and most insulting way we could begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 138
it. We hold it inside where the story builds up steam, and when we do eventually share our horrific story, we do so with a vengeance. The cycle starts all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 138
Facts are the least controversial. Facts provide a safe beginning. By their very nature, facts aren‚Äôt controversial. That‚Äôs why we call them facts. For example, consider the statement: ‚ÄúYesterday you arrived at work twenty minutes late.‚Äù No dispute there. Conclusions, on the other hand, are highly controversial. For example: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be trusted.‚Äù That‚Äôs hardly a fact. Actually, it‚Äôs more like an insult, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 138
Facts are the most persuasive. In addition to being less controversial, facts are also more persuasive than subjective conclusions. Facts form the foundation of belief. So if you want to persuade others, don‚Äôt start with your stories. Start with your observations. For example, which of the following do you find more persuasive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 138
‚ÄúI want you to stop sexually harassing me!‚Äù or ¬† ‚ÄúWhen you talk to me, your eyes move up and down rather than look at my face. And sometimes you put your hand on my shoulder.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 139
When we start with shocking or offensive conclusions (‚ÄúQuit groping me with your eyes!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI think we should declare bankruptcy‚Äù), we actually encourage others to tell Villain Stories about us. Since we‚Äôve given them no facts to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 139
support our conclusion, they make up reasons we‚Äôre saying these things. They‚Äôre likely to believe we‚Äôre either stupid or evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 139
And if you aren‚Äôt sure what your facts are (your story is absolutely filling your brain), take the time to think them through before you enter the crucial conversation. Take the time to sort out facts from conclusions. Gathering the facts is the homework required for crucial conversations. Facts are the least insulting. If you do want to share your story, don‚Äôt start with it. Your story (particularly if it has led to a rather ugly conclusion) could easily surprise and insult others. It could kill safety in one rash, ill-conceived sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 140
Begin your path with facts. In order to talk about your stories, you need to lead the others involved down your Path to Action. Let them experience your path from the beginning to the end, and not from the end to‚Äîwell, to wherever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 140
Earn the right to share your story by starting with your facts. Facts lay the groundwork for all delicate conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 140
Sharing your story can be tricky. Even if you‚Äôve started with your facts, the other person can still become defensive when you move from facts to stories. After all, you‚Äôre sharing potentially unflattering conclusions and judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 141
(Sounds like it‚Äôs time for a conclusion.) ‚ÄúI was wondering what the software is doing in your briefcase. It looks like you‚Äôre taking it home. Is that what‚Äôs going on here?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 141
It takes confidence. To be honest, it can be difficult to share negative conclusions and unattractive judgments (e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wondering if you‚Äôre a thief‚Äù). It takes confidence to share such a potentially inflammatory story. However, if you‚Äôve done your homework by thinking through the facts behind your story, you‚Äôll realize that you are drawing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 141
By thinking through the facts and then leading with them, you‚Äôre much more likely to have the confidence you need to add controversial and vitally important meaning to the shared pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 142
Look for safety problems. As you share your story, watch for signs that safety is deteriorating. If people start becoming defensive or appear to be insulted, step out of the conversation and rebuild safety by Contrasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 143
Be careful not to apologize for your views. Remember, the goal of Contrasting is not to water down your message, but to be sure that people don‚Äôt hear more than you intend. Be confident enough to share what you really want to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 144
One of the ironies of dialogue is that, when talking with those holding opposing opinions, the more convinced and forceful you act, the more resistant others become. Speaking in absolute and overstated terms does not increase your influence, it decreases it. The converse is also true‚Äîthe more tentatively you speak, the more open people become to your opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 145

Just right: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre intending this, but I‚Äôm beginning to feel rejected.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 146
Safety becomes particularly important when you‚Äôre having a crucial conversation with people who might move to silence. Some people make Fool‚Äôs Choices in these circumstances. They worry that if they share their true opinions, others will clam up. So they choose between speaking their minds and hearing others out. But the best at dialogue don‚Äôt choose. They do both. They understand that the only limit to how strongly you can express your opinion is your willingness to be equally vigorous in encouraging others to challenge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 146
Invite opposing views. So if you think others may be hesitant, make it clear that you want to hear their views‚Äîno matter how different. If others disagree, so much the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 147
‚ÄúDoes anyone see it differently?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat am I missing here?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 147
Mean it. Sometimes people offer an invitation that sounds more like a threat than a legitimate call for opinions. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs how I see it. Nobody disagrees, do they?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 147
Play devil‚Äôs advocate. Occasionally you can tell that others are not buying into your facts or story, but they‚Äôre not speaking up either. You‚Äôve sincerely invited them, even encouraged differing views, but nobody says anything. To help grease the skids, play devil‚Äôs advocate. Model disagreeing by disagreeing with your own view. ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm wrong here. What if the opposite is true? What if the reason sales have dropped is because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 148
It‚Äôs just that it might help put my mind to rest if we were to check on this right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 150
It starts with a story. When we feel the need to push our ideas on others, it‚Äôs generally because we believe we‚Äôre right and everyone else is wrong. There‚Äôs no need to expand the pool of meaning, because we own the pool. We also firmly believe it‚Äôs our duty to fight for the truth that we‚Äôre holding. It‚Äôs the honorable thing to do. It‚Äôs what people of character do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 151
We use debating tricks that we‚Äôve picked up throughout the years. Chief among them is the ability to ‚Äústack the deck.‚Äù We cite information that supports our ideas while hiding or discrediting anything that doesn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 151
Then we spice things up with exaggeration: ‚ÄúEveryone knows that this is the only way to go.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 151
When this doesn‚Äôt work, we lace our language with inflammatory terms: ‚ÄúAll right-thinking people would agree with me.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 151
We appeal to authority: ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs what the boss thinks.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 151
We draw hasty generalizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 151
And again, the harder we try and the more forceful and nasty our tactics, the greater the resistance we create, the worse the results, and the more battered our relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 151
When you find yourself just dying to convince others that your way is best, back off your current attack and think about what you really want for yourself, others, and the relationship. Then ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow would I behave if these were the results I really wanted?‚Äù When your adrenaline level gets below the 0.05 legal limit, you‚Äôll be able to use your STATE skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 152
First, Learn to Look. Watch for the moment when people start to resist you‚Äîperhaps they begin to raise their volume and/or overstate the facts behind their views in reaction to your tactics‚Äîor perhaps they retreat into silence. Turn your attention away from the topic (no matter how important) and onto yourself. Are you leaning forward? Are you speaking more loudly? Are you starting to try to win? Are you speaking in lengthy monologues and using dirty tricks? Remember: The more you care about an issue, the less likely you are to be on your best behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 152
Of course, this isn‚Äôt easy. Backing off when we care the most is so counterintuitive that most of us have trouble doing so. It‚Äôs not easy to soften your language when you‚Äôre positive about something. And who wants to ask for other views when you know they‚Äôre wrong? That‚Äôs positively nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 152
Let‚Äôs face it. When it comes to our strongest views, passion can be our enemy. Of course, feeling strongly about something isn‚Äôt bad in and of itself. It‚Äôs okay to have strong opinions. The problem comes when we try to express them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 153
Catch yourself. So what‚Äôs a person to do? Catch yourself before you launch into a monologue. Realize that if you‚Äôre starting to feel indignant or if you can‚Äôt figure out why others don‚Äôt buy in‚Äîafter all, it‚Äôs so obvious to you‚Äîrecognize that you‚Äôre starting to enter dangerous territory. Back off your harsh and conclusive language. But don‚Äôt back off your belief. Hold to your belief; merely soften your approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 157
when most people become furious, we need to become curious. Rather than respond in kind, we need to wonder what‚Äôs behind the ruckus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 157
But how? How can we possibly act curious when others are either attacking us or heading for cover? People who routinely seek to find out why others are feeling unsafe do so because they have learned that getting at the source of fear and discomfort is the best way to return to dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 157
Either they‚Äôve seen others do it or they‚Äôve stumbled on the formula themselves. Either way, they realize that the cure to silence or violence isn‚Äôt to respond in kind, but to get at the underlying source. This calls for genuine curiosity‚Äîat a time when you‚Äôre likely to be feeling frustrated or angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 158
Stay curious. When people begin to share their volatile stories and feelings, we now face the risk of pulling out our own Victim, Villain, and Helpless Stories to help us explain why they‚Äôre saying what they‚Äôre saying. Unfortunately, since it‚Äôs rarely fun to hear other people‚Äôs unflattering stories, we begin to assign negative motives to them for telling the stories. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 159
To avoid overreacting to others‚Äô stories, stay curious. Give your brain a problem to stay focused on. Ask: ‚ÄúWhy would a reasonable, rational, and decent person say this?‚Äù This question keeps you retracing the other person‚Äôs Path to Action until you see how it all fits together. And in most&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 159
Be patient. When others are acting out their feelings and opinions through silence or violence, it‚Äôs a good bet they‚Äôre starting to feel the effects of adrenaline. Even if we do our best to safely and effectively respond to the other person‚Äôs verbal attack, we still have to face up to the fact that it‚Äôs going to take a little while for him or her to settle down. Say, for example, that a friend dumps out an ugly story and you treat it with respect and continue on with the conversation. Even if the two of you now share a similar view, it may seem like your friend is still pushing too hard. While it‚Äôs natural to move quickly from one thought to the next, strong emotions take a while to subside. Once the chemicals that fuel emotions are released, they hang around in the bloodstream for a time‚Äîin some cases, long after thoughts have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 159
So be patient when exploring how others think and feel. Encourage them to share their path and then wait for their emotions to catch up with the safety that you‚Äôve created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 159
Once you‚Äôve decided to maintain a curious approach, it‚Äôs time to help the other person retrace his or her Path to Action. Unfortunately, most of us fail to do so. That‚Äôs because when others start playing silence or violence games, we‚Äôre joining the conversation at the end of their Path to Action. They‚Äôve seen and heard things, told themselves a story or two, generated a feeling (possibly a mix of fear and anger or disappointment), and now they‚Äôre starting to act out their story. That‚Äôs where we come in. Now, even though we may be hearing their first words, we‚Äôre coming in somewhere near the end of their path. On the Path to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 160
Every sentence has a history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 161
Break the cycle. And then guess what happens? When we‚Äôre on the receiving end of someone‚Äôs retributions, accusations, and cheap shots, rarely do we think: ‚ÄúMy, what an interesting story he or she must have told. What do you suppose led to that?‚Äù Instead, we match this unhealthy behavior. Our genetically shaped, eons-old defense mechanisms kick in, and we create our own hasty and ugly Path to Action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 161

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 163
saying one thing, his or her tone of voice or body posture suggests something else. In doing so, by staying with the observed actions, we show both respect and concern for him or her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 165
Asking people what they want helps them engage their brains in a way that moves to problem solving and away from either attacking or avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 168
So you ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat do I really want?‚Äù As you mull this question over, your motives change. The goals of controlling Wendy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 170
As you watch families and work groups take part in heated debates, it‚Äôs common to notice a rather intriguing phenomenon. Although the various parties you‚Äôre observing are violently arguing, in truth, they‚Äôre in violent agreement. They actually agree on every important point, but they‚Äôre still fighting. They‚Äôve found a way to turn subtle differences into a raging debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 171
Most arguments consist of battles over the 5 to 10 percent of the facts and stories that people disagree over. And while it‚Äôs true that people eventually need to work through differences, you shouldn‚Äôt start there. Start with an area of agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 171
So here‚Äôs the take-away. If you completely agree with the other person‚Äôs path, say so and move on. Agree when you agree. Don‚Äôt turn an agreement into an argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 171
Of course, the reason most of us turn agreements into debates is because we disagree with a certain portion of what the other person has said. Never mind that it‚Äôs a minor portion. If it‚Äôs a point of disagreement, we‚Äôll jump all over it like a fleeing criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 171
it first is even better. And of course, having it first after others are wrong endows you with an even greater glory! Over time you find that finding even the tiniest of errors in others‚Äô facts, thinking, or logic reinforces your supreme place in the spotlight of teacher and peer admiration. So you point out their errors. Being right at the expense of others becomes skillful sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 171
On the other hand, when you watch people who are skilled in dialogue, it becomes clear that they‚Äôre not playing this everyday game of Trivial Pursuit‚Äîlooking for trivial differences and then proclaiming them aloud. In fact, they‚Äôre looking for points of agreement. As a result, they‚Äôll often start with the words ‚ÄúI agree.‚Äù Then they talk about the part they agree with. At least, that‚Äôs where they start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 172
Now when the other person has merely left out an element of the argument, skilled people will agree and then build. Rather than saying: ‚ÄúWrong. You forgot to mention . . .,‚Äù they say: ‚ÄúAbsolutely. In addition, I noticed that. .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 172
If you agree with what has been said but the information is incomplete, build. Point out areas of agreement, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 172
then add elements that were left out of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 172
Finally, if you do disagree, compare your path with the other person‚Äôs. That is, rather than suggesting that he or she is wrong, suggest that you differ. He or she may, in fact, be wrong, but you don‚Äôt know for sure until you hear both sides of the story. For now, you just know that the two of you differ. So instead of pronouncing ‚ÄúWrong!‚Äù start with a tentative but candid opening, such as ‚ÄúI think I see things differently. Let me describe how.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 172
In summary, to help remember these skills, think of your ABCs. Agree when you agree. Build when others leave out key pieces. Compare when you differ. Don‚Äôt turn differences into debates that lead to unhealthy relationships and bad results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 178
They have unclear expectations about how decisions will be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 178
‚Ä¢ They do a poor job of acting on the decisions they do make. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 179
Both of these problems are solved if, before making a decision, the people involved decide how to decide. Don‚Äôt allow people to assume that dialogue is decision making. Dialogue is a process for getting all relevant meaning into a shared pool. That process, of course, involves everyone. However, simply because everyone is allowed to share their meaning‚Äîactually encouraged to share their meaning‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt mean they are then guaranteed to take part in making all the decisions. To avoid violated expectations, separate dialogue from decision making. Make it clear how decisions will be made‚Äîwho will be involved and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 179
When the line of authority isn‚Äôt clear. When there is no clear line of authority, deciding how to decide can be quite difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 180
Don‚Äôt mention lawyers or a lawsuit in your opening comments; this only reduces safety and sets up an adversarial climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 180
There are four common ways of making decisions: command, consult, vote, and consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 181
Consulting is a process whereby decision makers invite others to influence them before they make their choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 182
Consensus This method can be both a great blessing and a frustrating curse. Consensus means you talk until everyone honestly agrees to one decision. This method can produce tremendous unity and high-quality decisions. If misapplied, it can also be a horrible waste of time. It should only be used with (1) high-stakes and complex issues or (2) issues where everyone absolutely must support the final choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 184
Be sure to spell out the exact deliverables you have in mind. The fuzzier the expectations, the higher the likelihood of disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 185
assignment, clarify up front the exact details of what you want. Couples get into trouble in this area when one of the parties doesn‚Äôt want to take the time to think carefully about the ‚Äúdeliverables‚Äù and then later on becomes upset because his or her unstated desires weren‚Äôt met. Have you ever remodeled a room with a loved one? Then you know what we‚Äôre talking about. Better to spend the time up front clarifying exactly what you want rather than waste resources and hurt feelings on the back end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 186
It‚Äôs shocking how often people leave this element out of an assignment. Instead of giving a deadline, people simply point to the setting sun of ‚Äúsomeday.‚Äù With vague or unspoken deadlines, other urgencies come up, and the assignment finds its way to the bottom of the pile, where it is soon forgotten. Assignments without deadlines are far better at producing guilt than stimulating action. Goals without deadlines aren‚Äôt goals; they‚Äôre merely directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 186
Remember, if you want people to feel accountable, you must give them an opportunity to account. Build an expectation for follow-up into every assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 186
Once again, a proverb comes to mind. ‚ÄúOne dull pencil is worth six sharp minds.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 191
When you feel a measure of respect for the other person, you‚Äôre ready to begin. After establishing a Mutual Purpose for the exchange, STATE your path. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 191
‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to talk about something that‚Äôs getting in the way of my working with you. It‚Äôs a tough issue to bring up, but I think it‚Äôll help us be better teammates if I do. Is that okay?‚Äù [Establish Mutual Purpose]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 192
This is generally a problem of not knowing how to STATE Your Path. When something bothers you, catch it early. Contrasting can also help. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to blow this out of proportion. I just want to deal with it before it gets out of hand.‚Äù Describe the specific behaviors you‚Äôve observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 192
When spouses stop giving each other helpful feedback, they lose out on the help of a lifelong confidant and coach. They miss out on hundreds of opportunities to help each other communicate more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Page: 194
Despite this disclaimer, the way they carry themselves, their habit of speaking in absolutes, their subtle use of authority‚Äîsomething out there‚Äîis creating fear and eventual deference.&lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately for us, after analyzing their results, Mandel and Johnson were in a position to deliver a stunningly simple answer to the ‚ÄúYeah, but how?‚Äù question. In an article largely overlooked since it was published in 2002, they described how they were able to draw website visitors‚Äô attention to the goal of comfort merely by placing fluffy clouds on the background wallpaper of the site‚Äôs landing page. That maneuver led those visitors to assign elevated levels of importance to comfort when asked what they were looking for in a sofa. Those same visitors also became more likely to search the site for information about the comfort features of the sofas in stock and, most notably, to choose a more comfortable (and more costly) sofa as their preferred purchase. To make sure their results were due to the landing page wallpaper and not to some general human preference for comfort, Mandel and Johnson reversed their procedure for other visitors, who saw wallpaper that pulled their attention to the goal of economy by depicting pennies instead of clouds. These visitors assigned greater levels of importance to price, searched the site primarily for cost information, and preferred an inexpensive sofa.&lt;/p&gt;

Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 20
The tapper/listener experiment is reenacted every day across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 20
There are, in fact, only two ways to beat the Curse of Knowledge reliably. The first is not to learn anything. The second is to take your ideas and transform them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 22
They found that 89 percent of the award-winning ads could be classified into six basic categories, or templates. That‚Äôs remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 22
Most of these templates relate to the principle of unexpectedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 23
The surprising lesson of this story: Highly creative ads are more predictable than uncreative ones. It‚Äôs like Tolstoy‚Äôs quote: ‚ÄúAll happy families resemble each other, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.‚Äù All creative ads resemble one another, but each loser is uncreative in its own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 23
if creative ads consistently make use of the same basic set of templates, perhaps ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù can be taught. Perhaps even novices‚Äîwith no creative experience‚Äîcould produce better ideas if they understood the templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 23
experienced creativity instructor who showed the participants how to use a free-association brainstorming method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 23
This technique is a standard method for teaching creativity; it‚Äôs supposed to broaden associations, spark unexpected connections,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 23
The final group was trained for two hours on how to use the six creative templates. Once again, the fifteen best ads were selected by the creative director and tested with consumers. Suddenly these novices sprouted creativity. Their ads were rated as 50 percent more creative and produced a 55 percent more positive attitude toward the products advertised. This is a stunning improvement for a two-hour investment in learning a few basic templates! It appears that there are indeed systematic ways to produce creative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 24
WHAT THIS ISRAELI research team did for advertisements is what this book does for your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 24
But isn‚Äôt the use of a template or a checklist confining? Surely we‚Äôre not arguing that a ‚Äúcolor by numbers‚Äù approach will yield more creative work than a blank-canvas approach? Actually, yes, that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre saying. If you want to spread your ideas to other people, you should work within the confines of the rules that have allowed other ideas to succeed over time. You want to invent new ideas, not new rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 25
‚ÄúThe trite expression we always use is No plan survives contact with the enemy,‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 26
Army adapted its planning process, inventing a concept called Commander‚Äôs Intent (CI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 27
What we mean by ‚Äúsimple‚Äù is finding the core of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 28
The French aviator and author Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry once offered a definition of engineering elegance: ‚ÄúA designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 30
News reporters are taught to start their stories with the most important information. The first sentence, called the lead,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 30
contains the most essential elements of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 32
‚ÄúThe longer you work on a story, the more you can find yourself losing direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 32
Forced prioritization is really painful. Smart people recognize the value of all the material. They see nuance, multiple perspectives‚Äîand because they fully appreciate the complexities of a situation, they‚Äôre often tempted to linger there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 32
This tendency to gravitate toward complexity is perpetually at war with the need to prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 34
psychologists have found that people can be driven to irrational decisions by too much complexity and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 37
Prioritization rescues people from the quicksand of decision angst, and that‚Äôs why finding the core is so valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 37
Core messages help people avoid bad choices by reminding them of what‚Äôs important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 41
PUNCH LINE: Avoid burying the lead. Don‚Äôt start with something interesting but irrelevant in hopes of entertaining the audience. Instead, work to make the core message itself more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 42
Adams was born with ink in his blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 43
That‚Äôs the one thing we can do better than anybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 44
When somebody tells you, ‚ÄúAw, you don‚Äôt want all those names,‚Äù please assure them that‚Äôs exactly what we want, most of all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 45
For fifty-five years, since Adams founded the paper, his core value of community focus has helped hundreds of people at the paper, in thousands of circumstances, make good decisions. As a publisher, Adams has presided over close to 20,000 issues. And&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 45
Adams‚Äôs Commander‚Äôs Intent is clear: ‚ÄúNames, names, and names.‚Äù Adams can‚Äôt be everywhere. But by finding the core and communicating it clearly, he has made himself everywhere. That‚Äôs the power of a sticky idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 46
It‚Äôs a bandwidth issue: The more we reduce the amount of information in an idea, the stickier it will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 48
we‚Äôre chasing in this chapter: ideas that are compact enough to be sticky and meaningful enough to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 48

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 52
If remembering was like weight lifting, it would be ridiculous to think we could ‚Äúlift‚Äù JFK easier than three little letters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 52
We‚Äôve already built those muscles‚Äîthe concept of JFK, and all its associations, is already embedded in our memories. What we‚Äôre remembering is simply a pointer to this information‚Äîwe‚Äôre posting a little flag on the terrain of our memory. With the raw letters, we‚Äôre posting three separate flags. In the end, it‚Äôs one bit of information (or one flag) versus three, and it‚Äôs no surprise that one is easier to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 52
You use flags. You tap the existing memory terrain of your audience. You use what‚Äôs already there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 53
How do you turn a freshman into an architect? How does complexity emerge from simplicity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 53
If simple ideas are staged and layered correctly, they can very quickly become complex. Let us teach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 53
EXPLANATION 2: A pomelo is basically a supersized grapefruit with a very thick and soft rind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 54
Explanation 2 sticks a flag on a concept that you already know: a grapefruit. When we tell you that a pomelo is like a grapefruit, you call up a mental image of a grapefruit. Then we tell you what to change about it: It‚Äôs ‚Äúsupersized.‚Äù Your visualized grapefruit grows accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 61
Generative metaphors and proverbs both derive their power from a clever substitution: They substitute something easy to think about for something difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 64
The first problem of communication is getting people‚Äôs attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 64
The most basic way to get someone‚Äôs attention is this: Break a pattern. Humans adapt incredibly quickly to consistent patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 65
Our brain is designed to be keenly aware of changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 65
when products require users to pay attention, something changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 65
This chapter focuses on two essential questions: How do I get people‚Äôs attention? And, just as crucially, How do I keep it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 65
To understand the answers to these two questions, we have to understand two essential emotions‚Äîsurprise and interest‚Äîthat are commonly provoked by naturally sticky ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 67
Our schemas are like guessing machines. Schemas help us predict what will happen and, consequently, how we should make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 67
Emotions are elegantly tuned to help us deal with critical situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 67
For instance, a secondary effect of being angry, which was recently discovered by researchers, is that we become more certain of our judgments. When we‚Äôre angry, we know we‚Äôre right, as anyone who has been in a relationship can attest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 67
So if emotions have biological purposes, then what is the biological purpose of surprise? Surprise jolts us to attention. Surprise is triggered when our schemas fail, and it prepares us to understand why the failure occurred. When our guessing machines fail, surprise grabs our attention so that we can repair them for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 68
a book called Unmasking the Face, Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen coined a term, ‚Äúthe surprise brow,‚Äù to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 68
When our brows go up, it widens our eyes and gives us a broader field of vision‚Äîthe surprise brow is our body‚Äôs way of forcing us to see more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 68
Unexpected ideas are more likely to stick because surprise makes us pay attention and think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 68
Surprise can prompt us to hunt for underlying causes, to imagine other possibilities, to figure out how to avoid surprises in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 71
The emotion of surprise is designed to focus our attention on the failure, so that we can improve our guessing machines for the future. Then we drew a distinction between gimmicky surprise, like dot-com ads, and meaningful post-dictable surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 71
you‚Äôve got to break someone‚Äôs guessing machine and then fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 71
is to make sure you target an aspect of your audience‚Äôs guessing machines that relates to your core message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 76
Finally, he said, ‚ÄúThe lead to the story is ‚ÄòThere will be no school next Thursday.‚Äô‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 76
‚ÄúIn that instant I realized that journalism was not just about regurgitating the facts but about figuring out the point. It wasn‚Äôt enough to know the who, what, when, and where; you had to understand what it meant. And why it mattered.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 80
We began this chapter with two questions: How do we get people‚Äôs attention? And how do we keep it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 80
‚ÄúI also found something I had not expected‚Äîthe most successful of these pieces all began with a mystery story. The authors described a state of affairs that seemed to make no sense and then invited the reader into the material as a way of solving the mystery.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 81
Mysteries are powerful, Cialdini says, because they create a need for closure. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve heard of the famous Aha! experience, right?‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWell, the Aha! experience is much more satisfying when it is preceded by the Huh? experience.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 81
Cialdini began to create mysteries in his own classroom, and the power of the approach quickly became clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 81
‚ÄúNormally five to ten minutes before the scheduled end time, some students start preparing to leave. You know the signals‚Äîpencils are put away, notebooks folded, backpacks zipped up.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 82
Cialdini believes that a major benefit of teaching using mysteries is that ‚Äúthe process of resolving mysteries is remarkably similar to the process of science.‚Äù So, by using mysteries, teachers don‚Äôt just heighten students‚Äô interest in the day‚Äôs material; they train them to think like scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 82
Mystery is created not from an unexpected moment but from an unexpected journey. We know where we‚Äôre headed‚Äîwe want to solve the mystery‚Äîbut we‚Äôre not sure how we‚Äôll get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 83
McKee says, ‚ÄúCuriosity11 is the intellectual need to answer questions and close open patterns. Story plays to this universal desire by doing the opposite, posing questions and opening situations.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 83
In McKee‚Äôs view, a great script is designed so that every scene is a Turning Point. ‚ÄúEach Turning Point hooks curiosity. The audience wonders, What will happen next? and How will it turn out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 83
McKee notes that the How will it turn out? question is powerful enough to keep us watching even when we know better. ‚ÄúThink of all the bad films you‚Äôve sat through just to get the answer to that nagging question.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 84
In 1994, George Loewenstein,12 a behavioral economist at Carnegie Mellon University, provided the most comprehensive account of situational interest. It is surprisingly simple. Curiosity, he says, happens when we feel a gap in our knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 84
Loewenstein argues that gaps cause pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 85
‚ÄúStory works by posing questions and opening situations.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 85
Pok√©mon cards cause kids to wonder, Which characters am I missing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 85
One important implication of the gap theory is that we need to open gaps before we close them. Our tendency is to tell people the facts. First, though, they must realize that they need these facts. The trick to convincing people that they need our message, according to Loewenstein, is to first highlight some specific knowledge that they‚Äôre missing. We can pose a question or puzzle that confronts people with a gap in their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 85
We can point out that someone else knows something they don‚Äôt. We can present them with situations that have unknown resolutions, such as elections, sports events, or mysteries. We can challenge them to predict an outcome (which creates two knowledge gaps‚ÄîWhat will happen? and Was I right?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 85
They work because they tease you with something that you don‚Äôt know‚Äîin fact, something that you didn‚Äôt care about at all, until you found out that you didn‚Äôt know it. ‚ÄúIs my daughter strung out on one of my old prescriptions? I wonder if I ate at the restaurant with the slime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 86
In improving this message, we need to think about how to elicit interest rather than force-feeding facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 87
This approach is inspired by the gap theory. The goal is not to summarize; it‚Äôs to make you care about knowing something, and then to tell you what you want to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 87
The improvement here is driven by structure, not content. Let‚Äôs face it, this is not a particularly interesting mystery. It would never make an episode of Law &amp;amp; Order. But our minds are extremely generous when it comes to mysteries‚Äîthe format is inherently appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 88
The news-teaser approach can be used with all sorts of ideas in all sorts of contexts. To make our communications more effective, we need to shift our thinking from ‚ÄúWhat information do I need to convey?‚Äù to ‚ÄúWhat questions do I want my audience to ask?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 88
know. One complication is that people tend to think they know a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 88
If people believe they know everything, it‚Äôs hard to make the gap theory work. Fortunately, there are strategies for combating overconfidence. For instance, Nora Ephron‚Äôs journalism teacher prevented overconfidence by causing the students‚Äô schemas of journalism to fail. He made them commit to their preconceived ideas and then pulled the rug out from under them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 88
Making people commit to a prediction can help prevent overconfidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 89
Eric Mazur, a physics professor at Harvard, came up with a pedagogical innovation known as ‚Äúconcept testing.‚Äù Every so often in his classes, Mazur will pose a conceptual question and then ask his students to vote publicly on the answer. The simple act of committing to an answer makes the students more engaged and more curious about the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 89
The thirst to fill a knowledge gap‚Äîto find out who was right‚Äîcan be more powerful than the thirst for slides and jungle gyms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 89
If curiosity arises from knowledge gaps, we might assume that when we know more, we‚Äôll become less curious because there are fewer gaps in our knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 89
But Loewenstein argues that the opposite is true. He says that as we gain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 89
information we are more and more likely to focus on what we don‚Äôt know. Someone who knows the state capitals of 17 of 50 states may be proud of her knowledge. But someone who knows 47 may be more likely to think of herself as not knowing 3 capitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 90
Human-interest stories are fascinating because we know what it‚Äôs like to be human‚Äîbut we don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to have certain dramatic experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 90
Gossip is popular because we know a lot about some people but there‚Äôs some information that we lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 91
The trick, Arledge said, was to give people enough context about the game so that they‚Äôd start to care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 91
Arledge intuitively made use of Loewenstein‚Äôs gap theory. How do you get people interested in a topic? You point out a gap in their knowledge. But what if they lack so much knowledge about, say, the Georgia Bulldogs, that they‚Äôve got more of an abyss than a gap? In that case, you have to fill in enough knowledge to make the abyss into a gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 92
The tool kit he developed for NCAA football stood the test of time. The way to get people to care is to provide context. Today that seems obvious, because these techniques have become ubiquitous. But this avalanche of context started because a twenty-nine-year-old wrote a memo about how to make college football more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 92
Knowledge gaps create interest. But to prove that the knowledge gaps exist, it may be necessary to highlight some knowledge first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 93
‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what you know. Now here‚Äôs what you‚Äôre missing.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 93
Alternatively, you can set context so people care what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 93
Unexpected ideas, by opening a knowledge gap, tease and flirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 93
They mark a big red X on something that needs to be discovered but don‚Äôt necessarily tell you how to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 96
In Kennedy‚Äôs address to Congress, he outlined a series of requests to help the United States maintain its leadership during the Cold War. He asked for funds to achieve a number of strategic goals: to establish the AID program for international development, to expand the NATO alliance, to build radio and television stations in Latin America and Southeast Asia, and to shore up civil defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 96
next, the ideas give us a sudden, dramatic glimpse of how the world might unfold. And not just how but why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 96
it‚Äôs important to remember that knowledge gaps are painful. ‚ÄúIf people like curiosity,15 why do they work to resolve it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 97
When we‚Äôre skeptical about our ability to get people‚Äôs attention, or our ability to keep people‚Äôs attention, we should draw inspiration from Kennedy and Ibuka. And, on a smaller scale, from Nora Ephron‚Äôs journalism teacher and Nordstrom‚Äôs managers. Unexpectedness, in the service of core principles, can have surprising longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 99
Clearly, Aesop was illustrating a universal human shortcoming. The fable would not have survived for more than 2,500 years if it didn‚Äôt reflect some profound truth about human nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 99
This truth is especially sticky because of the way it was encoded. The concrete images evoked by the fable‚Äîthe grapes, the fox, the dismissive comment about sour grapes‚Äîallowed its message to persist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 99

Language is often abstract, but life is not abstract. Teachers teach students about battles and animals and books. Doctors repair problems with our stomachs, backs, and hearts. Companies create software, build planes, distribute newspapers; they build cars that are cheaper, faster, or fancier than last year‚Äôs. Even the most abstract business strategy must eventually show up in the tangible actions of human beings. It‚Äôs easier to understand those tangible actions than to understand an abstract strategy statement‚Äîjust as it‚Äôs easier to understand a fox dissing some grapes than an abstract commentary about the human psyche.&lt;/p&gt;

California is one of only five Mediterranean climate regions in the world. (The others are the fynbos of South Africa, the matorral of Chile, the kwongan of Australia, and, of course, the Mediterranean.) These Mediterranean climate zones occupy only 2 percent of the world‚Äôs landmass but host more than 20 percent of its plant species. If you want to buy environmentally precious land, Mediterranean climates give you a lot of bang for your buck.&lt;/p&gt;

These new strategies made sense‚ÄîTNC could protect more areas than it could reach through ‚Äúbucks and acres.‚Äù But they also had drawbacks. First, they were much less concrete to donors.

How could TNC make the new strategy more concrete?&lt;/p&gt;

This is not a story about land; it‚Äôs a story about abstraction. TNC avoided the trap of abstraction‚Äîsaving 2 million acres per year‚Äîby converting abstract blobs on a map into tangible landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;

Concrete language helps people, especially novices, understand new concepts. Abstraction is the luxury of the expert.&lt;/p&gt;

If you‚Äôve got to teach an idea to a room full of people, and you aren‚Äôt certain what they know, concreteness is the only safe language.&lt;/p&gt;

Yale researcher Eric Havelock3 studies tales that have been passed down by word of mouth, such as the Iliad and the Odyssey. He notes that these tales are characterized by lots of concrete actions, with few abstractions. Why? The ancient Greeks certainly had no problem with abstraction‚Äîthis was the society that produced Plato and Aristotle, after all. Havelock believes that the stories evolved away from abstraction over time. When they were passed along from generation to generation, the more memorable concrete details survived and the abstractions evaporated.&lt;/p&gt;

To build such machinery, the firm needed two sets of skills: engineers who could create brilliant designs, and skilled manufacturing people who could transform those designs into complex physical machines. If the firm was to succeed, these two sets of people had to be able to communicate smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

It‚Äôs easy to lose awareness that we‚Äôre talking like an expert. We start to suffer from the Curse of Knowledge, like the tappers in the ‚Äútappers and listeners‚Äù game. It can feel unnatural to speak concretely about subject matter we‚Äôve known intimately for years. But if we‚Äôre willing to make the effort we‚Äôll see the rewards: Our audience will understand what we‚Äôre saying and remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 115
the moral of the story is to find a ‚Äúuniversal language,‚Äù one that everyone speaks fluently. Inevitably, that universal language will be concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

When Boeing prepared to launch the design of the 727 passenger plane in the 1960s, its managers set a goal that was deliberately concrete: The 727 must seat 131 passengers,8 fly nonstop from Miami to New York City, and land on Runway 4-22 at La Guardia. (The 4-22 runway was chosen for its length‚Äîless than a mile, which was much too short for any of the existing passenger jets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 116
With a goal this concrete, Boeing effectively coordinated the actions&lt;/p&gt;

Why does this happen? Because concreteness is a way of mobilizing and focusing your brain. For another example of this phenomenon, consider these two statements: (1) Think of five silly things that people have done in the world in the past ten years. (2) Think about five silly things your child has done in the past ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 123
Concreteness creates a shared ‚Äúturf‚Äù on which people can collaborate. Everybody in the room feels comfortable that they‚Äôre tackling the same challenge. Even experts‚Äîeven the Kleiner Perkins venture capitalists, the rock stars of the technology world‚Äîbenefit from concrete talk that puts them on common ground.&lt;/p&gt;

To be simple‚Äîto find our core message‚Äîis quite difficult. (It‚Äôs certainly worth the effort, but let‚Äôs not kid ourselves that it‚Äôs easy.) Crafting our ideas in an unexpected way takes a fair amount of effort and applied creativity. But being concrete isn‚Äôt hard, and it doesn‚Äôt require a lot of effort. The barrier is simply forgetfulness‚Äîwe forget that we‚Äôre slipping into abstractspeak. We forget that other people don‚Äôt know what we know. We‚Äôre the engineers who keep flipping back to our drawings, not noticing that the assemblers just want us to follow them down to the factory floor.&lt;/p&gt;

So far we‚Äôve talked about creating credibility by drawing on external sources‚Äîauthorities and antiauthorities. And we‚Äôve talked about creating credibility by drawing on sources inside the message itself‚Äîby using details and statistics and examples that pass the Sinatra Test. But there‚Äôs one remaining source of credibility that we haven‚Äôt discussed. And it may be the most powerful source of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 156
The ads were a refreshing departure from the standard advertiser tool kit that attempts to paint powerful but irrelevant emotions on consumer goods‚Äîfor instance, associating a mother‚Äôs love of her children with a particular brand of fabric softener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 156
Wendy‚Äôs did something more admirable: It highlighted a genuine advantage of its product and presented it in an enjoyable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 156
the commercials developed a brand-new source of credibility: the audience. Wendy‚Äôs outsourced its credibility to its customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 157
The spots implicitly challenged customers to verify Wendy‚Äôs claims: See for yourself‚Äîlook at our burgers versus McDonald‚Äôs burgers. You‚Äôll notice the size difference!&lt;/p&gt;

Testable credentials can provide an enormous credibility boost, since they essentially allow your audience members to ‚Äútry before they buy.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

Testable credentials are useful in many domains. For example, take the question ‚ÄúAre you better off now than you were four years ago?‚Äù Ronald Reagan famously posed this question to the audience during his 1980 presidential debate with Jimmy Carter.&lt;/p&gt;

event, to judge the event‚Äôs probability by its availability in our memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 160
We intuitively think that events are more likely when they are easier to remember. But often the things we remember are not an accurate summary of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 163
But what‚Äôs more likely to stick with someone: hearing about someone who fooled someone else, or being fooled yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 163
It‚Äôs not always obvious which wellspring of credibility we should draw from. What Marshall showed so brilliantly was perseverance‚Äîknowing when it was time to draw on a different well. In this chapter we‚Äôve seen that the most obvious sources of credibility‚Äîexternal validation and statistics‚Äîaren‚Äôt always the best. A few vivid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 164
details might be more persuasive than a barrage of statistics. An antiauthority might work better than an authority. A single story that passes the Sinatra Test might overcome a mountain of skepticism. It‚Äôs inspirational to know that a medical genius like Marshall had to climb over the same hurdles with his idea as we‚Äôll have to climb with ours‚Äîand to see that he eventually prevailed, to the benefit of us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 167
The researchers theorized that thinking about statistics shifts people into a more analytical frame of mind. When people think analytically, they‚Äôre less likely to think emotionally. And the researchers believed it was people‚Äôs emotional response to Rokia‚Äôs plight that led them to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 167
When people were primed to feel before they read about Rokia, they gave $2.34, about the same as before. But when they were primed to calculate before they read about Rokia, they gave $1.26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 167
These results are shocking. The mere act of calculation reduced people‚Äôs charity. Once we put on our analytical hat, we react to emotional appeals differently. We hinder our ability to feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 168
IN THE LAST chapter, we discussed how to convince people that our ideas are credible, how to make them believe. Belief counts for a lot, but belief isn‚Äôt enough. For people to take action, they have to care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 169
Rather, the goal of making messages ‚Äúemotional‚Äù is to make people care. Feelings inspire people to act.&lt;/p&gt;

Caples says companies often emphasize features when they should be emphasizing benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 179
‚ÄúThe most frequent reason for unsuccessful advertising is advertisers who are so full of their own accomplishments (the world‚Äôs best seed!) that they forget to tell us why we should buy (the world‚Äôs best&lt;/p&gt;

It‚Äôs important, Caples says, to keep the self in self-interest: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say, ‚ÄòPeople will enjoy12 a sense of security when they use Goodyear Tires.‚Äô Say, ‚ÄòYou enjoy a sense of security when you use Goodyear Tires.‚Äô&lt;/p&gt;

avoid talking about abstract benefits (‚ÄúPeople will enjoy a sense of security when they use Goodyear Tires‚Äù) and focus on personal benefits (‚ÄúYou enjoy a sense of security when you use Goodyear Tires‚Äù).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 181

Abraham Maslow14 surveyed the research in psychology about what motivates people.&lt;/p&gt;

The second question tested two versions of his greed appeal: ‚ÄúWould your firefighters prefer a large electric popcorn popper or an excellent set of chef‚Äôs carving knives as a thank-you for reviewing the film?‚Äù The first two calls yielded definitive answers to this question: ‚ÄúDo you think we‚Äôd use a fire safety program because of some #*$@%! popcorn popper?!‚Äù The marketer stopped asking about the free gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 189
But self-interest isn‚Äôt the whole story. Principles‚Äîequality, individualism, ideals about government, human rights, and the like‚Äîmay matter to us even when they violate our immediate self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 189
And perhaps the most important part of the story is this: ‚ÄúGroup interest‚Äù is often a better predictor of political opinions than self-interest. Kinder says that in forming opinions people seem to ask not ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in it for me?‚Äù but, rather, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in it for my group?‚Äù Our group affiliation may be based on race, class, religion, gender, region, political party, industry, or countless other dimensions of difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 190
This model is the standard view of decision-making in economics classes: People are self-interested and rational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 190
The second model is quite different. It assumes that people make decisions based on identity. They ask themselves three questions: Who am I? What kind of situation is this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 190
And what do people like me do in this kind of situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 190
There are no calculations, only norms and principles. Which sofa would someone like me‚Äîa Southeastern accountant‚Äîbe more likely to buy? Which political candidate should a Hollywood Buddhist get behind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 191
But from the perspective of the identity model of decision-making, turning down the popper makes perfect sense. The thought process would be more like this: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a firefighter. You‚Äôre offering me a popcorn popper to get me to view a film on safety. But firefighters aren‚Äôt the kind of people who need little gifts to motivate us to learn about safety. We risk our lives, going into burning buildings to save people. Shame on you for implying that I need a popcorn popper!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 191
to unite these two decision models. What if the marketer had offered to donate fifty dollars to a school‚Äôs fire-safety program in exchange for the firemen‚Äôs viewing the film? It‚Äôs less clear that this offer would have violated the firefighters‚Äô sense of identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 243
One of the worst things about knowing a lot, or having access to a lot of information, is that we‚Äôre tempted to share it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 244
The second villain is the tendency to focus on the presentation rather than on the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 244
The first is decision paralysis‚Äîthe anxiety and irrationality that can emerge from excessive choice or ambiguous situations. Think about the students who missed both a fantastic lecture and a great film because they couldn‚Äôt decide which one was better, or how hard it was for Jeff Hawkins, the leader of the Palm Pilot development group, to get his team to focus on a few issues rather than on many. To beat decision paralysis, communicators have to do the hard work of finding the core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 244
The archvillain of sticky ideas, as you know by now, is the Curse of Knowledge. The Stanford students didn‚Äôt face the Curse of Knowledge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 244
them‚Äîthey were more akin to reporters trying to avoid burying the lead on a news story than to experts who have forgotten what it‚Äôs like not to know something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 244
The Curse of Knowledge is a worthy adversary, because in some sense it‚Äôs inevitable. Getting a message across has two stages: the Answer stage and the Telling Others stage. In the Answer stage, you use your expertise to arrive at the idea that you want to share. Doctors study for a decade to be capable of giving the Answer. Business managers may deliberate for months to arrive at the Answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 245
Here‚Äôs the rub: The same factors that worked to your advantage in the Answer stage will backfire on you during the Telling Others stage. To get the Answer, you need expertise, but you can‚Äôt dissociate expertise from the Curse of Knowledge. You know things that others don‚Äôt know, and you can‚Äôt remember what it was like not to know those things. So when you get around to sharing the Answer, you‚Äôll tend to communicate as if your audience were you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 245
There is a curious disconnect between the amount of time we invest in training people how to arrive at the Answer and the amount of time we invest in training them how to Tell Others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:made a good point&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 245
College professors take dozens of courses in their areas of expertise but none on how to teach.&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of engineers would scoff at a training program about Telling Others.&lt;/p&gt;

If they‚Äôre good speakers, they may even have created an enhanced sense,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 246
They‚Äôve shared data, but they haven‚Äôt created ideas that are useful and lasting. Nothing stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 246
Framework For an idea to stick, for it to be useful and lasting, it‚Äôs got to make the audience: Pay attention Understand and remember it Agree/Believe Care Be able to act on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 247
‚ÄúNo one is listening to me‚Äù or ‚ÄúThey seem bored‚Äîthey hear this stuff all the time.‚Äù SOLUTION: Surprise them by breaking their guessing machines‚Äîtell them something that is uncommon sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 248
Create curiosity gaps‚Äîtell people just enough for them to realize the piece that‚Äôs missing from their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 248
Or create mysteries or puzzles that are slowly solved over the course of the communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 248
Make the message simpler and use concrete language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 248
Or use concrete, real-world examples. Don‚Äôt talk about ‚Äúknowledge management‚Äù; tell a story about a health worker in Zambia getting information on malaria from the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 248
Create a highly concrete turf where people can apply their knowledge. (Think of the venture-capital pitch for a portable computer where the entrepreneur tossed his binder onto the table, sparking brainstorming.) Have people grapple with specific examples or cases rather than concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 248
Find the telling details for your message‚Äîthe equivalent of the dancing seventy-three-year-old man, or the textile factory so environmentally friendly that it actually cleans the water pouring through it. Use fewer authorities and more antiauthorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 249
‚ÄúThey quibble with everything I say‚Äù or ‚ÄúI spend all my time arguing with them about this.‚Äù SOLUTION: Quiet the audience‚Äôs mental skeptics by using a springboard story, switching them into creative mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 249
Move away from statistics and facts toward meaningful examples. Use an&lt;/p&gt;

anecdote that passes the Sinatra Test.&lt;/p&gt;

Remember the Mother Teresa effect‚Äîpeople care more about individuals than they do about abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 249
Tell them an inspiring Challenge plot or Creativity plot story. Tap into their sense of their own identities, like the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Mess with Texas‚Äù ads, which suggested that not littering was the Texan thing to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 249
‚ÄúThe things that used to get people excited just aren‚Äôt doing it anymore.‚Äù SOLUTION: Get out of Maslow‚Äôs basement and try appealing to more profound types of self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;

Beat decision paralysis through relentless prioritization: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the economy, stupid.‚Äù Clinic: Sun exposure. Names, names, names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 253
Simple = core + compact. Proverbs: sound bites that are profound. Visual proverbs: The Palm Pilot wood block. How to pack a lot of punch into a compact communication: (1) Using what‚Äôs there: Tap into existing schemas. The pomelo. (2) Create a high concept pitch: ‚ÄúDie Hard on a bus.‚Äù (3) Use a generative analogy: Disney‚Äôs ‚Äúcast members.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 254
GET ATTENTION: SURPRISE. The successful flight safety announcement. Break a pattern!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 254
Break people‚Äôs guessing machines (on a core issue). The surprise brow: a pause to collect information. Avoid gimmicky surprise‚Äîmake it ‚Äúpostdictable.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Nordie who ‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThere will be no school next Thursday.‚Äù Clinic: Too much on foreign aid?&lt;/p&gt;

The Charisma Myth: Master the Art of Personal Magnetism

Yellow highlight | Location: 79
charisma is a skill that you can learn and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 85
It can determine whether you‚Äôre seen as a follower or a leader,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 85
whether your ideas get adopted, and how effectively your projects are implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 105
It‚Äôs Not Magic, It‚Äôs Learned Behaviors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 129
When you meet a charismatic person, you get the impression that they have a lot of power and they like you a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 131
impression that you possess both high power and high warmth, since charismatic behaviors project a combination of these two qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 132
‚ÄúFight or flight?‚Äù is the power question. ‚ÄúFriend or foe?‚Äù is the warmth question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 135
Presence is the single most requested aspect of charisma when I‚Äôm coaching executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 138
you not only feel his power and a sense of warm engagement, you also feel that he‚Äôs completely here with you, in this moment. Present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 145
It involves managing your mental ecosystem, understanding and attending to your own needs, as well as knowing which behaviors inspire others to see you as charismatic and learning how to project them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 153
The world will become your lab, and every time you meet someone, you‚Äôll get an opportunity to experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 164
‚ÄúAfter dining with Mr.¬†Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest person in England. But after dining with Mr.¬†Disraeli, I thought I was the cleverest person in England.‚Äù Guess who won the election? It was the man who made others feel intelligent, impressive, and fascinating: Benjamin Disraeli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 174
But introversion is not a terminal handicap. In fact, as we‚Äôll see, it can be a strong advantage for certain forms of charisma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 181
Last but not least, you won‚Äôt have to change your personality. In order to become more charismatic, you don‚Äôt have to force yourself into one particular personality style&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 185
Lower the intonation of your voice at the end of your sentences. Reduce how quickly and how often you nod. Pause for two full seconds before you speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 222
CHARISMATIC BEHAVIOR CAN be broken down into three core elements: presence, power, and warmth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 225
In order to be charismatic, we need to choose mental states that make our body language, words, and behaviors flow together and express the three core elements of charisma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 285
When you‚Äôre fully present, it shows in your body language in a highly charisma-enhancing way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 286
Being charismatic does not depend on how much time you have but on how fully present you are in each interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 288
The people you‚Äôre with feel that they have your full attention and that they are the most important thing in the world to you at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 298
‚ÄúIn most moments we have a continuous internal commentary on what is happening and what we should do next. We might greet a friend with a hug, but the warmth of our greeting becomes blurred by our computations about how long to embrace or what we‚Äôre going to say when we‚Äôre done. We rush through the motions, not fully present.‚Äù Being present enables you to fully notice and drink in the good moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 307
We look for clues of power in someone‚Äôs appearance, in others‚Äô reaction to this person, and, most of all, in the person‚Äôs body language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 308
others. Warmth tells us whether or not people will want to use whatever power they have in our favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 310
Warmth is assessed almost entirely through body language and behavior; it‚Äôs evaluated more directly than power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 322
warmth. The combination of power and warmth would have been very rare and very, very precious:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 327
From lab experiments to neuroimaging, research has consistently shown that they are the two dimensions we evaluate first and foremost in assessing other people.3 Both power and warmth are necessary conditions for charisma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 341
Though this may sound incredible‚Äîhow could words carry so little weight compared to the body language of the person delivering them?‚Äîit actually makes sense. In the scope of human evolution, language is a relatively recent invention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 344
This is why nonverbal communication has a far greater impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 359
The second consequence is that our body language expresses our mental state whether we like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 364
(remember, people can read your face in as little as seventeen milliseconds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 375
Thus, the first step in learning charisma‚Äîand what the first part of this book is all about‚Äîis developing the various mental states that produce charismatic body language and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 389
Individuals with strong internal skills are aware of what exactly is happening inside them and know how to handle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 399
‚ÄúTo know others is knowledge. To know oneself is wisdom.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 400
Knowing your internal world starts with one key insight upon which all charisma is built: your mind can‚Äôt tell fact from fiction. This is the one dimension of your internal world that can help you get into the right charismatic mental state at will, and almost instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 423
The placebo effect is the basis for many of the best charisma-enhancing techniques,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 436
When you exhibit presence, those around you feel listened to, respected, and valued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 438
exhibit presence, power, and warmth‚Äîyou must display charismatic body language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 440
by creating a charismatic internal state your body language will authentically display charisma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 441
critical. Get the internal state right, and the right charismatic behaviors and body language will pour forth automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 472
In fact, that‚Äôs probably exactly what will happen, because most of us tend to interpret events‚Äîwhether they‚Äôre personal or impersonal‚Äîas relating to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 475
When interacting with someone, assume that he or she will feel (at least on a subconscious level) that whatever you do relates to him or to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 482
Prevent Recognize Remedy or explain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 484
‚ÄúAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 492
(this means you can take deep belly breaths, not shallow chest breaths). How well you breathe affects how much oxygen gets to your brain, and therefore how well you perform mentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 524
For many of us, a state of doubt or uncertainty is an uncomfortable place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 526
Our inability to tolerate uncertainty carries multiple costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 529
Anxiety is a serious drawback to charisma. First, it impacts our internal state: quite obviously, it‚Äôs hard to be fully present while you‚Äôre feeling anxious. Anxiety can also lower our confidence. Anxiety, low presence, and low confidence can show up directly in our body language, as well as reduce our ability to emanate warmth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 531
Yet if there‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs certain, it‚Äôs that uncertainty isn‚Äôt going away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 533
Those who are better at handling it will gain a distinctive advantage over others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 537
But how many of us have felt our minds going over the different outcomes again and again, rehashing the various plans we‚Äôve made, replaying possible scenarios, mentally rehearsing the upcoming conversations not just once or twice but ad nauseam?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 547
The reason Tom couldn‚Äôt let go is that our minds are fundamentally uncomfortable with uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 548
The minute our brain registers ambiguity, it flashes an error signal. Uncertainty registers as a tension: something that must be corrected before we can feel comfortable again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 549
Our natural discomfort with uncertainty is yet another legacy of our survival instincts. We tend to be more comfortable with what is familiar, which obviously hasn‚Äôt killed us yet, than with what is unknown or uncertain, which could turn out to be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 552
the ability to be comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity turns out to be one of the strongest predictors of success in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 558
The single most effective technique I‚Äôve found to alleviate the discomfort of uncertainty is the responsibility transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 577
If you did feel something happen, fantastic: you‚Äôve just performed a responsibility transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 580
The reason this technique works is that when presented with a scenario, our brain‚Äôs first reaction is to consider it as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 585
may last only a brief moment, it‚Äôs enough to produce an emotional and physical reassurance,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 591
However, the responsibility transfer works without trying to negate uncertainty. Instead, it helps you to be less affected by it, drawing you out of the negative mental and physical states that often accompany a position of not knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 593
By presenting your mind with the possibility that responsibility has been transferred, you‚Äôre putting to good use the wonderful placebo effect‚Äîthe brain‚Äôs inability to distinguish between imagination and reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 603
Personally, I‚Äôve chosen to believe in a benevolent Universe, which has a grand master plan for me (and for everything else).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 605
perform a quick visualization to transfer responsibility. It‚Äôs amazing to feel the instant sense of relief and the warmth, calm, and serenity rising. I feel my whole body relax, and it‚Äôs as if my whole being starts to glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 607
Dissatisfaction Caused by Comparison&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 611
Human beings are by nature driven to compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 614
The very act of comparing and evaluating hinders our ability to be fully present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 616
And a negative evaluation can easily put us in a negative mental state, such as dissatisfaction, envy, or resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 623
Few things impact people‚Äôs performance more than how they feel about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 624
Athletes will tell you that a bad mental state will affect their performance no matter how well prepared they are physically. Psychological negativity can have real physical consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 625
When our internal voice starts criticizing us, lashing out, it can feel like we‚Äôre under attack. Because our brain doesn‚Äôt distinguish between imagination and reality, these internal attacks are perceived by our mind just as a real, physical attack would be, and they can generate an automatic physical reaction known as the threat response or fight-or-flight response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 628
The effects of this activation are well-known. Just as a zebra reacts to the stress of being chased by a lion, the human body shoots adrenaline and cortisol (stress hormones) through its veins, and directs all its resources toward crucial functions: elevated heart and breathing rates, muscle reaction, vision acuity, and so forth. The body is no longer concerned with living ten more years, but with surviving ten more minutes. It shuts down nonurgent functions such as muscle repair, digestion, and the immune system,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 633
In other words, because it‚Äôs not critical to survival, intelligent thinking gets shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Location: 633
David Rock, founder of the NeuroLeadership Institute, explains that ‚Äúthe threat response impairs analytic thinking, creative insight, and problem solving.‚Äù7 This kind of negativity doesn‚Äôt just affect our actual performance, it also affects how others perceive us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 639
No matter how brief that negative expression, the person facing you is going to spot it. And all they know is that while you were looking at them and listening to them, a negative expression crossed your face. Naturally they‚Äôll assume that expression was a reaction to them‚Äîwhat they said or did, or what you thought about them. This is how internal negativity affects your body language, and thus your charisma, in addition to your performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 642
Self-criticism is one of the most common obstacles to great performance in any field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 646
‚ÄúEighty percent of my day is spent fighting my inner critic.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 650
enough. In one of the manifestations of self-doubt, known as the impostor syndrome, competent people feel they don‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre doing and are just waiting for someone to expose them as a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 654
But already, just knowing the universality of such feelings can help us neutralize their effect and reduce their power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 668
The difficult feelings we experience are a natural by-product of one of our most useful survival mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 669
Feelings like fear or anxiety are designed to get you to do something. They‚Äôre uncomfortable because they‚Äôre ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù to be uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 706
Feeling internal discomfort and negativity is a natural part of life. Everyone experiences it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 713
we feel they ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt‚Äù be happening. So not only do we feel bad, we then also feel bad about feeling bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 735
The brain equates social needs with survival; being hungry and being ostracized activate similar neural responses.1 Somewhere in the back of our minds is the fear of being so disapproved-of that we‚Äôd be excluded by those who matter to our survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 740
that the tendency to feel bad about feeling bad is especially true for good people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 767
whatever I‚Äôve seen may well be the sign of how they‚Äôre feeling about themselves, an itchy wool suit, or something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 784
reality. But sometimes our mind will present us with a seriously distorted view of reality. And the distortion often skews negative because the elements that our danger-focused brain deems important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 785
are usually the most negative ones. This tendency is called the negativity bias, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 798
When your brain spins negative scenarios, remind yourself that you may not be getting an accurate perception of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 810
failure is seldom fatal, and just realizing that even the worst-case scenario is survivable can bolster your confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 830
thoughts. We want to avoid falling into the trap of arguing with them or trying to suppress them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 837
Because trying to suppress a self-critical thought only makes it more central to your thinking, it‚Äôs a far better strategy to simply aim to neutralize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 850
Once the fight-or-flight response is aroused, it‚Äôs hard to quiet down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 852
If you aimed to simply suppress the anger, you would pay a high price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 854
But what if you happened to learn that this apparently reckless driver was actually a distraught mother whose baby was choking in the backseat, and she was desperately trying to pull over into the breakdown lane while reaching back to save her baby‚Äôs life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 857
Deciding to change your belief about what happened (technically called cognitive reappraisal) effectively decreases the brain‚Äôs stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 859
The researchers concluded that deciding to change beliefs was a far more effective and healthier solution than attempting to repress or ignore emotions.4 In most situations, we don‚Äôt know for certain what motivates a person‚Äôs actions, so we might as well choose the explanation that is most helpful to us and create a version of events that gets us into the specific mental state we need for charisma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 863
first, choosing to rewrite your perception of reality is actually the rational and smart thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 864
It can help you get back into the right mental state to emanate charismatic body language and can improve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 875
What if this unfortunate, unpleasant experience is absolutely perfect just as it is‚Äîthe insomnia, the nausea, the fact that this is happening the very night before a high-profile assignment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 876
In what way can this turn out to be absolutely perfect for me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 890
‚ÄúI decide to interpret everything favorably toward myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 890
It‚Äôs not just that I‚Äôm optimistic, I‚Äôm actually conveniently deluded.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 891
Once again, we can thank the brain‚Äôs tendency to accept imagination as reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 894
rather than trying to suppress or ignore your internal difficulties, consider a few alternate versions of reality. Conjure a few different scenarios that would induce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 904
Was this pleasant? Definitely not. Effective? Absolutely. Within one month, I was able to&lt;/p&gt;

Being comfortable with discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 996
The answer, surprisingly, is to delve into those very sensations of discomfort. That‚Äôs right. Though it sounds counterintuitive, rather than trying to suppress, ignore, or power through them, your goal is to give your full attention to the very sensations you‚Äôd instinctively want to push away.&lt;/p&gt;

If their internal emotions were not what they wanted the outside world to see, sooner or later, something of these underlying thoughts and feelings would show.&lt;/p&gt;

Because of its powerful mental and physiological effects, visualization is one of the most effective charisma-boosting tools available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,108
Just by using the right mental images, your subconscious mind will send a remarkable chain reaction of confidence signals cascading through your body. In fact, you can display nearly any body language just by picking the right visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,123
The next time you do this exercise, aim to create images that are even more detailed. Guided imagery must be precise, vivid, and detailed to be effective, says Harvard-trained visualization specialist Stephen Krauss. When visualization is used with Olympic ski teams, skiers visualize themselves careening through the entire course, feeling their muscles tensing, experiencing each bump and turn in their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,151
Visualization is truly a miracle method, helping you boost confidence, emanate more warmth, replace anxiety with calm serenity, or gain access to whichever emotion you‚Äôd like to feel and then broadcast it through your body language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,175
I‚Äôve even found visualization helpful before writing important e-mails. Just as the right visualization helps you get into the right body language so that the right signals flow effortlessly, you can use visualization to get into specific emotional or mental states so that the right words flow as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Gratitude is a great antidote to all of these negative feelings because it comes from thinking of things you already have‚Äîfrom material items or experiences to cherished relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

Gratitude can be a great charisma conduit, bringing you back to the present and giving you immediate access to feelings of both confidence and warmth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,222
gratitude helps you live longer, healthier, and even happier.&lt;/p&gt;

During a recent lunch meeting at a restaurant, for instance, I focused on little delights: the sun streaming through the window; blue skies; that the waiter got my order right; or the existence, availability, and wonders of ketchup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,297
When our only aim is to broadcast goodwill, it takes the pressure off. We‚Äôre no longer striving, struggling, pushing for things to go in a certain direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,298
And since we‚Äôre less concerned about how the interaction goes, we can both feel and project more charismatic confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,303
One simple but effective way to start is to try to find three things you like about the person you want to feel goodwill toward.&lt;/p&gt;

As you can imagine, this cold internal message resonated in her head, played across her body language, and diminished how much warmth she could emanate.&lt;/p&gt;

Self-confidence is our belief in our ability to do or to learn how to do something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,367
Self-esteem is how much we approve of or value ourselves. It‚Äôs often a comparison-based evaluation (whether measured against other people or against our own internal standards for approval).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,369
Self-compassion is how much warmth we can have for ourselves, especially when we‚Äôre going through a difficult experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,373
may be healthier to focus on self-compassion than on self-esteem.6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,374
Self-esteem is more of a roller coaster, contingent on how we believe we compare to others. It also tends to correlate with narcissism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,375
Individuals who score high on self-compassion scales demonstrate greater emotional resilience to daily difficulties and fewer negative reactions to difficult situations, such as receiving unflattering feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,377
Higher self-compassion predicts a greater sense of personal responsibility for the outcome of events: it helps predict levels of accountability. People who score high on self-compassion also have a lower tendency for denial. This makes sense: personal mistakes would generate less self-criticism, so people would be more willing to admit to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,383
self-compassion is feeling that what happened to you is unfortunate, whereas self-pity is feeling that what happened to you is unfair. In this way, self-pity can lead to resentment or bitterness, and to feeling more isolated and alienated. In contrast, self-compassion often leads to increased feelings of connectedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,394
Self-compassion delivers an impressive array of benefits: decreased anxiety, depression, and self-criticism; improved relationships and greater feelings of¬†social connectedness and satisfaction with life; increased ability&lt;/p&gt;

I was walking up the Gran Via in Madrid, feeling tired, hungry, lonely, unfashionably dressed, and the epitome of an ugly American. The attitude was definitely not working for me, so what to do? I decided that I was a movie star incognito. I stood up straighter, shoulders back, head erect, with the posture that I imagine I would have if I were royalty. Suddenly the dress that had seemed so out of place a moment ago felt like an amazing fashion statement, something that everyone else should copy. I noticed as I walked down the street that heads were turning, all of them. When I asked a man for directions, he said he would be honored if I would allow him to show me the way. It was amazing. From one second to the next, I went from a dowdy, frumpy, ugly stranger to a head-turning movie star. It was memorable. And enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;

Throughout this chapter we‚Äôll look at four distinct kinds of charisma: focus, visionary, kindness, and authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,304
Within organizations, leaders‚Äô emotions always propagate fastest because people are strongly affected by those in a position of power&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,318
This tendency to mimic the body language of others is technically called limbic resonance,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,319
thanks to a certain class of neurons called oscillators, which coordinate people physically by regulating how and when their bodies move together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,323
Imitating someone‚Äôs body language is an easy way to establish trust and rapport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,324
is the conscious application of something that many charismatic people do instinctively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,325
consciously mirror someone‚Äôs body language, you activate deep instincts of trust and liking. For this reason, it can be a great aid when you need people to open up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,328
mirroring someone‚Äôs body language can get them to pick up your dropped items, buy your products, or give you a better deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,330
During your next few conversations, try to mirror the other person‚Äôs overall posture: the way they hold their head, how they place their feet, the shifts in their weight. If they move their left hand, move your right hand. Aim also to adapt your voice to theirs in speed, pitch, and intonation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,375
Only when it‚Äôs your turn to speak should you start infusing the interaction with warmth, caring, and compassion through your voice, face, and eyes. As you speak, gradually shift into a more relaxed, calm, and, eventually, confident posture. There‚Äôs a good chance that she‚Äôll follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,377
Mirror-then-lead is a smart strategy when the person you‚Äôre interacting with needs reassurance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,383
Rather than mirroring, try breaking him out of his posture by handing him something: a piece of paper or a pen‚Äîwhatever works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,384
And then, as soon as he‚Äôs in a new position, distract him by giving him new information or changing the subject while you mirror his posture to reestablish rapport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,385
Remember, our physiology affects our psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,387
As long as their body is in a certain emotional mode, it will be nearly impossible to get their mind to feel something different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,425
And by association, their discomfort would likely affect their perception of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,432
someone, it can speed up their heart rate and send a hormone called phenylethylamine, or PEA, coursing through their bloodstream. PEA is the same hormone that produces the phenomenon we call love at first sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,437
Our eyes are a key part of our nonverbal communication, perhaps the single most important one. Why are eyes called the ‚Äúwindows to the soul‚Äù? Because they are the most mobile part of the entire face‚Äîand so, the most expressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,443
to keep eye contact for three full seconds at the end of your&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,542
Assuming a strong, confident physical posture will make you feel more confident and more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,552
Empathy: wanting to ensure that the other person feels heard and understood and knows you‚Äôre paying attention Insecurity: wanting to please or appease the person you‚Äôre interacting with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,554
people who come across as powerful, confident, or high-status are usually more contained; they don‚Äôt feel the urge to give so much reassurance because they‚Äôre not as worried about what their counterpart is thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,558
The first is excessive or rapid nodding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,560
The second hindrance is excessive verbal reassurance: making a sound, such as ‚Äúuh-huh,‚Äù or a half-sentence, such as ‚ÄúOh, I agree.‚Äù Done once, and consciously, this is fine; multiple times per sentence is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,598
While our words speak to a person‚Äôs logical mind, our nonverbal communication speaks to a person‚Äôs emotional mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,601
When verbal and nonverbal messages contradict, we tend to trust what we see in the other person‚Äôs body language more than what we hear them say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,635
‚Äúright‚Äù charisma style depends on your personality, the situation, your goals, and the person you‚Äôre dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,655
‚ÄúI did something nice for this person, so I must like him. I wouldn‚Äôt have agreed to do a favor for someone I dislike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,663
Remember, it‚Äôll make them rationalize their actions in your favor. ‚ÄúWow, I really did go all-out for this person. I must really like them.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,667
‚ÄúWe all crave honest appreciation. It‚Äôs a gnawing and unfaltering human hunger; and the rare individual who satisfies it will hold people in the palm of his hand.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,681
Remember John Kenneth Galbraith‚Äôs quote about our strong preference to prove ourselves correct rather than change our minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,685
If someone feels like they‚Äôve done you harm, they will seek to rationalize their actions and will convince themselves that what they did was justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,692
show the person how this idea or project was, at its very core, in its very source, inspired by what they did in the past‚Äîa similar idea, project, or initiative they supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,701
In brief, hostile feelings are apt to harm your health unless you know how to handle them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,748
difference between receiving tough news on a day when I was operating well and on a day when I was sick or tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,824
Once they are reassured of their own worth, people will accept your comments far more easily, and they‚Äôll get less defensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,835
That takes who was right or wrong off the table and focuses instead on something you can both agree on without anyone having to win or lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,841
Franklin came to realize that the short-lived pleasure of being right was not worth the long-term negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,845
It means that others look forward to being with you because they like themselves better as a result of being around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,847
You can tell someone that you think they‚Äôre wrong with a look, intonation, or gesture just as eloquently as you can in words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,866
Having a disagreement or a conflict can actually improve a relationship and be a great thing in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,868
Once you get through a difficult situation and it was well handled, you know that the relationship can withstand difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,877
Forgiving yourself and getting into a good mental state also helps you avoid appearing overly apologetic, subservient, or insecure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,899
‚ÄúHelp me understand how you see things‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,918
think of the timing, the setting, and the situation the person may be in.&lt;/p&gt;

Prince: perfection is not when there is no more to add, but when there is no more to subtract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,995
Each one of your supporting points should open with entertaining anecdotes, fascinating facts, compelling statistics, great metaphors, examples, and analogies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,041
Seinfeld finally got his first chance at the big time‚Äîa six-minute spot on The Tonight Show‚Äîhe practiced those six minutes for six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,046
When a speech is important I practice until every breath is perfect, because knowing I‚Äôve got the speech so well mastered allows me to be spontaneous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,052
Be strategic: make sure you‚Äôre getting value out of each nonverbal gesture you make, and limit superfluous gestures to avoid wasting any bit of your audience‚Äôs attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,064
Charismatic speakers know how to give the impression that they‚Äôre as comfortable walking across the stage as they would be walking across their living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,065
This is called owning the stage,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,080
To make your audience feel particularly special, speak as if you were sharing a secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,092
Pause, Breathe, and Slow Down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,103
Pause. Breathe. Slow Down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,112
It‚Äôs called a dramatic pause for a reason: it adds drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,130
voice fluctuation, strategic pauses, and intonation drops to make your message compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,139
instance, that business moguls and entertainers make mistakes purposefully to make themselves more relatable to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,152
Thanks to your brain‚Äôs inability to distinguish imagination from reality, your body will be filled with the same cocktail of chemicals (yes, we‚Äôre helping you play chemist with your brain) as it was during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,162
successful speech is simple: make it about them, not about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,163
If, instead, you can make it all about your audience‚Äîwondering how they‚Äôre doing‚Äîyou take the focus off yourself, lift your self-consciousness, and get into a state of goodwill, which will be read and appreciated by the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,177
one main, simple, crystal-clear message,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,178
Support each point with an entertaining story, interesting statistic, concrete example, or vivid metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,182
Use a wide, well-balanced stance and take up as much space as possible on stage. Limit superfluous gestures that distract the audience‚Äôs attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,183
Speak as if you‚Äôre sharing a secret with the audience, telling them something special&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,185
Use smiles and fluctuation to warm your voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,186
Pause frequently and deliberately to show confidence and add drama as well as give yourself a chance to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,199
circumstances. As you know, anxiety impacts how you feel, how you perform, and how others perceive you and react to you. It‚Äôs often immediately visible in your body language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,213
Second, express high expectations. Sometimes, simply assigning to people the labels you want them to live up to is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,217
‚Äúexpressing high performance expectations‚Äù of people while ‚Äúcommunicating a high degree of confidence‚Äù in their ability to meet those expectations was the hallmark of charismatic leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,221
Third, articulate a vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,248
in times of crisis, people instinctively turn to individuals who are bold, confident, and decisive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,249
Crisis creates uncertainty, which creates angst, and people will cling to whatever they feel diminishes this angst. This is why faith, vision, and authority have such power in times of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,253
Express high expectations of people, and communicate your complete confidence in their ability to rise to the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,255
Articulate a bold vision, show your confidence in your ability to realize that vision, and act decisively to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,264
You Become a Magnet for Praise as Well as Envy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,286
I told Nancy that the only way her success wouldn‚Äôt make him feel envious or resentful was if he could see it as his success, too. I encouraged her to give Kevin this sense of ownership by finding some way he might have participated in her success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,293
I also reminded Nancy of the Ben Franklin Effect. She could periodically ask Kevin for his thoughts and opinions to show him that she values his opinion, helping him to feel respected again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,304
Second, expressing something we don‚Äôt believe leads to cognitive dissonance, which uses up our focus, diverts our attention, and thus impairs our performance. Insincerity just isn‚Äôt worth the toll it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,415
to your vulnerabilities would ultimately enhance your power may seem counterintuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,473
It‚Äôs just that when I combine logical arguments with emotion, passion, and charisma, it suddenly just feels right for everyone to do what I say.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,476
I second-guess my decisions now much more than I used to.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,514
He came across as shy, awkward, and hesitant‚Äîthe very opposite of a confident and charismatic leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,526
He could fluctuate his voice with warmth and power and he spoke with a richer, more resonant tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,527
Within just a few weeks of our working together, James had achieved an astounding transformation. His peers watched in awe and his superiors in amazement as their colleague‚Äôs performance rating soared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,528
As one of them told me later, it was ‚Äúa complete metamorphosis.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,531
‚ÄúThese practices have now become second nature.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,538
Remember, it‚Äôs really a question of accessing different parts of you, learning to more fully express qualities that you already have. We all have the capacity for presence, power, and warmth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 3,964
Say it with authority, with anger, with sorrow, with empathetic care and concern, with warmth, and with enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;

The Power of Moments: Why Certain Experiences Have Extraordinary Impact
Chip Heath and Dan Heath
Last accessed on Tuesday January 22, 2019
177 Highlight(s) | 5 Note(s)
Yellow highlight | Location: 234
Moments matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 235
All it takes is a bit of insight and fore-thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 252
To avoid this kind of oversight, we must understand when special moments are needed. We must learn to think in moments, to spot the occasions that are worthy of investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 254
This ‚Äúmoment-spotting‚Äù habit can be unnatural. In organizations, for instance, we are consumed with goals. Time is meaningful only insofar as it clarifies or measures our goals. The goal is the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 255
But for an individual human being, moments are the thing. Moments are what we remember and what we cherish. Certainly we might celebrate achieving a goal, such as completing a marathon or landing a significant client‚Äîbut the achievement is embedded in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 261
We‚Äôll explore three situations that deserve punctuation: transitions, milestones, and pits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Location: 265
crisp up an otherwise gradual evolution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 269
That logic shows why the first day of work is an experience worth investing in. For new employees, it‚Äôs three big transitions at once: intellectual (new work), social (new people), and environmental (new place).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 342
So ‚Äúfresh starts‚Äù happen not only on New Year‚Äôs Day, but also on any other landmark date. If you‚Äôre struggling to make a transition, create a defining moment that draws a dividing line between Old You and New You.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 435
The little girl asked, ‚ÄúCan we come back tomorrow?‚Äù Dietz began to weep. He had transformed terror into delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 443
since the scans go faster, the hospitals can complete more in a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 445
For patients, a moment of agony was transformed into a moment of elevation. Dietz flipped a pit into a peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 447
Transitions should be marked, milestones commemorated, and pits filled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 451
The point we‚Äôre emphasizing here is that certain circumstances demand attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 537
Times to be savored. Moments that make us feel engaged, joyful, amazed, motivated. They are peaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 556
The book was his ‚Äúattempt to trace the defects of society back to the defects of human nature.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 658
‚ÄúStudies have consistently shown that reliability, dependability, and competence meet customer expectations,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 661
Most service executives are ignoring the research about meeting versus exceeding expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 685
In other words, the happiest people in any industry tend to spend more, so moving a 4 to a 7 generates more additional spending than moving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 689
If you Elevate the Positives (Plan B), you‚Äôll earn about 9 times more revenue than if you Eliminate the Negatives (Plan A).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 693
Research has shown, again and again, that we tend to obsess about problems and negative information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 698
‚ÄúBad Is Stronger than Good.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 698
So, when it comes to the way service executives think, it‚Äôs not surprising that bad is stronger than good. Their attention is naturally drawn to the customers who had the worst experiences. But in indulging that instinct, they miss an enormous opportunity. To be clear,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 705
How do you build peaks? You create a positive moment with elements of elevation, insight, pride, and/or connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 707
To elevate a moment, do three things: First, boost sensory appeal. Second, raise the stakes. Third, break the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 741
Why? It‚Äôs no one‚Äôs job, and it‚Äôs a hassle, and there‚Äôs always something happening that seems more urgent. This same dynamic is what makes it so hard to create peaks in our personal lives as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 749
We‚Äôre not trying to pop your balloon. Rather, we want to build your determination: It‚Äôs going to be way harder than you think to create peaks. But once you‚Äôve done it, you‚Äôre going to consider every ounce of effort worth it. You will have created your own defining moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 790
We may have more time to live than he did, but should that be a reason to put them off?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 829
Breaking the script‚Äîdefying people‚Äôs expectations of how an experience will unfold‚Äîis the third method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,000
Novelty even changes our perception of time. In an experiment conducted by Vani Pariyadath and David Eagleman of Baylor College of Medicine, participants were shown a series of images. Most of them were identical, but every now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,004
This misperception has become known as the ‚Äúoddball effect.‚Äù12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,011
In other words, surprise stretches time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,013
Afterward, they are asked to estimate how long the fall took, and their estimates are, on average, too high by 36%. Their fear and focus make time seem to expand. (So here‚Äôs one tip to live a ‚Äúlonger‚Äù life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,024
By breaking the script, we can lay down a richer set of memories. As the authors of the book Surprise put it, ‚ÄúWe feel most comfortable when things are certain, but we feel most alive when they‚Äôre not.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,044
‚Ä¢ Novelty actually seems to slow down time. That‚Äôs why we feel like time goes faster as we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,197
When you have a sudden realization, one that you didn‚Äôt see coming, and one that you know viscerally is right, you‚Äôve tripped over the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,224
CLTS facilitators see the problem vividly, but they don‚Äôt share their concerns directly. They let the villagers see for themselves. The ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment should always happen in the minds of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,226
This three-part recipe‚Äîa (1) clear insight (2) compressed in time and (3) discovered by the audience itself‚Äîprovides a blueprint for us when we want people to confront uncomfortable truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,230
To trip is to catch one‚Äôs foot on something and stumble. To trip over the truth is to catch one‚Äôs brain on something and struggle. What exactly is the ‚Äúsomething&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,234
Your focus, in other words, would be on the virtues of the solution. But in the stories we‚Äôve seen so far in this chapter, you‚Äôll notice that no one is talking about solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,237
What they did, instead, was dramatize the problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,239
You can‚Äôt appreciate the solution until you appreciate the problem. So when we talk about ‚Äútripping over the truth,‚Äù we mean the truth about a problem or harm. That‚Äôs what sparks sudden insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,246
Over the course of the week at Palmer‚Äôs CDI, the professors learn the science of teaching: how to motivate students, how to reach different types of learners, and how to ensure that students retain the most important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,249
‚Äúbackward-integrated design.‚Äù First, you identify your goals. Second, you figure out how you‚Äôd assess whether students had hit those goals. Third, you design activities that would prepare students to excel at those assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,259
Now put yourself in Palmer‚Äôs shoes. He knows professors are approaching curriculum design the wrong way, and he has a solution for them (backward-integrated design). If he pitched the virtues of the solution, that would make him, in essence, a salesman for backward-integrated design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,261
But how do audiences respond to sales pitches? With skepticism. We quibble and challenge and question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,262
If Palmer wants to persuade the professors, he needs them to trip over the truth. And that starts with a focus on the problem, not the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

More than thirty years later, Michael Dinneen looks back on that night as one of the defining moments of his life. It was the first time he had lost a patient.6 But what sticks with him nearly as much is what the night taught him about himself: I can endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,396
Others, like Dinneen, discover that they can survive the experiences, and that the potential negative peaks are outweighed by the positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,397
Dinneen never would have learned about his ability to endure had he not been pushed and supported by Ridenour. ‚ÄúI was expected to get back in the game,‚Äù said Dinneen. ‚ÄúHe knew I had it in me to make it through that night when I didn‚Äôt know that myself.‚Äù Ridenour‚Äôs wise actions in the middle of the night transformed a moment of trauma into a moment of growth.&lt;/p&gt;

good starting place is a two-part formula cited in a paper by the psychologist David Scott Yeager and eight colleagues: high standards + assurance.8 Yeager described a study in a suburban junior high school in which 44 seventh-grade students were assigned to write an essay about a personal hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,517
‚ÄúIf we had nothing to tell him, he‚Äôd be disappointed,‚Äù Blakely said. ‚ÄúThe logic seems counterintuitive, but it worked beautifully. He knew that many people become paralyzed by the fear of failure. They‚Äôre constantly afraid of what others will think if they don‚Äôt do a great job and, as a result, take no risks. My father wanted us to try everything and feel free to push the envelope. His attitude taught me to define failure as not trying something I want to do instead of not achieving the right outcome.‚Äù His question, ‚ÄúWhat did you guys fail at this week?‚Äù was a push to stretch. It was an attempt to normalize failure, to make it part of a casual dinner conversation. Because when you seek out situations where you might fail, failure loses some of its menace. You‚Äôve been inoculated against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,531
The promise of stretching is not success, it‚Äôs learning. It‚Äôs self-insight. It‚Äôs the promise of gleaning the answers to some of the most important and vexing questions of our lives: What do we want? What can we do? Who can we be? What can we endure?&lt;/p&gt;

About a month later, Risinger kicked off a sales meeting with the story of Hughes‚Äôs progress with Dr.¬†Singh, highlighting the value of asking more questions and listening to the answers.

The style is not important. What‚Äôs important is authenticity: being personal not programmatic. And frequency: closer to weekly than yearly. And of course what‚Äôs most important is the message: ‚ÄúI saw what you did and I appreciate it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

The common goal to ‚Äúget in shape‚Äù is ambiguous and un-motivating. Pursuing it puts you on a path with no clear destination and no intermediate moments to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;

By using Kamb‚Äôs level-up strategy, we multiply the number of motivating milestones we encounter en route to a goal. That‚Äôs a forward-looking strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,890
We‚Äôre anticipating moments of pride ahead. But the opposite is also possible: to surface those milestones you‚Äôve already met but might not have noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,921
A numerical goal plus supporting plans. Notice what that combination leaves us with: A destination that is not inherently motivating and that lacks meaningful milestones along the way. As a result, achieving the ‚Äú20 by 2020‚Äù goal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,925
We should be careful that we don‚Äôt let this corporate style of goal-setting infiltrate our personal lives, where we‚Äôre in full control. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to lose 10 pounds in 2 months,‚Äù for instance, is a classic corporate goal: arbitrary, numerical, and lacking intermediate milestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,928
By now, you know what to do: Restore the milestones. Level up: Go one week straight without using the elevator. Pick out 2 microbrews to enjoy on Saturday after a full week without booze. If I jog continuously for three songs on my playlist, that entitles me to download three new ones. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

The same logic applies to milestones involving less tangible goals, such as building leadership&lt;/p&gt;

skills. In most organizations, the only clear ‚Äúlevels‚Äù en route to leadership positions are promotions. But what if it takes five years for an employee to earn a promotion, or what if she is not interested in or suited for a promotion? How do you create the intermediate milestones that could provide moments of pride?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,958
Hitting a milestone sparks pride. It should also spark a celebration‚Äîa moment of elevation. (Don‚Äôt forget that milestones, along with pits and transitions, are three natural defining moments that deserve extra attention.) Milestones deserve peaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,001
‚ÄúFrom my experience, the most common trait you will consistently observe in accomplished people is an obsession with completion.6 Once a project falls into their horizon, they crave almost compulsively, to finish it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,004
What milestones do is compel us to make that push, because (a) they‚Äôre within our grasp, and (b) we‚Äôve chosen them precisely because they‚Äôre worth reaching for. Milestones define moments that are conquerable and worth conquering. A Boy Scout spends one more&lt;/p&gt;

Rather, they are describing moments of courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,079
The military understands this concept well. As the psychologist S. J. Rachman wrote in a report on military training, ‚ÄúWhat might be called ‚Äòtraining for courage‚Äô plays an important part in preparing people to undertake dangerous jobs such as fire-fighting or parachuting.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,091
That element‚Äî‚Äúgradual and graduated practice‚Äù‚Äîis also the hallmark of exposure therapy, one of the most effective techniques for reducing phobias (irrational fears).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,113
Managing fear‚Äîthe goal of exposure therapy‚Äîis a critical part of courage. The civil rights demonstrator and the bomb-disposal operator must be able to control their fears to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,114
But courage isn‚Äôt just suppressed fear. It‚Äôs also the knowledge of how to act in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

His workshops weren‚Äôt just about toughening up emotionally. They were about mental rehearsals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,117
Participants had to anticipate how they would react to certain situations. In a sense, they were preloading a response so that, in the moment, they could act quickly without deliberation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,119
The psychologist Peter Gollwitzer has studied the way this preloading affects our behavior. His research shows that when people make advance mental commitments‚Äîif X happens, then I will do Y‚Äîthey are substantially more likely to act in support of their goals than people who lack those mental plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,123
Gollwitzer calls these plans ‚Äúimplementation intentions,‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,124
and often the trigger for the plan is as simple as a time and place: When I leave work today, I‚Äôm going to drive straight to the gym. The success rate is striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,125
Setting implementation intentions more than doubled the number of students who turned in a certain assignment on time; doubled the number of women who performed breast self-exams in a certain month; and cut by half the recovery time required by patients who had received hip or knee replacement (among many other examples). There is power in preloading a response.&lt;/p&gt;

In groups, we are constantly assessing the reactions and feelings of the group. Our words and&lt;/p&gt;

glances are a kind of social sonar. Are you still there? Are you hearing what I‚Äôm hearing? Are your reactions like mine? Laughing in groups is another way of sending positive signals back and forth. We are synchronizing our reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose is defined as the sense that you are contributing to others, that your work has broader meaning. Passion is the feeling of excitement or enthusiasm you have about your work.&lt;/p&gt;

Our relationships are stronger when we perceive that our partners are responsive to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,644
Responsiveness encompasses three things: Understanding: My partner knows how I see myself and what is important to me. Validation: My partner respects who I am and what I want. Caring: My partner takes active and supportive steps in helping me meet my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

To be principled means to consistently operate with principles that can be clearly explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 109
I learned my principles over a lifetime of making a lot of mistakes and spending a lot of time reflecting on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 124
My painful mistakes shifted me from having a perspective of ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm right‚Äù to having one of ‚ÄúHow do I know I‚Äôm right?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

Experience taught me how invaluable it is to reflect on and write down my decision-making criteria whenever I made a decision, so I got in the habit of doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

We are all born with different thinking abilities but we aren‚Äôt born with decision-making skills. We learn them from our encounters with reality.&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúIf a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

And most people tend to be biased by their recent experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúYou better make sense of what happened to other people in other times and other places because if you don‚Äôt you won‚Äôt know if these things can happen to you and, if they do, you won‚Äôt know how to deal with them.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 37
Successful people change in ways that allow them to continue to take advantage of their strengths while compensating for their weaknesses and unsuccessful people don‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;

I have come to realize that bad times coupled with good reflections provide some of the best lessons,&lt;/p&gt;

didn‚Äôt value experience as much as character, creativity, and common sense, which I suppose was related to my having started Bridgewater two years out of school myself, and my belief that having an ability to figure things out is more important than having specific knowledge of how to do something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 78
also learned how people can control how their brains work to produce dramatically better effects. These insights helped me to deal with people more effectively,&lt;/p&gt;

The 2008 debt crisis was another one of those like the one in 1982, which were both like many more before them and many more that will come. I enjoyed reflecting back on my painful mistakes and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 87
a result, I tended to hire people who were the same way‚Äîwho would dive right into challenges, figure out what to do about them, and then do it. I figured that if they had great character, common sense, and creativity, and were driven to achieve our shared mission, they would discover what it took to be successful if I gave them the freedom to figure out how to make the right decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 87
But starting in the 1990s, I began to recognize the emotional barriers most people had to looking at their problems and weaknesses forthrightly. Rather than embracing ambiguous situations and difficult challenges, they tended to get uncomfortable when facing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 87
But while almost all of us quickly agreed on the principles intellectually, many still struggled to convert what they had agreed to intellectually into effective action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 87
This was because their habits and emotional barriers remained stronger than their reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 91
It seems to me that life consists of three phases. In the first, we are dependent on others and we learn. In the second, others depend on us and we work. And in the third and last, when others no longer depend on us and we no longer have to work, we are free to savor life. I was beginning my transition from my second to my third phase. Both intellectually and emotionally, I was no longer as excited about being successful as I was excited about having the people I cared about be successful without me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 95
because their need to achieve what they envision is stronger than the pain they experience as they struggle to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

When I asked him about his background in rocketry, he told me he didn‚Äôt have one. ‚ÄúI just started reading books,‚Äù he said. That‚Äôs how shapers think and act.&lt;/p&gt;

I gave Wang a copy of Joseph Campbell‚Äôs great book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, because he is a classic hero and I thought it might help him. I also gave him The Lessons of History, a 104-page distillation of the major forces through history by Will and Ariel Durant, and River Out of Eden by the insightful Richard Dawkins, which explains how evolution works. He gave me Georgi Plekhanov‚Äôs classic On the Role of the Individual in History. All these books showed how the same things happened over and over again throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;

What I have seen is that the happiest people discover their own nature and match their life to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 124
I realized that passing on knowledge is like passing on DNA‚Äîit is more important than the individual, because it lives way beyond the individual‚Äôs life. This is my attempt to help you succeed by passing along to you what I learned about how to struggle well‚Äîor, at the very least, to help you get the most out of each unit of effort you put in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 134
My point is that people who create great things aren‚Äôt idle dreamers: They are totally grounded in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 134
don‚Äôt. Some people want to change the world and others want to operate in simple harmony with it and savor life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 135
Over time I learned that getting more out of life wasn‚Äôt just a matter of working harder at it. It was much more a matter of working effectively, because working effectively could increase my capacity by hundreds of times. I don‚Äôt care what you want or how hard you want to work for it. That‚Äôs for you to decide. I‚Äôm just trying to pass along to you what has helped me get the most out of each hour of time and each unit of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 138
This takes practice and changing one‚Äôs habits. I have found that it typically takes about eighteen months, which is how long it takes to change most habits.&lt;/p&gt;

now realize that nature optimizes for the whole, not for the individual, but most people judge good and bad based only on how it affects them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 147
But we do know that what we call mankind was simply the result of DNA evolving into a new form about two hundred thousand years ago,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 147
years ago, and we know that mankind will certainly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 152
you can develop a reflexive reaction to psychic pain that causes you to reflect on it rather than avoid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 153
Most people have a tough time reflecting when they are in pain and they pay attention to other things when the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 153
pain passes, so they miss out on the reflections that provide the lessons. If you can reflect well while you‚Äôre in pain (which is probably too much to ask), great. But if you can remember to reflect after it passes, that‚Äôs valuable too. (I created a Pain Button app to help people do this, which I describe in the appendix.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 153
As you climb above the blizzard of things that surrounds you, you will realize that they seem bigger than they really are when you are seeing them up close; that most things in life are just ‚Äúanother one of those.‚Äù The higher you ascend, the more effective you become at working with reality to shape outcomes toward your goals. What once seemed impossibly complex becomes simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 154
that you will become hooked on: ‚Ä¢¬†Identifying, accepting, and learning how to deal with your weaknesses, ‚Ä¢¬†Preferring that the people around you be honest with you rather than keep their negative thoughts about you to themselves, and ‚Ä¢¬†Being yourself rather than having to pretend to be strong where you are weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 154
Our upbringings and our experiences in the world have conditioned us to be embarrassed by our weaknesses and hide them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Page: 155
Weigh second- and third-order consequences. By recognizing the higher-level&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Page: 156
For example, the first-order consequences of exercise (pain and time spent) are commonly considered undesirable, while the second-order consequences (better health and more attractive appearance) are desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Page: 156
By contrast, people who choose what they really want, and avoid the temptations and get over the pains that drive them away from what they&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink highlight | Page: 156
really want, are much more likely to have successful lives.&lt;/p&gt;

that it is much more important that you are a good designer/manager of your life than a good worker in it, you will be on the right path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue highlight | Page: 160
Watching people struggle and having others watch you struggle can elicit all kinds of ego-driven emotions such as sympathy, pity, embarrassment, anger, or defensiveness. You need to get over all that and stop seeing struggling as something negative. Most of life‚Äôs greatest opportunities come out of moments of struggle; it‚Äôs up to you to make the most of these tests of creativity and character.&lt;/p&gt;

To be effective you must not let your need to be right be more important than your need to find out what‚Äôs true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 185
In addition to your ego barrier, you (and everyone else) also have blind spots‚Äîareas where your way of thinking prevents you from seeing things accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 186
If you‚Äôre like most people, you have no clue how other people see things and aren‚Äôt good at seeking to understand what they are thinking, because you‚Äôre too preoccupied with telling them what you yourself think is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 186
In other words, you are closed-minded; you presume too much. This closed-mindedness is terribly costly; it causes you to miss out on all sorts of wonderful possibilities and dangerous threats that other people might be showing you‚Äîand it blocks criticism that could be constructive and even lifesaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 187
Differences in thinking can be symbiotic and complementary instead of disruptive. For example, the lateral approach to thinking common among creative people can lead them to be unreliable, while more linear thinkers are often more dependable; some people are more emotional while others are more logical, and so on. None of these individuals would be able to succeed at any kind of complex project without the help of others who have complementary strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 187
In my opinion, these two barriers‚Äîego and blind spots‚Äîare the fatal flaws that keep intelligent, hardworking people from living up to their potential.&lt;/p&gt;

Once I understood that it‚Äôs all physiological, many things became clearer to me. While I used to get angry and frustrated at people because of the choices they made, I came to realize that they weren‚Äôt intentionally acting in a way that seemed counterproductive; they were just living out things as they saw them, based on how their brains worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 210
The only sensible way of behaving with each other was to look down upon ourselves with mutual understanding so we could make objective sense of things. Not only did this make our disagreements less frustrating, it also allowed us to maximize our effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 210
All these pieces come together to determine what each person is like, and if you know what a person is like, you‚Äôll have a pretty good idea of what you can expect from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 210
Most attributes are a double-edged sword that bring potential benefits and potential harm. The more extreme the attribute, the more extreme the potential good or bad outcomes it is likely to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 210
For example, a highly creative, goal-oriented person good at imagining new ideas might undervalue the minutiae of daily life, which is also important; he might be so driven in his pursuit of long-term goals that he might have disdain for people who focus on the details of daily life. Similarly, a task-oriented person who is great with details might undervalue creativity‚Äîand worse still, may squelch it in the interests of efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

that prayer and meditation seemed to have similar effects on the brain in producing feelings of spirituality (the rising above oneself to feel a greater connection to the whole) but that each religion adds its own different superstitions on top of that common feeling of spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;

When thoughts and instructions come to me from my subconscious, rather than acting on them immediately, I have gotten into the habit of examining them with my conscious, logical mind.&lt;/p&gt;

The biggest difference between people who guide their own personal evolution and achieve their goals and those who don‚Äôt is that those who make progress reflect on what causes their amygdala hijackings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 221
If you do just about anything frequently enough over time, you will form a habit that will control you. Good habits are those that get you to do what your ‚Äúupper-level you‚Äù wants, and bad habits are those that are controlled by your ‚Äúlower-level you‚Äù and stand in the way of your getting what your ‚Äúupper-level you‚Äù wants. You can create a better set of habits if you understand how this part of your brain works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 221
Research suggests that if you stick with a behavior for approximately eighteen months, you will build a strong tendency to stick to it nearly forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 222
if you really want to change, the best thing you can do is choose which habits to acquire and which to get rid of and then go about doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 223
I‚Äôve learned that it is more effective to train that subconscious, emotional you the same way you would teach a child to behave the way you would like him or her to behave‚Äîwith loving kindness and persistence so that the right habits are acquired.&lt;/p&gt;

The left hemisphere reasons sequentially, analyzes details, and excels at linear analysis. ‚ÄúLeft-brained‚Äù or ‚Äúlinear‚Äù thinkers who are analytically strong are often called ‚Äúbright.‚Äù 2.¬†The right hemisphere thinks across categories, recognizes themes, and synthesizes the big picture. ‚ÄúRight-brained‚Äù or ‚Äúlateral‚Äù thinkers with more street smarts are often called ‚Äúsmart.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

side. Our experience has been that left-brained folks tend to see right-brained folks as ‚Äúspacey‚Äù or ‚Äúabstract,‚Äù while right-brained thinkers tend to find left-brained thinkers ‚Äúliteral‚Äù or ‚Äúnarrow.‚Äù I have seen wonderful results occur when people know where their own and others‚Äô inclinations lie, realize that both ways of thinking are invaluable, and assign responsibilities accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 224
We can all learn new facts and skills, but can we also learn to change how we are inclined to think? The answer is a qualified yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 226
That is because the intuitive thinker‚Äôs attention is focused on the context first and the details second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 227
Planning vs.¬†perceiving. Some people like to live in a planned, orderly way and others prefer flexibility and spontaneity.35 Planners (or ‚ÄúJudgers‚Äù in Myers-Briggs terms) like to focus on a plan and stick with it, while perceivers are prone to focus on what‚Äôs happening around them and adapt to it. Perceivers work from the outside in; they see things happening and work backward to understand the cause and how to respond; they also see many possibilities that they compare and choose from‚Äîoften so many that they are confused by them. In contrast, planners work from the inside out, first figuring out what they want to achieve and then how things should unfold. Planners and perceivers have trouble appreciating each other. Perceivers see new things and change direction often. This is discomforting to planners, who weigh precedent much more heavily in their decision making, and assume if it was done in a certain way before, it should be done in the same way again. Similarly, planners can discomfort perceivers by being seemingly rigid and slow to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

Workplace Personality Inventory. Another assessment we use is the Workplace Personality Inventory, a test based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor. It anticipates behavior and predicts job fit and satisfaction, singling out certain key characteristics/qualities, including persistence, independence, stress tolerance, and analytical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 229
This test helps us understand what people value and how they will make trade-offs between their values.&lt;/p&gt;

Likewise, someone who is bad at Rule Following may be more likely to think independently.&lt;/p&gt;

Practical Thinker + Determined. I‚Äôve found that shapers tend to share attributes such as intense curiosity and a compulsive need to make sense of things, independent thinking that verges on rebelliousness, a need to dream big and unconventionally, a practicality and determination to push through all obstacles to achieve their goals, and a knowledge of their own and others‚Äô weaknesses and strengths so they can orchestrate teams to achieve them. Perhaps even more importantly, they can hold conflicting thoughts simultaneously and look at them from different angles. They typically love to knock things around with other really smart people and can easily navigate back and forth between the big picture and the granular details, counting both as equally important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 231
Nature made everything and everyone for a purpose. The courage that‚Äôs needed the most isn‚Äôt the kind that drives you to prevail over others, but the kind that allows you to be true to your truest self, no matter what other people want you to be.&lt;/p&gt;

Make your decisions as expected value calculations. Think of every decision as a bet with a probability and a reward for being right and a probability and a penalty for being wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 252
Sometimes it‚Äôs smart to take a chance even when the odds are overwhelmingly against you if the cost of being wrong is negligible relative to the reward that comes with the slim chance of being right. As the saying goes, ‚ÄúIt never hurts to ask.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

1.¬†Slow down your thinking so you can note the criteria you are using to make your decision. 2.¬†Write the criteria down as a principle. 3.¬†Think about those criteria when you have an outcome to assess, and refine them before the next ‚Äúone of those‚Äù comes along.&lt;/p&gt;

Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is a great skill that you should develop no matter what, as it will help you develop guardrails that will prevent you from doing what you shouldn‚Äôt be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

a high level, we look for people who think independently, argue open-mindedly and assertively, and above all else value the intense pursuit of truth and excellence, and through it, the rapid improvement of themselves and the organization. Because we treat work as more than just what we do to make a living, we look at every potential hire not just as an employee but as someone we‚Äôd want share our lives with. We insist that the people we work with are considerate and have a high sense of personal accountability to do the difficult, right things. We look for people with generous natures and high standards of fairness. Most important, they must be able to put their egos aside and assess themselves candidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 407
a.¬†Think through which values, abilities, and skills you are looking for (in that order). Values are the deep-seated beliefs that motivate behaviors and determine people‚Äôs compatibilities with each other. People will fight for their values, and they are likely to fight with people who don‚Äôt share them. Abilities are ways of thinking and behaving. Some people are great learners and fast processors; others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 407
possess the ability to see things at a higher level. Some focus more on the particulars; still others think creatively or logically or with supreme organization. Skills are learned tools, such as being able to speak a foreign&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 407
While values and abilities are unlikely to change much, most skills can be acquired in a limited amount of time (e.g., software proficiency can be learned) and often change in worth (today‚Äôs most in-demand programming language is likely to be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 408
Since at Bridgewater the key shared values that maintain our culture are meaningful work and meaningful relationships, radical truth and radical transparency, an open-minded willingness to explore harsh realities including one‚Äôs own weaknesses, a sense of ownership, a drive for excellence, and the willingness to do the good but difficult things, we look for highly capable people who deeply want all of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 413
But when it comes to assessing a candidate‚Äôs common sense, vision, creativity, or decision-making abilities, school records are of limited value.&lt;/p&gt;

we had literally hundreds of data points on the specific attributes required for the job, including synthesis, knowing what he didn‚Äôt know, and managing at the right level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 425
Give people your thoughts on how they might approach their decisions, but don‚Äôt dictate to them. The most useful thing you can do is to get in sync with them, exploring how they are doing things and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 425
Feedback should reflect what is succeeding and what is not in proportion to the actual situation, rather than in an attempt to balance compliments and criticisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 426
b.¬†Put your compliments and criticisms in perspective. It helps to clarify whether the weakness or mistake under discussion is indicative of a trainee‚Äôs total evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 426
Had I explained myself better when we sat down that second time, he could have put my comment into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 426
Think about accuracy, not implications. It‚Äôs often the case that someone receiving critical feedback gets preoccupied with the implications of that feedback instead of whether it‚Äôs true. This is a mistake. As I‚Äôll explain later, conflating the ‚Äúwhat is‚Äù with the ‚Äúwhat to do about it‚Äù typically leads to bad decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 427
Your assessment of how Responsible Parties are performing should be based not on whether they‚Äôre doing it your way but on whether they‚Äôre doing it in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 427
Learn from success as well as from failure. Radical truth doesn‚Äôt require you to be negative all the time. Point out examples of jobs done well and the causes of their success. This reinforces the actions that led to the results and creates role models for those who are learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 427
The greatest gift you can give someone is the power to be successful. Giving people the opportunity to struggle rather than giving them the things they are struggling for will make them stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 428
Compliments are easy to give but they don‚Äôt help people stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 428
While it is important to be clear to people about what they are doing well, it is even more important to point out their weaknesses and have them reflect on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 428
Build your synthesis from the specifics up. By synthesizing, I mean converting a lot of data into an accurate picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 434
Put things in perspective by reminding them that their pain is the pain that comes with learning and personal evolution‚Äîand that knowing the truth will put them on the path to a much better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 435
Knowing how people operate and being able to judge whether that way of operating will lead to good results is more important than knowing what they did. Knowing what people are like is the best indicator of how well they are likely to handle their responsibilities in the future. At Bridgewater, we call this ‚Äúpaying more attention to the swing than the shot.‚Äù Since good and bad outcomes can arise from circumstances that might not have had anything to do with how the individual handled the situation, it is preferable to assess people based on both their reasoning and their outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 435
Doing this has taught me a lot about how to assess others‚Äô logic, and how to have better logic myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 436
Abilities, especially right-brained abilities, are more difficult to assess. When thinking about why someone is a poor performer, openly consider whether it is a problem with their abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

Manage as Someone Operating a Machine to Achieve a Goal&lt;/p&gt;

Build great metrics. Metrics show how the machine is working by providing numbers and setting off alert lights in a dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 453
Remember that for every case you deal with, your approach should have two purposes¬†.¬†.¬†. .¬†.¬†. 1) to move you closer to your goal, and 2) to train and test your machine (i.e., your&lt;/p&gt;

who can see the goals are usually able to synthesize too. One way to test this: If you ask a high-level question like ‚ÄúHow is goal XYZ going?‚Äù a good answer will provide a synthesis up-front of how XYZ is going overall and, if needed, will support it by accounting for the tasks that were done to&lt;/p&gt;

it. People should know the plans and designs within their departments. If you decide to diverge from an agreed-upon path, be sure to communicate your thoughts to the relevant parties and get their views so that you are all clear about the new direction. This allows people to buy into the plan or express their lack of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 476

skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 77
According to Gallagher, decades of research contradict this understanding. Our brains instead construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 77
As Gallagher summarizes: ‚ÄúWho you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love‚Äîis the sum of what you focus on.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

The third point responds to the difficulty of designing optimal solutions while under pressure. Trying to decide in the presence of an adversary narrows your vision. Having a lot at stake inhibits creativity. So does searching for the one right solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 444
Before trying to reach agreement, invent options for mutual gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 446
However, you can counter such a negotiator by insisting that his single say-so is not enough and that the agreement must reflect some fair standard independent of the naked will of either side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 516
Routinely, they fail to interpret what you say in the way you intend and do not mean what you understand them to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 521
it is worth asking yourself, ‚ÄúAm I paying enough attention to the people problem?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 536
people draw from comments on substance unfounded inferences,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 536
which they then treat as facts about that person‚Äôs intentions and attitudes toward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 582
The ability to see the situation as the other side sees it, as difficult as it may be, is one of the most important skills a negotiator can possess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 594
Don‚Äôt deduce their intentions from your fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 631
Give them a stake in the outcome by making sure they participate in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 635
If you want the other side to accept a disagreeable conclusion, it is crucial that you involve them in the process of reaching that conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 686
Pay attention to ‚Äúcore concerns.‚Äù Many emotions in negotiation are driven by a core set of five interests: autonomy, the desire to make your own choices and control your own fate; appreciation, the desire to be recognized and valued; affiliation, the desire to belong as an accepted member of some peer group; role, the desire to have a meaningful purpose; and status, the desire to feel fairly seen and acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 692
we apply our general tendency toward either-or thinking to our self-perception: ‚ÄúI am a kind person.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a good manager.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 696
If you find a counterpart‚Äôs behavior oddly out of character or feel as if you have unexpectedly stepped on a land mine in your conversation, think about whether they might be experiencing a threat to their identity from something you have said or might say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 698
if you find yourself feeling off-balance and emotional, ask yourself if your sense of identity feels threatened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 703
Making your feelings or theirs an explicit focus of discussion will not only underscore the seriousness of the problem, it will also make the negotiations less reactive and more ‚Äúpro-active.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 707
People obtain psychological release through the simple process of recounting their grievances to an attentive audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 729
An apology may be one of the least costly and most rewarding investments you can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 759
‚ÄúDid I understand correctly that you are saying that ‚Ä¶?‚Äù the other side will realize that they are not just killing time, not just going through a routine. They will also feel the satisfaction of being heard and understood. It has been said that the cheapest concession you can make to the other side is to let them know they have been heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 762
to pay close attention to what is said, to ask the other party to spell out carefully and clearly exactly what they mean, and to request that ideas be repeated if there is any ambiguity or uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 765
Many consider it a good tactic not to give the other side‚Äôs case too much attention, and not to admit any legitimacy in their point of view. A good negotiator does just the reverse. Unless you acknowledge what they are saying and demonstrate that you understand them, they may believe you have not heard them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 770
‚ÄúLet me see whether I follow what you are telling me. From your point of view, the situation looks like this. ‚Ä¶‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 771
As you repeat what you understood them to have said, phrase it positively from their point of view, making the strength of their case clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 772
You might say, ‚ÄúYou have a strong case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 773
Here‚Äôs the way it strikes me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 774
But unless you can convince them that you do grasp how they see it, you may be unable to get them to hear when you explain your viewpoint to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 776
If you can put their case better than they can, and then refute it, you maximize the chance of initiating a constructive dialogue on the merits and minimize the chance of their believing you have misunderstood them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 789
‚ÄúOpen covenants privately arrived at.‚Äù No matter how many people are involved in a negotiation, important decisions are typically made when no more than two people are in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 790
Speak about yourself, not about them. In many negotiations, each side explains and condemns at great length the motivations and intentions of the other side. It is more persuasive, however, to describe a problem in terms of its impact on you than in terms of what they did or why: ‚ÄúI feel let down‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúYou broke your word.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe feel discriminated against‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a racist.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 795
convey the same information without provoking a defensive reaction that will prevent them from taking it in.&lt;/p&gt;

Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs favorite technique was to ask an adversary if he could borrow a certain book. This would flatter the person and give him the comfortable feeling of knowing that Franklin owed him a favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 848
For a wise solution reconcile interests, not positions This story is typical of many negotiations. Since the parties‚Äô problem appears to be a conflict of positions, and since their goal is to agree on a position, they naturally tend to think and talk about positions‚Äîand in the process often reach an impasse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 853
Interests define the problem. The basic problem in a negotiation lies not in conflicting positions, but in the conflict between each side‚Äôs needs, desires, concerns, and fears. The parties may say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 861
the hubbub of positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 874
Reconciling interests rather than positions works for two reasons. First, for every interest there usually exist several possible positions that could satisfy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 876
When you do look behind opposed positions for the motivating interests, you can often find an alternative position that meets not only your interests but theirs as well. In the Sinai, demilitarization was one such alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 878
Reconciling interests rather than compromising between positions also works because behind opposed positions lie many more interests than conflicting ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 879
Behind opposed positions lie shared and compatible interests, as well as conflicting ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 880
We tend to assume that because the other side‚Äôs positions are opposed to ours, their interests must also be opposed. If we have an interest in defending ourselves, then they must want to attack us. If we have an interest in minimizing the rent, then their interest must be to maximize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 882
reveal the existence of many more interests that are shared or compatible than ones that are opposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 961
security economic well-being a sense of belonging recognition control over one‚Äôs life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 984
The purpose of negotiating is to serve your interests. The chance of that happening increases when you communicate them. The other side may not know what your interests are, and you may not know theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 992
Make your interests come alive. If you go with a raging ulcer to see a doctor, you should not hope for much relief if you describe it as a mild stomachache. It is your job to have the other side understand exactly how important and legitimate your interests are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 998
Inviting the other side to ‚Äúcorrect me if I‚Äôm wrong‚Äù shows your openness, and if they do not correct you, it implies that they accept your description of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,005
People listen better if they feel that you have understood them. They tend to think that those who understand them are intelligent and sympathetic people whose own opinions may be worth listening to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,013
Put the problem before your answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,015
you do, you can be quite certain that the representatives will not be listening to the reasons. They have heard your position and are no doubt busy preparing arguments against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,018
If you want someone to listen and understand your reasoning, give your interests and reasoning first and your conclusions or proposals later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,030
The question ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù has two quite different meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,031
The other looks forward for a purpose and treats our behavior as subject to our free will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,064
One useful rule of thumb is to give positive support to the human beings on the other side equal in strength to the vigor with which you emphasize the problem. This combination of support and attack may seem inconsistent. Psychologically, it is; the inconsistency helps make it work. A well-known theory of psychology, the theory of cognitive dissonance, holds that people dislike inconsistency and will act to eliminate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,070
Fighting hard on the substantive issues increases the pressure for an effective solution; giving support to the human beings on the other side tends to improve your relationship and to increase the likelihood of reaching agreement. It is the combination of support and attack that works; either alone is likely to be insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,079
Often you are negotiating along a single dimension,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,086
He expands the pie before dividing it. Skill at inventing options is one of the most useful assets a negotiator can have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,088
Yet all too often negotiators end up like the proverbial children who quarreled over an orange. After they finally agreed to divide the orange in half, the first child took one half, ate the fruit, and threw away the peel, while the other threw away the fruit and used the peel from the second half in baking a cake. All too often negotiators ‚Äúleave money on the table‚Äù ‚Äî they fail to reach agreement when they might have, or the agreement they do reach could have been better for each side. Too many negotiations end up with half an orange for each side instead of the whole fruit for one and the whole peel for the other. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,093
As valuable as it is to have many options, people involved in a negotiation rarely sense a need for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,095
All available answers appear to lie along a straight line between their position and yours. Often the only creative thinking shown is to suggest splitting the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,097
In most negotiations there are four major obstacles that inhibit the inventing of an abundance of options: (1) premature judgment; (2) searching for the single answer; (3) the assumption of a fixed pie; and (4) thinking that ‚Äúsolving their problem is their problem.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,100
Inventing options does not come naturally. Not inventing is the normal state of affairs,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,105
Nothing is so harmful to inventing as a critical sense waiting to pounce on the drawbacks of any new idea. Judgment hinders imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,107
Practical negotiation appears to call for practical thinking, not wild ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,107
Your creativity may be even more stifled by the presence of those on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,122
If the first impediment to creative thinking is premature criticism, the second is premature closure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,136
separate the act of inventing options from the act of judging them; (2) broaden the options on the table rather than look for a single answer; (3) search for mutual gains; and (4) invent ways of making their decisions easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,140
Invent first, decide later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,144
A brainstorming session is designed to produce as many ideas as possible to solve the problem at hand. The key ground rule is to postpone all criticism and evaluation of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,146
With those inhibitions removed, one idea should stimulate another, like firecrackers setting off one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,155
The more different a brainstorming session seems from a normal meeting, the easier it is for participants to suspend judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,157
Design an informal atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,159
Choose a facilitator. Someone at the meeting needs to facilitate‚Äîto keep the meeting on track,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,162
Seat the participants side by side facing the problem. The physical reinforces the psychological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,162
Physically sitting side by side can reinforce the mental attitude of tackling a common problem together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,165
2. Clarify the ground rules, including the no-criticism rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,168
If ideas are shot down unless they appeal to all participants, the implicit goal becomes to advance an idea that no one will shoot down. If, on the other hand, wild ideas are encouraged, even those that in fact lie well outside the realm of the possible, the group may generate from these ideas other options that are possible and that no one would previously have considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,171
to make the entire session off the record and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,172
3. Brainstorm. Once the purpose of the meeting is clear, let your imaginations go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,174
Record the ideas in full view. Recording ideas either on a whiteboard or flipcharts gives the group a tangible sense of collective achievement; it reinforces the no-criticism rule; it reduces the tendency to repeat; and it helps stimulate other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,176
After brainstorming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:make a brainstorming procedure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,177
Star the most promising ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,179
Invent improvements for promising ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,181
‚ÄúWhat I like best about that idea is. ‚Ä¶ Might it be even better if ‚Ä¶?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,192
To reduce the risk of appearing committed to any given idea, you can make a habit of advancing at least two alternatives at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,193
You can also put on the table options with which you obviously disagree. ‚ÄúI could give you the house for nothing, or you could pay me a million dollars in cash for it, or. ‚Ä¶‚Äù Since you are plainly not proposing either of these ideas, the ones that follow are labeled as mere possibilities, not proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,224
But whether you brainstorm together or not, separating the act of developing options from the act of deciding on them is extremely useful in any negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,225
Discussing options differs radically from taking positions. Whereas one side‚Äôs position will conflict with another‚Äôs, options invite other options. The very language you use differs. It consists of questions, not assertions; it is open, not closed: ‚ÄúOne option is. ‚Ä¶ What other options have you thought of?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if we agreed to this?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow about doing it this way?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow would this work?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat would be wrong with that?‚Äù Invent before you decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,230
Even with the best of intentions, participants in a brainstorming session are likely to operate on the assumption that they are really looking for the one best answer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,234
A vintner making a fine wine chooses his grapes from a number of varieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,236
The key to wise decision-making, whether in wine-making, sports, or negotiation, lies in selecting from a great number and variety of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,241
A brainstorming session frees people to think creatively. Once freed, they need ways to think about their problems and to generate constructive solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,243
The task of inventing options involves four types of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,273
Look through the eyes of different experts. Another way to generate multiple options is to examine your problem from the perspective of different professions and disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,307
Look for mutual gain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,308
The third major block to creative problem-solving lies in the assumption of a fixed pie: the less for you, the more for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,311
Even apart from a shared interest in averting joint loss, there almost always exists the possibility of joint gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,313
Identify shared interests. In theory it is obvious that shared interests help produce agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,331
a joint publicity campaign with the Chamber of Commerce to attract new companies, a reduction in taxes for existing industries that choose to expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,340
Three points about shared interests are worth remembering. First, shared interests lie latent in every negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,341
Ask yourself: Do we have a shared interest in preserving our relationship? What opportunities lie ahead for cooperation and mutual benefit? What costs would we bear if negotiations broke off? Are there common principles, like a fair price, that we both can respect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,344
Second, shared interests are opportunities, not godsends. To be of use, you need to make something out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,344
It helps to make a shared interest explicit and to formulate it as a shared goal. In other words, make it concrete and future-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,346
The tax holiday for new industries would then represent not a concession by the mayor to you but an action in pursuit of your shared goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:present what they give off as an action to reach their goal not as concession or lose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,348
stressing your shared interests can make the negotiation smoother and more amicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,350
Dovetail differing interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,352
In this case as in many others, a satisfactory agreement is made possible because each side wants different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,353
People generally assume that differences between two parties create the problem. Yet differences can also lead to a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,354
Agreement is often based on disagreement. It is as absurd to think, for example, that you should always begin by reaching agreement on the facts as it is for a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,358
Many creative agreements reflect this principle of reaching agreement through differences. Differences in interests and belief make it possible for an item to be of high benefit to you, yet low cost to the other side. Consider the nursery rhyme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,391
Look for items that are of low cost to you and high benefit to them, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,396
Impressed with the merits of their own case, people usually pay too little attention to ways of advancing their case by taking care of interests on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,411
Your task is to give them not a problem but an answer, to give them not a tough decision but an easy one. It is crucial in that process to focus your attention on the content of the decision itself. That decision is often impeded by uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,431
Search for it. Look for a decision or statement that the other side may have made in a similar situation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,432
provides an objective standard for your request and makes it easier for them to go along. Recognizing their probable desire to be consistent, thinking about what they have already done or said will help you generate options acceptable to you that also take their point of view into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,437
We often try to influence others by threats and warnings of what will happen if they do not decide as we would like. Offers are usually more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,438
Concentrate both on making them aware of the consequences they can expect if they do decide as you wish and on improving those consequences from their point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,439
How can you make your offers more credible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,440
What can you invent that might be attractive to them but low in cost to yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,446
Try to draft a proposal to which their responding with the single word ‚Äúyes‚Äù would be sufficient, realistic, and operational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,450
Therefore, generate many options before selecting among them. Invent first; decide later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,464
As discussed in Chapter 1, trying to reconcile differences on the basis of will has serious costs. No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,467
If trying to settle differences of interest on the basis of will has such high costs, the solution is to negotiate on some basis independent of the will of either side‚Äîthat is, on the basis of objective criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,481
In short, the approach is to commit yourself to reaching a solution based on principle, not pressure. Concentrate on the merits of the problem, not the mettle of the parties. Be open to reason, but closed to threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,513
Carrying on a principled negotiation involves two questions: How do you develop objective criteria,&lt;/p&gt;

In short, focus on objective criteria firmly but flexibly.&lt;/p&gt;

other side may have conflicting interests, but the two of you now have a shared goal: to determine a fair price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,577
Ask ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your theory?‚Äù If the seller starts by giving you a position, such as ‚ÄúThe price is $255,000,‚Äù ask for the theory behind that price: ‚ÄúHow did you arrive at that figure?‚Äù Treat the problem as though the seller too is looking for a fair price based on objective criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,580
Agree first on principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,581
Each standard the other side proposes becomes a lever you can then use to persuade them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,581
Your case will have more impact if it is presented in terms of their&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,582
criteria, and they will find it difficult to resist applying their criteria to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,583
Your theory is that this house should be sold for what comparable houses in the neighborhood are going for, am I right?&lt;/p&gt;

the standard, their deferring to it is not an act of weakness but an act of strength, of carrying out their word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,588
mind. In most negotiations, people use precedent and other objective standards simply as arguments in support of a position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,594
This is emphatically not what is meant by principled negotiation. Insisting that an agreement be based on objective criteria does not mean insisting that it be based solely on the criterion you advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,597
you should be willing to respond to reasons for applying another standard or for applying a standard differently. When each party is advancing a different standard, look for an objective basis for deciding between them, such as which standard has been used by the parties in the past or which standard is more widely applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,604
you might suggest putting them to a test. Agree on someone you both regard as fair and give him or her a list of the proposed criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,608
The difference between seeking agreement on the appropriate principles for deciding a matter and using principles simply as arguments to support positions is sometimes subtle, but always significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,610
A principled negotiator is open to reasoned persuasion on the merits; a positional bargainer is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,610
It is the combination of openness to reason with insistence on a solution based on objective criteria that makes principled negotiation so persuasive&lt;/p&gt;

Never yield to pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,613
hire your brother-in-law on the condition that you give in on the depth of the foundations? You would probably answer, ‚ÄúA job for my brother-in-law has nothing to do with whether the house will be safely supported on a foundation of that depth.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,615
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll settle that question on the merits too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,617
‚ÄúTrust is an entirely separate matter. The issue is how deep the foundations have to be to make the house safe.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,619
Pressure can take many forms: a bribe, a threat, a manipulative appeal to trust, or a simple refusal to budge. In all these cases, the principled response is the same: invite them to state their reasoning, suggest objective criteria you think apply, and refuse to budge except on this basis. Never yield to pressure, only to principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,627
principled negotiation is a dominant strategy over positional bargaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,630
Principle serves as your hardhearted partner who will not let you yield to pressure. It is a form of ‚Äúright makes might.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,639
Shifting discussion in a negotiation from the question of what the other side is willing to do to the question of how the matter ought to be decided does not end argument, nor does it guarantee a favorable result. It does, however, provide a strategy you can vigorously pursue without the high costs of positional bargaining.&lt;/p&gt;

When you are trying to catch an airplane your goal may seem tremendously important; looking back on it, you see you could have caught the next plane. Negotiation will often present you with a similar situation.&lt;/p&gt;

The siren song of ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs all agree and put an end to this‚Äù becomes persuasive. You may end up with a deal you should have rejected.&lt;/p&gt;

Having a bottom line makes it easier to resist pressure and temptations of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,684
But the protection afforded by adopting a bottom line involves high costs. It limits your ability to benefit from what you learn during negotiation. By definition, a bottom line is a position that is not to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,686
A bottom line also inhibits imagination. It reduces the incentive to invent a tailor-made solution that would reconcile differing interests in a way more advantageous for both you and them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,691
this. A bottom line‚Äîby its very nature rigid‚Äîis almost certain to be too rigid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,699
Is there an alternative to the bottom line? Is there a measure for agreements that will protect you against both accepting an agreement you should reject and rejecting an agreement you should accept? There is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,708
The reason you negotiate is to produce something better than the results you can obtain without negotiating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,709
What is your BATNA‚Äîyour Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement? That is the standard against which any proposed agreement should be measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,714
If you have not thought carefully about what you will do if you fail to reach an agreement, you are negotiating with your eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,718
One frequent mistake is psychologically to see your alternatives in the aggregate. You may be telling yourself that if you do not reach agreement on a salary for this job, you could always go to California, or go south, or go back to school, or write, or work on a farm, or live in Paris, or do something else. In your mind you are likely to find the sum of these alternatives more attractive than working for a specific salary in a particular job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,722
you fail to reach agreement, you will have to choose just one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,723
In most circumstances, however, the greater danger is that you are too committed to reaching agreement. Not having developed any alternative to a negotiated solution, you are unduly pessimistic about what would happen if negotiations broke off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,727
You may think to yourself, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs negotiate first and see what happens. If things don‚Äôt work out, then I‚Äôll figure out what to do.‚Äù But having at least a tentative answer to the question is absolutely essential if you are to conduct your negotiations wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,732
it is useful to identify one far from perfect agreement that is better than your BATNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,741
In fact, the relative negotiating power of two parties depends primarily upon how attractive to each is the option of not reaching agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,745
The tourist may be wealthy and ‚Äúpowerful,‚Äù but in this negotiation he will be weak indeed unless he knows approximately how much it would cost and how difficult it would be to find a comparable pot elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,749
Think for a moment about how you would feel walking into a job interview with no other job offers‚Äîonly some uncertain leads. Think how the talk about salary would go. Now contrast that with how you would feel walking in with two other job offers. How would that salary negotiation proceed? The difference is power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,760
because they were not converted into a good BATNA, proved of little use. Having an attractive BATNA, the small town had more ability to affect the outcome of the negotiation than did one of the world‚Äôs largest corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,763
Vigorous exploration of what you will do if you do not reach agreement can greatly strengthen your hand. Attractive alternatives are not just sitting there waiting for you; you usually have to develop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,764
(1) inventing a list of actions you might conceivably take if no agreement is reached; (2) improving some of the more promising ideas and converting them into practical alternatives; and (3) selecting, tentatively, the one alternative that seems best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,770
The second stage is to improve the best of your ideas and turn the most promising into real alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,777
Having gone through this effort, you now have a BATNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,777
Judge every offer against it. The better your BATNA, the greater your ability to improve the terms of any negotiated agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,779
It is easier to break off negotiations if you know where you‚Äôre going. The&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,780
greater your willingness to break off negotiations, the more forcefully you can present your interests and the basis on which you believe an agreement should be reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,783
If they think you lack a good alternative when in fact you have one, then you should almost certainly let them know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,789
reached. Perhaps they have a vague notion that they have a great many alternatives and are under the influence of their cumulative total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,789
they appear to overestimate their BATNA, you will want to help them think through whether their expectations are realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,803
Apply knowledge, time, money, people, connections, and wits into devising the best solution for you independent of the other side‚Äôs assent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,804
The more easily and happily you can walk away from a negotiation, the greater your capacity to affect its outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,806
Developing your BATNA is perhaps the most effective course of action you can take in dealing with a seemingly more powerful negotiator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,826
If the other side announces a firm position, you may be tempted to criticize and reject it. If they criticize your proposal, you may be tempted to defend it and dig yourself in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,827
If they attack you, you may be tempted to defend yourself and counterattack. In short, if they push you hard, you will tend to push back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,834
Break the vicious cycle by refusing to react. Instead of pushing back, sidestep their attack and deflect it against the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,836
Rather than resisting their force, channel it into exploring interests, inventing options for mutual gain, and searching for independent standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,847
ask them how they think it addresses the problem at hand. Treat their position as one option and objectively examine the extent to which&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,871
Examine their negative judgments to find out their underlying interests and to improve your ideas from their point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,876
turn the situation around and ask for their advice. Ask them what they would do if they were in your position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,882
Recast an attack on you as an attack on the problem. When the other side attacks you personally ‚Äî as frequently happens ‚Äî resist the temptation to defend yourself or to attack them. Instead, sit back and allow them to let off steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,883
Listen to them, show you understand what they are saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,887
Ask questions and pause. Those engaged in negotiation jujitsu use two key tools. The first is to use questions instead of statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,888
Statements generate resistance, whereas questions generate answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,893
Silence is one of your best weapons. Use it. If they have made an unreasonable proposal or an attack you regard as unjustified, the best thing to do may be to sit there and not say a word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,894
If you have asked an honest question to which they have provided an insufficient answer, just wait. People tend to feel uncomfortable with silence, particularly if they have doubts about the merits of something they have said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,899
Silence often creates the impression of a stalemate that the other side will feel impelled to break by answering your question or coming up with a new suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,900
When you ask questions, pause. Don‚Äôt take them off the hook by going right on with another question or some comment of your own. Some of the most effective negotiating you will ever do is when you are not talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,973
Note that in most situations you do not have to get anyone‚Äôs consent to start using the one-text procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,974
Simply prepare a draft and ask for criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,992
The essence of principled negotiation lies in remaining open to persuasion by objective facts and principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,000
Making yourself open to correction and persuasion is a pillar in the strategy of principled negotiation. You can convince the other side to be open to the principles and objective standards you suggest only if you show yourself open to the ones they suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,002
‚ÄúWe appreciate what you‚Äôve done for us‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,007
‚ÄúWe have nothing against you personally. We think you‚Äôre a generous person.‚Äù He puts himself on her side. He defuses any threat she may feel to her self-image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,008
Praise and support, moreover, imply that the person will continue to deserve them. After being praised, Mrs.¬†Jones now has a slight emotional investment in Turnbull‚Äôs approval of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,011
‚ÄúOur concern is fairness‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,014
Turnbull takes a basic stand on principle and announces his intention to stick to it;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,015
he must be persuaded on the basis of principle. At the same time, he lets Mrs.¬†Jones know he is open to persuasion along the lines of this principle. She is thus left with little choice but to reason with him in pursuit of her interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,018
His ends, he claims, are a fair balance between rent paid and time spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,020
‚ÄúWe would like to settle this on the basis of independent standards, not of who can do what to whom‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,035
But instead of reacting, Turnbull keeps his temper and brings the negotiation back to the merits. This is a good example of negotiation jujitsu. He deflects Mrs.¬†Jones‚Äôs attack by taking responsibility for her mistaken perceptions, and he tries to persuade her of his sincere interest in principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,037
He does not hide either his selfish interests or his leverage over her; on the contrary, he makes both explicit. Once they are acknowledged, he can distinguish them from the merits and they can cease being an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,047
however, by expressing his gratitude once more and then defining the question of trust as irrelevant. Turnbull at once reaffirms his appreciation of Mrs.¬†Jones while he remains firm on the principle. In doing so, he avoids connecting the two thoughts with ‚Äúbut,‚Äù implicitly using ‚Äúand‚Äù instead. ‚ÄúBut,‚Äù sometimes called the ‚Äúgreat eraser,‚Äù has a tendency to negate the first thing you say by implying that only one of two statements can be true, making it either/or. ‚ÄúAnd‚Äù underscores the more complex reality that both thoughts can be true at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,065
Analysis. Statements of fact can feel lecturing or threatening. Whenever you can, ask a question instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,069
Phrasing each piece of information as a question allows Mrs.¬†Jones to participate, listen to the information, evaluate it, and either accept or correct it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,070
Turnbull communicates the same information to her but in a less provocative manner. He reduces the heat still further by attributing a particularly pointed question to his absent roommate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,076
A principled negotiator neither accepts nor rejects the other side‚Äôs positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,076
To keep the dialogue focused on the merits, Turnbull questions Mrs.¬†Jones about the reasons for her position. He does not ask whether there were any reasons. He assumes there are good reasons. This flattering assumption leads the other side to search for reasons even if there are none, thus keeping the negotiation on the basis of principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,086
Analysis. Principled negotiation requires good communication. Before responding to Mrs.¬†Jones‚Äôs arguments, Turnbull restates to her in positive terms what he has heard to make sure he has indeed understood her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,087
Once she feels understood, she can relax and discuss the problem constructively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,088
She can‚Äôt dismiss his arguments on the grounds that they do not take into account what she knows. She is more likely to listen now and be more receptive. In trying to sum up her point of view, Turnbull establishes a cooperative game in which both are making sure he understands the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,093
Analysis. A good negotiator rarely makes an important decision on the spot. The psychological pressure to be nice and to give in is too great. A little time and distance help disentangle the people from the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,097
He shows not only decisiveness but also control over the course of the negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,103
Turnbull: Let me show you where I have trouble following some of your reasons for the extra $268 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,108
Analysis. In principled negotiation you present your reasons first before offering a proposal. If principles come afterward, they appear not as the objective criteria that any proposal should satisfy but as mere justifications for an arbitrary position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,110
For Turnbull to explain his reasons first shows his openness to persuasion and his awareness of the need to convince Mrs.¬†Jones. If he announced his proposal first, Mrs.¬†Jones probably would not bother to listen to the reasons that followed. Her mind would be elsewhere, considering what objections and counterproposals she could make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,114
In preparing for your negotiation, it helps to think about what standards would be useful, who might be able to provide them, and how to frame your questions to elicit the most relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,116
‚ÄúOne fair solution might be ‚Ä¶‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,120
Analysis. Turnbull presents a proposal not as his, but as a fair option that deserves their joint consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,120
He does not claim it is the only fair solution, but one fair solution. He is specific without digging himself into a position and inviting rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,127
Turnbull is trying to make it easy for Mrs.¬†Jones to say yes to his proposal. So he starts by making it clear that all it takes for the problem to go away is Mrs.¬†Jones‚Äôs agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,130
without upsetting the negotiations? He bases the alternative on objective principle by attributing it to a legal authority‚Äîthe hearing examiner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,131
He distances himself personally from the suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,144
Incorporating her interests into the agreement not only gives her more of a stake in it but also allows Mrs.¬†Jones to save face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,148
Paul and I do appreciate, Mrs.¬†Jones, all that you‚Äôve done for us, and I‚Äôm pleased that we‚Äôve settled this last problem fairly and amicably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,194
Don‚Äôt attack people personally for using a tactic you consider illegitimate. If they get defensive it may be more difficult for them to give up the tactic, and they may be left with a residue of anger that will fester and interfere with other issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,198
Don‚Äôt be diverted from the negotiation by the urge to teach them a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,202
Invent options for mutual gain. Suggest alternative games to play. ‚ÄúHow about our undertaking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,204
Insist on using objective criteria. Above&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,212
Some common tricky tactics Tricky tactics can be divided into three categories: deliberate deception, psychological warfare, and positional pressure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,223
A practice of verifying factual assertions reduces the incentive for deception, and your risk of being cheated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,450
expected. In contrast, looking behind positions for interests, inventing options for mutual gain, and finding and using objective criteria take hard work and, when the other side seems recalcitrant, emotional restraint and maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,461
How complex are the issues? The more complex the subject matter, the more unwise it is to engage in positional bargaining. Complexity calls for careful analysis of interests that are shared or that can be creatively dovetailed, and then for brainstorming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,463
How important is it to maintain a good working relationship? If the other side is a valued customer or client, maintaining your ongoing relationship may be more important to you than the outcome of any one deal. This does not mean you should be less persistent in pursuing your interests, but it does suggest avoiding tactics such as threats or ultimatums that involve a high&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,482
Bargaining over positions does the least harm if it comes after you have identified each other‚Äôs interests, invented options for mutual gain, and discussed relevant standards of fairness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,486
Yet using external standards improves on haggling in three ways: An outcome informed even by conflicting standards of fairness and community practice is likely to be wiser than an arbitrary result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,506
Using external standards often helps narrow the range of disagreement and may help expand the area of potential agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,527
Many negotiators are overly optimistic in assuming that they are more clever than their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,548
The human propensity for defensive and reactive behavior is one reason so many negotiations fail when agreement would otherwise make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,551
The more seriously you disagree with someone, the more important it is that you be able to deal well with that disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,561
Rather, substantive issues need to be disentangled from relationship and process issues. The content of a possible agreement needs to be separated from questions of how you talk about it and how you deal with the other side. Each set of issues needs to be negotiated on its own merits. The following list illustrates the distinction: Substantive Issues Terms Conditions Prices Dates Numbers Liabilities Relationship Issues Balance of emotion and reason Ease of communication Degree of trust and reliability Attitude of acceptance (or rejection) Relative emphasis on persuasion (or coercion) Degree of mutual understanding People often assume that there is a trade-off between pursuing a good substantive outcome and pursuing a good relationship. We disagree. A good working relationship tends to make it easier to get good substantive outcomes (for both sides). Good substantive outcomes tend to make a good relationship even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,575
Our point is that you should not give in for the purpose of trying to improve a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,587
Our behavior should be designed to model and encourage the behavior we would prefer and to avoid any reward for the behavior we dislike, both without compromising our substantive interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,600
It is the perception that is skewed, not the response to that perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,601
On the other hand, if you inquire empathetically, taking their feelings seriously and trying to trace their reasoning to its roots, it is sometimes possible to effect change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,603
Working with them, you may discover a logical leap, a factual misperception, or a traumatic association from an earlier time that, once brought to light, can be examined and modified by the people themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,604
In essence, you are looking for the psychological interests behind their position, to help them find a way to meet more of their interests more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,656
A key point, worth repeating, is that negotiating does not require compromising your principles. More often success is achieved by finding a solution that is arguably consistent with each side‚Äôs principles.&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúOne of the hardest challenges is to hire people from outside the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 5
What is a resume? It is a record of a person‚Äôs career with all of the accomplishments embellished and all the failures removed.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 6
‚ÄúLook, I hired your resume. But unfortunately, what I got was you!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 6
‚ÄúOtherwise smart people struggle to hire strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 7
managers cling to their favorite methods even when evidence suggests they don‚Äôt work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 7
Forgers can pass off fake paintings as real ones to the time-pressed buyer, and people who want a job badly enough can fake an interview if it lasts only a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 8
Unfortunately, managers rarely coordinate their efforts, leaving everybody to ask the same, superficial questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 8
but knowledge and ability to do the job are not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 9
‚ÄúWhat type of animal would you be?‚Äù The question has a truly voodoo answer key. ‚ÄúI look for people who have a witty answer.‚Äù Not only do questions like this lack any relevance or scientific basis, but they are utterly useless as predictors of on-the-job performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 10

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 10
Savvy candidates can easily fake the answers based on the job for which they are vying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 10
The Fortune-Teller. Just like a fortune-teller looking in a crystal ball to predict the future, some interviewers like to ask their candidates to look into the future regarding the job at hand by asking hypothetical questions: ‚ÄúWhat would you do? How would you do it? Could you do it?‚Äù Fifty years of academic literature on interview methods makes a strong case against using these types of questions during interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 11
Remember, it‚Äôs the walk that counts, not the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 11
but one of the painful truths of hiring is this: it is hard to see people for who they really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 12
We define an A Player this way: a candidate who has at least a 90 percent chance of achieving a set of outcomes that only the top 10 percent of possible candidates could achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 14
‚ÄúHiring A Players is not everything. But it is one of the most important skills to growing a large private equity firm, or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 15
person to accomplish in a role. It is not a job description, but rather a set of outcomes and competencies that define a job done well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 15
Systematic sourcing before you have slots to fill ensures you have high-quality candidates waiting when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 15
a series of structured interviews that allow you to gather the relevant facts about a person so you can rate your scorecard and make an informed hiring decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 16
Selling the right way ensures you avoid the biggest pitfalls that cause the very people you want the most to take their talents elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 20
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what we need at all! We don‚Äôt need a tactical planner. We need a visionary leader. We need someone who can survey the market and help us devise new strategies and create new products. We need someone to keep us ahead of the competition.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 20
The first failure point of hiring is not being crystal clear about what you really want the person you hire to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 21
‚ÄúIn hiring, everything is situational,‚Äù he&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 21
You are going to need different types of leaders at different phases of organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 21
That meant I needed somebody with high emotional intelligence, really strong knowledge of the business, really good interpersonal skills, and the ability to build bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 21
The scorecard is composed of three parts: the job‚Äôs mission, outcomes, and competencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 23
If you‚Äôve defined the position correctly from the outset, you should be looking for narrow but deep competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 25
You wouldn‚Äôt let your family-practice doctor perform open-heart surgery on you, and in the same way you shouldn‚Äôt look for a full team of generalists to solve your business problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 25
‚ÄúI think success comes from having the right person in the right job at the right time with the right skill set for the business problem that exists.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 26
Gores has learned to rely on people with job-specific talents, rather than gunning for all-around athletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 26
‚ÄúEach target and company has different needs for the CEO and any management role,‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 28
‚ÄúCreate and implement a new marketing campaign within 180 days of start date.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 29
Critical Competencies for A Players ‚Ä¢ Efficiency. Able to produce significant output with minimal wasted effort. ‚Ä¢ Honesty/integrity. Does not cut corners ethically. Earns trust and maintains confidences. Does what is right, not just what is politically expedient. Speaks plainly and truthfully. ‚Ä¢ Organization and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 30
Plans, organizes, schedules, and budgets in an efficient, productive manner. Focuses on key priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 30
‚Ä¢ Aggressiveness. Moves quickly and takes a forceful stand without being overly abrasive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 30
Follow-through on commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 30
Lives up to verbal and written agreements, regardless of personal cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 30
Intelligence. Learns quickly. Demonstrates ability to quickly and proficiently understand and absorb new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 30
Analytical skills. Able to structure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 30
and process qualitative or quantitative data and draw insightful conclusions from it. Exhibits a probing mind and achieves penetrating insights. ‚Ä¢ Attention to detail. Does not let important details slip through the cracks or derail a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 30
‚Ä¢ Persistence. Demonstrates tenacity and willingness to go the distance to get something done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 30
‚Ä¢ Proactivity. Acts without being told what to do. Brings new ideas to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 31
‚Ä¢ Ability to hire A Players (for managers). Sources, selects, and sells A Players to join a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 31
Enthusiasm. Exhibits passion and excitement over work. Has a can-do attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 31
Listening skills. Lets others speak and seeks to understand their viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 31
Openness to criticism and ideas. Often solicits feedback and reacts calmly to criticism or negative feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 31
‚Ä¢ Communication. Speaks and writes clearly and articulately without being overly verbose or talkative. Maintains this standard in all forms of written communication, including e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 33
‚ÄúNumber two is commitment. Theirs to you and yours to them. That is a difficult thing to assess, but it really matters. I want people who are committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 33
‚ÄúThird, are they coachable? I underestimated this earlier in my career. You can pass on learning and shortcut their development if they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 34
‚ÄúWhat adjectives would you use to describe our culture?‚Äù Jot down their responses on a flip chart or whiteboard. It won‚Äôt take long before a picture emerges. We recently put a new client through this exercise. Soon the room buzzed with words such as analytical, fast-paced, and informal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 38
By translating your culture and values into a series of competencies that matter for every job, you can avoid making the mistake of not evaluating candidates for the cultural fits that are absolutely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 38
crucial to your enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 40
Scorecards solve that problem and ensure not just that you have A Players but that the A Players are delivering A performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 41
‚ÄúThe thing we valued at EMC was the willingness to go one more step than the next guy, to go one more step to service the customer,‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 41
To accomplish that, we specifically hired people who had an unusually high customer service attitude.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 41
Marino wasn‚Äôt hiring merely to fill a position. He was hiring to reinforce corporate strategy and culture, and he held the people he brought in accountable for accomplishing and demonstrating that every day. The results speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 41
Set expectations with new hires ‚Ä¢ Monitor employee progress over time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 41
Objectify your annual review system ‚Ä¢ Allow you to rate your team annually as part of a talent review process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 42
The whole key, whether you are hiring, promoting, or managing for performance in the current job, is that you have clear expectations. Having a clear, focused approach helps us be better managers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 42
and therefore helps the people we hire have a higher likelihood of success.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 43
The board decided on a few competencies that really mattered to fit the culture they wanted to build and support the outcomes for the role. They wanted someone who was professional, disciplined, caring, fair, and diplomatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 44
2. OUTCOMES. Develop three to eight specific, objective outcomes that a person must accomplish to achieve an A performance. For example, ‚ÄúImprove customer satisfaction on a ten-point scale from 7.1 to 9.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 44
by December 31.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 46
‚ÄúWe found the process of gathering data from each candidate and comparing it to our scorecard very helpful and worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 47
They consider themselves chief recruiting officers and expect all of their managers to view their jobs the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 47
then. They are always sourcing, always on the lookout for new talent, always identifying the who before a new hire is really needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 48
Take a moment and think about how passive such an approach is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 48
The overwhelming evidence from our field interviews is that ads are a good way to generate a tidal wave of resumes, but a lousy way to generate the right flow of candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 49
Of all the ways to source candidates, the number one method is to ask for referrals from your personal and professional networks. This approach may feel scary and timeconsuming, but it is the single most effective way to find potential A Players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 50
us, a full 77 percent of them cited referrals as their top technique for generating a flow of the right candidates for their businesses. Yet among average managers it is the least often practiced approach to sourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 50
I am constantly on the hunt for talented people to bring into my company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 51
names. Ryan captures those names on a list, and he makes a point of calling a few new people from his list every week. Then he stays in touch with those who seem to have the most promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 51
‚ÄúWho are the most talented people you know that I should hire?‚Äù‚Äîcan easily generate another fifty to one hundred names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 51
no time you will have moved into many other networks and enriched your personal talent pool with real ability. But don‚Äôt stop there. Bring your broader business contacts in on the hunt, too. Ask your customers for the names of the most talented salespeople who call on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 51
Ask your business partners who they think are the most effective business developers. Do the same with your suppliers to identify their strongest purchasing agents. Join professional organizations and ask the people you meet through events. People you interact with every day are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 51
the most powerful sources of talent you will ever find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 51
‚ÄúSay, now that I have told you what I do, who are the most talented people you know who could be a good fit for my company?‚Äù Do that, and you will turn a common social question into a sourcing opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 52
Ryan nurtured his relationship with Case over a period of many years before finally convincing Case to succeed him as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 53
What sets Patrick Ryan apart from so many other executives is how he actively built his network through referrals, then followed up with high-potential candidates to maintain the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 54
‚ÄúIt takes A Players to know A Players,‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 54
‚ÄúOur success rate is 60 percent higher for people who are referred by somebody else in our&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 54
At ghSMART, we‚Äôve made in-house referrals a key part not only of our staffing policies but also of promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 61
The conversation does not have to be long. We frequently begin with something simple like, ‚ÄúSue recommended that you and I connect. I understand you are great at what you do. I am always on the lookout for talented people and would love the chance to get to know you. Even if you are perfectly content in your current job, I‚Äôd love to introduce myself and hear about your career interests.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 61
Most people will be thrilled to chat. Done well, you will find you can connect with forty or more new people per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 61
One more thing. When you are done with the call, assuming you were even moderately impressed with what you heard, be sure to ask the key follow-up question: ‚ÄúNow that you know a little about me, who are the most talented people you know who might be a good fit for my company?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 71
Ideally, a candidate will share career goals that match your company‚Äôs needs. If he or she lacks goals or sounds like an echo of your own Web site, screen the person out. You are done with the call. Talented people know what they want to do and are not afraid to tell you about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 72
you still find yourself struggling, we recommend that you put the fear of the reference check into the person. You say, ‚ÄúIf you advance to the next step in our process, we will ask for your help in setting up some references with bosses, peers, and subordinates. Okay?‚Äù The candidate will say, ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù Then you say, ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm curious. What do you think they will say are some things you are not good at, or not interested&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 72
in?‚Äù Now you‚Äôll get an honest and full answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 72
The thought that you will be talking to references and verifying the candidate‚Äôs answers compels the candidate to be much more truthful and complete than usual. You will be amazed how much of a truth serum this technique can be at this stage of the screening interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 73
Who were your last five bosses, and how will they each rate your performance on a 1‚Äì10 scale when we talk to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 75
about the answer by asking a follow-up question that begins with ‚ÄúWhat,‚Äù ‚ÄúHow,‚Äù or ‚ÄúTell me more.‚Äù Keep using this framework until you are clear about what the person is really saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 81
What Brad Smart discovered was the power of using data and patterns of behavior for making predictions about how somebody is likely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 81
perform in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 81
‚ÄúThe patterns become clearer and clearer,‚Äù he told us, ‚Äúso it becomes easy to get a fix on exactly what the individual‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses are today. It discloses the likelihood that a person will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 81
minimize weaker points. If the pattern is there of extracting success out of the jaws of defeat, that makes you want to hire somebody.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 83
This is where you will hear the stories behind the polished statements on a resume. In our experience, most&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 84
candidates naturally focus on what really mattered to them at that time in their career rather than regurgitate what they put on their resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 84
A Players tend to talk about outcomes linked to expectations. B and C Players talk generally about events, people they met, or aspects of the job they liked without ever getting into results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 84
Our recommendation is to reframe the question over and over until the candidate gets the message. ‚ÄúWhat went really wrong? What was your biggest mistake? What would you have done differently? What part of the job did you not like? In what ways were&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 84
your peers stronger than you?‚Äù Don‚Äôt let the candidate off the hook. Keep pushing until the candidate shares the lows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 85
Begin by asking candidates for their boss‚Äôs name. Ask them to spell it for you, and make a point to show them you are writing it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 85
‚ÄúJohn Smith, you say? That is S, M, I, T, H, right?‚Äù Forcing candidates to spell the name out no matter how common it might be sends a powerful message: you are going to call, so they should tell the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 85
Now ask, ‚ÄúWhat will Mr.¬†Smith say were your biggest strengths and areas for improvement?‚Äù Be sure to say will, not would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 88
A Players are highly valued by their bosses. B and C Players often are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 93
Thank you for taking the time to visit us today. As we have already discussed, we are going to do a chronological interview to walk through each job you have held. For each job I am going to ask you five core questions: What were you hired to do? What accomplishments are you most proud of? What were some low points during that job? Who were the people you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 93
worked with? Why did you leave that job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 94
At the end of the interview we will discuss your career goals and aspirations, and you will have a chance to ask me questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 94
Eighty percent of the process is in this room, but if we mutually decide to continue, we will conduct reference calls to complete the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 94
this sounds like a lengthy interview, it will go remarkably fast. I want to make sure you have the opportunity to share&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 94
your full story, so it is my job to guide the pace of the discussion. Sometimes, we‚Äôll go into more depth in a period of your career. Other times, I will ask that we move on to the next topic. I‚Äôll try to make sure we leave plenty of time to cover your&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 94
most recent, and frankly, most relevant jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 94
Setting expectations will put the candidate at ease and enable you to launch into the first chapter of his or her career with minimal confusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 95
You will have to interrupt the candidate at least once every three or four minutes, so get ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 95
The good way to interrupt somebody is to smile broadly, match their enthusiasm level, and use reflective listening to get them to stop talking without demoralizing them. You say, ‚ÄúWow! It sounds like that pig farm next to the corporate office smelled horrible!‚Äù The candidate nods and says ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù and appreciates your empathy and respect. Then you immediately say, ‚ÄúYou were just telling me about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 96
is through maintaining very high rapport that you get the most valuable data, and polite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 96
interrupting can build that rapport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 96
you can use to clarify how valuable an accomplishment was in any context. The questions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 96
How did your performance compare to the previous year‚Äôs performance? (For example, this person achieved sales of $2 million and the previous year‚Äôs sales were only $150,000.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 96
How did your performance compare to the plan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 96
How did your performance compare to that of peers? (For example, this person sold $2 million and was ranked first among thirty peers; the next-best performer sold only&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 97
People who perform well are generally pulled to greater opportunities. People who perform poorly are often pushed out of their jobs. Do not hire anybody who has been pushed out of 20 percent or more of their jobs. From our experience, those folks have a three times higher chance of being a chronic B or C Player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 97
Pull. ‚ÄúMy biggest client hired me.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy old boss recruited me to a bigger job.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe CEO asked me to take a double promotion.‚Äù ‚ÄúA former peer went to a competitor and referred me to his boss.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 101
As with all of the interviews we present in this book, get curious after every answer by using the ‚ÄúWhat? How? Tell me more‚Äù framework, and keep asking until you understand what the person did and how he or she did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 101
In addition, let‚Äôs say you have identified six competencies that define success in the job: 1. Aggressive 2. Persistent 3. Hires A Players 4. Holds people accountable 5. Follows through on commitments 6. Open to criticism and feedback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 103
Mike Ahearn, First Solar‚Äôs CEO, painted the big picture for us. ‚ÄúWe are a fast-moving, aggressive company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 103
They need to be results-oriented people who work toward continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 103
And they have to put safety first, build deep customer relationships, and recognize that people matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 107
‚ÄúWhat were the person‚Äôs biggest areas for improvement back then?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 109
answers. If you want to find out about a football team, the last person you talk to is the head coach. Don‚Äôt believe the coach. You talk to the players and the trainer and the managers.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 117
But he spent two hours of his time to save $10. So his need to win in that way makes him do stupid things. You should beware of candidates who need to win to an unhealthy extent because they will be battling you and your colleagues over petty things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118
‚ÄúStarting a sentence with ‚Äòno,‚Äô ‚Äòbut,‚Äô or ‚Äòhowever‚Äô during the interview process. ‚ÄòYes, that is a great idea‚Äô is the right answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118
‚ÄòNo, I agree with you but‚Äô is the symptom of somebody with an overactive ego who might be challenging to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118
‚ÄúMaking destructive comments about previous colleagues is a huge red flag. Because once this person works for you, he or she will make the same needless sarcastic comments about you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118
‚ÄúPassing the buck. Blaming is always bad. Winners don‚Äôt blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118
‚ÄúMaking excuses. Ask people what their challenges were. If they say that their biggest challenges were&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118
not their fault but other people‚Äôs fault, that shows they do not take responsibility for their performance.&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúThe excessive need to ‚Äòbe me.‚Äô Listen for comments like ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs just me, I‚Äôm not organized.‚Äô ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs just me, I‚Äôm impatient.‚Äô ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs just me, I don‚Äôt include other people in decisions. That‚Äôs just the way I am.‚Äô Beware. Somebody who has an excessive need to ‚Äòbe me‚Äô is telling you that they are not open to adapt their style to fit your culture or your company and&lt;/p&gt;

But wait, you are not finished. Have you heard the riddle about the five frogs on a log? It goes like this: Five frogs are on a log and one decides to jump off. How many are left? If you answered ‚Äúfive,‚Äù you are correct. Deciding to do something and actually doing it are two different things. You have decided who you should hire. Now it is time to take the final step: selling the person on actually joining your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
Conduct a Who Interview of one and a half to three hours by walking chronologically through a candidate‚Äôs career, using the same five questions for each job or chapter in the person‚Äôs work history. The hiring manager and one other colleague should conduct the interview in tandem. 3. FOCUSED INVERVIEW(S): Involve others in the hiring process by assigning team members to conduct interviews that focus on the outcomes and/or competencies on the scorecard. 4. CANDIDATE DISCUSSION: Following each day of interviews, grade the scorecard using the skill-will framework. Advance those whose skill (what they are fundamentally good at doing) and will (what they want to do, and in what type of culture) match the mission, outcomes, and competencies on your scorecard. Look for people whom you would rate an A on the critical outcomes and key competencies. Nobody is perfect, but seek those who are strong in the most important places of your scorecard. 5. REFERENCE INTERVIEW: Conduct seven reference calls with people you choose from the Who Interview. Ask the candidate to set up the calls to break through the gatekeepers while minimizing your own effort. 6. FINAL DECISION: Repeat your analysis of the skill-will profile to&lt;/p&gt;

Alec Gores uses this approach with every hire. ‚ÄúI tell them the vision and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 125
where we are heading, and they get excited,‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 125
‚ÄúThey have to understand my vision. They have to become part of the formula. We are all in the same boat. We make money the same way, and we go forward the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 125
‚ÄúShow that you are as concerned with the fit for them as you are in the fit for you. Ninety-nine percent of your competitors are not doing that. It is a key differentiator. You will be the one who cares enough to see if there is something for them here.&lt;/p&gt;

The challenge, Echavarr√≠a told us, is to walk them through the larger fit with company and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 126
‚ÄúOur corporate culture is low-key. It is a family company, not a public company. We have a high appreciation for values. We don‚Äôt like people who are too ostentatious or too self-sufficient. We are multinational, so we need people who can adapt to foreign cultures and our company culture.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúThis is hard. This is fun.‚Äù That‚Äôs the moment I knew I was changing mindsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 25
There was a saying in the 1960s that went: ‚ÄúBecoming is better than being.‚Äù The fixed mindset does not allow people the luxury of becoming. They have to already be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 27
But isn‚Äôt potential someone‚Äôs capacity to develop their skills with effort over time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 28
You cannot determine the slope of a line given only one point, as there is no line to begin with. A single point in time does not show trends, improvement, lack of effort, or mathematical ability‚Ä¶. ¬†&lt;/p&gt;

Marina Semyonova, the famed ballet teacher, who chose the students who were energized by criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 29
Until I discovered the mindsets and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 29
how they work, I, too, thought of myself as more talented than others, maybe even more worthy than others because of my endowments. The scariest thought, which I rarely entertained, was the possibility of being ordinary. This kind of thinking led me to need constant validation. Every comment, every look was meaningful‚Äîit registered on my intelligence scorecard, my attractiveness scorecard, my likability scorecard. If a day went well, I could bask in my high numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 32
People were praising me like I was a religious cult or something. That was very embarrassing. I‚Äôm a human being like everyone else.‚Äù Jordan knew how hard he had worked to develop his abilities.

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 32
The best pilots fly more than the others; that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre the best.‚Äù Like Michael Jordan, he was a human being. He just stretched himself farther than most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 32
who believe in fixed traits feel an urgency to succeed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 32
If you‚Äôre somebody when you‚Äôre successful, what are you when you‚Äôre unsuccessful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 32
MINDSETS CHANGE THE MEANING OF FAILURE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 33
As a New York Times article points out, failure has been transformed from an action (I failed) to an identity (I am a failure). This is especially true in the fixed mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 33
risk turning from a success into a failure? From a winner into a loser?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 33
Even in the growth mindset, failure can be a painful experience. But it doesn‚Äôt define you. It‚Äôs a problem to be faced, dealt with, and learned from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 34
Instead of letting the experience define him, he took control of it. He used it to become a better player and, he believes, a better person.&lt;/p&gt;

Around the publication of the 2003 Guide Michelin, however, Mr.¬†Loiseau committed suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 34
the idea of failure had possessed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 37
John Wooden, the legendary basketball coach, says you aren‚Äôt a failure until you start to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 39
When people believe their basic qualities can be developed, failures may still hurt, but failures don‚Äôt define them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 41
Malcolm Gladwell, the author and New Yorker writer, has suggested that as a society we value natural, effortless accomplishment over achievement through effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 44
For her, politics did not provide the personal creative effort she valued most,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 52
I‚Äôve always had a problem with confidence. My coaches always told me to believe in myself 100%. They told me not to let any doubts enter my mind and to think about how I‚Äôm better than everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 61
They were studying to learn, not just to ace the test.&lt;/p&gt;

take charge of the process to make sure it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 63
Most often people believe that the ‚Äúgift‚Äù is the ability itself. Yet what feeds it is that constant, endless curiosity and challenge seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 63
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so stupid. Adults like to think they‚Äôre in charge. Just say yes, and then eat your candy when you want to.‚Äù Were&lt;/p&gt;

Is everyone capable of great things with the right mindset?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 64
With the right mindset and the right teaching, people are capable of a lot more than we think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 64
With his growth mindset, he asked ‚ÄúHow can I teach them?‚Äù not ‚ÄúCan I teach them?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow will they learn best?‚Äù not ‚ÄúCan they learn?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 64
there‚Äôs a lot of intelligence out there being wasted by underestimating students‚Äô potential to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 67
The fixed mindset limits achievement. It fills people‚Äôs minds with interfering thoughts, it makes effort disagreeable, and it leads to inferior learning strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 67
What‚Äôs more, it makes other people into judges instead of allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 67
important achievements require a clear focus, all-out effort, and a bottomless trunk full of strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 68
people don‚Äôt understand the components‚Äîthe learnable components‚Äîof drawing. Actually, she informs us, they are not drawing skills at all, but seeing skills. They are the ability to perceive edges, spaces, relationships, lights and shadows, and the whole. Drawing requires us to learn each component skill and then combine them into one process. Some people simply pick up these skills in the natural course of their lives, whereas others have to work to learn them and put them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 70
she argues that creativity is not a magical act of inspiration. It‚Äôs the result of hard work and dedication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 72
In contrast, when students were praised for effort, 90 percent of them wanted the challenging new task that they could learn from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 72
Guettel echoes this. ‚ÄúIn my family, to be good is to fail. To be very good is to fail‚Ä¶. The only thing not a failure is to be great.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 72
Here‚Äôs Adam Guettel: ‚ÄúI wish I could just have fun and relax and not have the responsibility of that potential to be some kind of great man.‚Äù As with the kids in our study, the burden of talent was killing his enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 73
One thing is hopeful‚Äîhis recognition that he has his own life course to follow that is not dictated by other people and their view of his talent.&lt;/p&gt;

What‚Äôs so alarming is that we took ordinary children and made them into liars, simply by telling them they were smart.&lt;/p&gt;

Males say it to each other all the time. It may not be a kind thing to say, even in jest, but it certainly makes them think twice before buying into other people‚Äôs evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

It was inconceivable to him that you could have a goal and not take steps to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

It was gravy that his mind was so sharp and that he made up amusing poems, but we still think his greatness resided in his physique.&lt;/p&gt;

All of these people had character. None of them thought they were special people, born with the right to win. They were people who worked hard, who learned how to keep their focus under pressure, and who stretched beyond their ordinary abilities when they had to.&lt;/p&gt;

Those with the growth mindset found setbacks motivating. They‚Äôre informative. They‚Äôre a wake-up call.&lt;/p&gt;

We know from our studies that people with the fixed mindset do not admit and correct their deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

What he learned was this: True self-confidence is ‚Äúthe courage to be open‚Äîto welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source.‚Äù Real&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 127
self-confidence is not reflected in a title, an expensive suit, a fancy car, or a series of acquisitions. It is reflected in your mindset: your readiness to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 128
‚ÄúEventually I learned that I was really looking for people who were filled with passion and a desire to get things done. A resume didn‚Äôt tell me much about that inner hunger.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

Then he spread the word: This company is about growth, not self-importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 135
‚ÄúI take it we are all in complete agreement on the decision here‚Ä¶. Then I propose we postpone further discussion of this matter until our next meeting to give ourselves time to develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding of what the decision is all about.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 136
a growth mindset‚Äîby relieving people of the illusions or the burdens of fixed ability‚Äîleads to a full and open discussion of the information and to enhanced decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

We now have a workforce full of people who need constant reassurance and can‚Äôt take criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 137
If the wrong kinds of praise lead kids down the path of entitlement, dependence, and fragility, maybe the right kinds of praise can lead them down the path of hard work and greater hardiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 137
Instead of just giving employees an award for the smartest idea or praise for a brilliant performance, they would get praise for taking initiative, for seeing a difficult task through, for struggling and learning something new, for being undaunted by a setback, or for being open to and acting on criticism. Maybe it could be praise for not needing constant praise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 141
Presenting skills as learnable ‚ñ† Conveying that the organization values learning and perseverance, not just ready-made genius or talent&lt;/p&gt;

Giving feedback in a way that promotes learning and future success ‚ñ† Presenting managers as resources for learning&lt;/p&gt;

With a belief in development, such programs give meaning to the term ‚Äúhuman resources‚Äù and become a means of tapping enormous potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 141
Sadly, most managers and even CEOs become bosses, not leaders. They wield power instead of transforming themselves, their workers, and their organization.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a French expression: ‚ÄúTout comprendre c‚Äôest tout pardonner.‚Äù To understand all is to forgive all.&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm going to sit here and feel sorry for myself!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 148
The growth mindset says all of these things can be developed. All‚Äîyou, your partner, and the relationship‚Äîare capable of growth and change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 150
Aaron Beck, noted marriage authority, says that one of the most destructive beliefs for a relationship is ‚ÄúIf we need to work at it, there‚Äôs something seriously wrong with our relationship.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 152
with the fixed mindset is the belief that problems are a sign of deep-seated flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 152
But just as there are no great achievements without setbacks, there are no great relationships without conflicts and problems along the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 152
When people with a fixed mindset talk about their conflicts, they assign blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 152
Sometimes they blame themselves, but often they blame their partner. And they assign blame to a trait‚Äîa character flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 153
there. When people blame their partner‚Äôs personality for the problem, they feel anger and disgust toward them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 154
Relationship expert Daniel Wile says that choosing a partner is choosing a set of problems. There are no problem-free candidates. The trick is to acknowledge each other‚Äôs limitations, and build from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 155
It was a problem of communication, not a problem of personality or character. Yet in the fixed mindset, the blame came fast and furious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 155
In the end, this marriage was saved‚Äîonly because the couple learned to respond to each other not with angry labels, but with helpful actions. One day, when Karen was swamped with work, Ted came home to a messy house. He was angry and wanted to scold her, but, drawing on what he‚Äôd learned from Beck, he instead said to himself, ‚ÄúWhat is the mature thing to do?‚Äù He answered his own question by starting to clean things up. He was offering Karen support rather than judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 156
Aaron Beck tells couples in counseling never to think these fixed-mindset thoughts: My partner is incapable of change. Nothing can improve our relationship. These ideas, he says, are almost always wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 156
Bill was a permanently bad and untrustworthy husband or a man who needed a lot of help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 156
Yet Hillary could not have forgiven a person she saw as a liar and a cheat. She could only forgive a man she thought was earnestly struggling with his problems and trying to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 157
With the fixed mindset, one moment your partner is the light of your life, the next they‚Äôre your adversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 157
fact, in the fixed mindset you have a limited set of choices. One is to blame your own permanent qualities. And one is to blame your partner‚Äôs. You can see how tempting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 157
it is to foist the blame onto the other guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 157
and assign blame when something in a relationship goes wrong. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault!‚Äù To deal with this bad habit, my husband and I invented a third party, an imaginary man named Maurice. Whenever I start in on who‚Äôs to blame, we&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 157
invoke poor Maurice and pin it on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 158
relationship. The rest is not really relevant since I wasn‚Äôt seeking validation, but I‚Äôll tell you anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 158
What allowed me to take that first step, to choose growth and risk rejection? In the fixed mindset, I had needed my blame and bitterness. It made me feel more righteous, powerful, and whole than thinking I was at fault. The growth mindset allowed me to give up the blame and move on. The growth mindset gave me a mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 158
In a relationship, the growth mindset lets you rise above blame, understand the problem, and try to fix it‚Äîtogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 158
In the fixed mindset, where you‚Äôve got to keep proving your competence, it‚Äôs easy to get into a competition with your partner. Who‚Äôs the smarter, more talented, more likable one?&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúOh no,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúTo me the whole point of marriage is to encourage your partner‚Äôs development and have them encourage yours.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

Beer found, first, that people with the fixed mindset were more likely to be shy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 163
This makes sense. The fixed mindset makes you concerned about judgment, and this can make you more self-conscious and anxious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 163
Shyness harmed the social interactions of people with the fixed mindset but did not harm the social relations of people with the growth mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 164
shy growth-mindset people take control of their shyness. They go out and meet new people, and, after their nerves settle down, their relationships proceed normally. The shyness doesn‚Äôt tyrannize them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 167
In our study, the students with the growth mindset were not as prone to see the bullying as a reflection of who they were. Instead, they saw it as a psychological problem of the bullies, a way for the bullies to gain status or charge their self-esteem: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd think that the reason he is bothering me is probably that he has problems at home or at school with his grades.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 168
would want to forgive them eventually‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy number one goal would be to help them become better people.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 168
‚ÄúPeople do have the potential to change.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 169
Bullies judge. Victims take it in. Sometimes it remains inside and can lead to depression and suicide. Sometimes it explodes into violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 170
What Davis does is this. First, while enforcing consistent discipline, he doesn‚Äôt judge the bully as a person. No criticism is directed at traits. Instead, he makes them feel liked and welcome at school every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 170
direction. But again, he does not praise the person; he praises their effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 170
notice that you have been staying out of fights. That tells me you are working on getting along with people.‚Äù You can see that Davis is leading students directly to the growth mindset. He is helping them see their actions as part of an effort to improve. Even if the change was not intentional on the part of the bullies, they may now try to make it so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 171
but hopeful of forgiving, learning, and moving on? Think of the worst rejection you ever had. Get in touch with all the feelings, and see if you can view it from a growth mindset. What did you learn from it? Did it teach you something about what you want and don‚Äôt want in your life? Did it teach you some positive things that were useful in later relationships? Can you forgive that person and wish them well? Can you let go of the bitterness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 172
Problems can be a vehicle for developing greater understanding and intimacy. Allow your partner to air his or her differences, listen carefully, and discuss them in a patient and caring manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 172
Are you a blamer like me? It‚Äôs not good for a relationship to pin everything on your partner. Create your own Maurice and blame him instead. Better yet, work toward curing yourself of the need to blame. Move beyond thinking about fault and blame all the time. Think of me trying to do that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 172
Are you shy? Then you really need the growth mindset. Even if it doesn‚Äôt cure your shyness, it will help keep it from messing up your social interactions. Next time you‚Äôre venturing into a social situation, think about these things: how social skills are things you can improve and how social interactions are for learning and enjoyment, not judgment. Keep practicing this.&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúI would do anything, give anything, to make my children successful.‚Äù Yet many of the things they do boomerang. Their helpful judgments, their lessons, their motivating techniques often send the wrong message.&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre brilliant!‚Äù Needless to say, I was appalled at what I had done, and as the look of horror spread over my face, he rushed to reassure me. ‚ÄúI know you meant it in the most ‚Äògrowth-minded‚Äô way.

(This may be especially important for children with learning disabilities. Often for them it is not sheer effort that works but finding the right strategy.)&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúPraise should deal, not with the child‚Äôs personality attributes, but with his efforts and achievements.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 178
Sometimes people are careful to use growth-oriented praise with their children but then ruin it by the way they talk about others.&lt;/p&gt;

When children hear their parents level fixed judgments at others, it communicates a fixed mindset. And they have to wonder, Am I next?&lt;/p&gt;

There are some people who are born smart in math and everything is easy for them. Then there are the rest of you. For the other half of the students, we talked about the mathematicians as people who became passionate about math and ended up making great discoveries. This brought students into a growth mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 179
Skills and achievement come through commitment and effort.&lt;/p&gt;

The night before each test, her parents, seeing how distraught she was, tried to build her confidence. ‚ÄúLook, you know how smart you are and we know how smart you are. You‚Äôve got this nailed. Now, stop worrying.‚Äù They were as supportive as they knew how to be, but they were raising the stakes even higher. What could they have said instead? ‚ÄúIt must be a terrible thing to feel that everyone is evaluating you and you can‚Äôt show what you know. We want you to know that we are not evaluating you. We care about your learning, and we know that you‚Äôve learned your stuff. We‚Äôre proud that you‚Äôve stuck to it and kept learning.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 180

Children as young as toddlers pick up these messages from their parents, learning that their mistakes are worthy of judgment and punishment. Or learning that their mistakes are an occasion for suggestions and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 186

As more and more students wanted a part of this mindset and as she ‚Äúwasted‚Äù more and more of her time on these efforts,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 197
he found something fascinating. For most of them, their first teachers were incredibly warm and accepting. Not that they set low standards. Not at all, but they created an atmosphere of trust, not judgment. It was, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to teach you,‚Äù not ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to judge your talent.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 201
One of Marva Collins‚Äôs first mentors taught her the same thing‚Äîthat, above all, a good teacher is one who continues to learn along with the students. And she let her students know that right up front: ‚ÄúSometimes I don‚Äôt like other grown-ups very much because they think they know everything. I don‚Äôt know everything. I can learn all the time.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 202
The fixed mindset makes people complicated. It makes them worried about their fixed traits and creates the need to document them, sometimes at your expense. And it makes them judgmental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 227
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to dispute your decision. I just want to know, if I decide to apply again in the future, how I can improve my application. I would be very grateful if you could give me some feedback along those lines.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

Think of something you need to do, something you want to learn, or a problem you have to confront. What is it? Now make a concrete plan. When will you follow through on your plan? Where will you do it? How will you do it? Think about it in vivid detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 228
These concrete plans‚Äîplans you can visualize‚Äîabout when, where, and how you are going to do something lead to really high levels of follow-through, which, of course, ups the chances of success. So the idea is not only to make a growth-mindset plan, but also to visualize, in a concrete way, how you‚Äôre going to carry it out.&lt;/p&gt;

The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man. ‚ÄîGEORGE BERNARD SHAW, Maxims for Revolutionists SPRING 2005 / PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY I HAD TO bribe them.&lt;/p&gt;

Doing the Unrealistic Is Easier Than Doing the Realistic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 943
If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 945
Having an unusually large goal is an adrenaline infusion that provides the endurance to overcome the inevitable trials and tribulations that go along with any goal. Realistic goals, goals restricted to the average ambition level, are uninspiring and will only fuel you through the first or second problem,&lt;/p&gt;

No more changing hotels midtrip to avoid noise. AND, I know we have to travel light, but with baby a lot of things are nonnegotiable. These make for smoother sailing: (1) Peanut shell sling in black fleece‚Äîit‚Äôs more comfy than the cotton and you can pop baby in and out wherever you are, from birth to 35 lbs.

Make sure the wheeled carry-on bag you get is one size smaller than the allowed carry-on size so you don‚Äôt get bumped to check the bag in if the plane is full. You can always nicely argue/reason/bat your eyelashes that you will put the bag in your foot space. Also, very helpful to give baby something to sip or munch on during takeoff and landing so yours isn‚Äôt the baby screaming from ear pain. Happy travels!&lt;/p&gt;

WHAT YOU TRACK DETERMINES YOUR LENS‚ÄîCHOOSE CAREFULLY ‚ÄúThose of us who are lucky enough to live in a world where we have enough and we have a roof and we have food‚Äîwe find ourselves caught in this cycle of keeping track of the wrong things. Keeping track of how many times we‚Äôve been rejected. Keeping track of how many times it didn‚Äôt work. Keeping track of all the times someone has broken our heart or double-crossed us or let us down. Of course, we can keep track of those things, but why? Why keep track of them? Are they making us better? ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to keep track of the other stuff? To keep track of all the times it worked? All the times we took a risk? All the times we were able to brighten someone else‚Äôs day? When we start doing that, we can redefine ourselves as people who are able to make an impact on the world. It took me a bunch of cycles to figure out that the narrative was up to me. ‚ÄúIf a narrative isn‚Äôt working, well then, really, why are you using it?

When poets fall in love, they make a list of their loved one‚Äôs body parts and attach similes to them. Your lips are like cherries, your hair is like gold, and your eyes are like traffic lights that make my heart stop and go.&lt;/p&gt;

The reason for Tolkien‚Äôs mistake, since you ask, is that adjectives in English absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that word order in the slightest you‚Äôll sound like a maniac. It‚Äôs an odd thing that every English speaker uses that list, but almost none of us could write it out. And as size comes before colour, green great dragons can‚Äôt exist.&lt;/p&gt;

Once you change your philosophy, you change your thought pattern. Once you change your thought pattern, you change your attitude. Once you change your attitude, it changes your behavior pattern and then you go on into some action.&lt;/p&gt;

Finally, out of desperation, I went as small as I could possibly go and asked: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the ONE Thing you can do this week such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?‚Äù And the most awesome thing happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 87
Where I‚Äôd had huge success, I had narrowed my concentration to one thing, and where my success varied, my focus had too. And the light came on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 95
extraordinary results are directly determined by how narrow you can make your focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 134
Getting extraordinary results is all about creating a domino effect in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 145
The key is over time. Success is built sequentially. It‚Äôs one thing at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

Amorico, Italy‚Äôs most successful tour guide, says he developed his skills and ultimately his business from his singular passion for his country and the deep desire to share it with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 308
When everything feels urgent and important, everything seems equal. We become active and busy, but this doesn‚Äôt actually move us any closer to success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 309
often unrelated to productivity, and busyness rarely takes care of business.&lt;/p&gt;

Knocking out a hundred tasks for whatever the reason is a poor substitute for doing even one task that‚Äôs meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 325
Achievers do sooner what others plan to do later and defer, perhaps indefinitely, what others do sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 331
Instead of a to-do list, you need a success list‚Äîa list that is purposefully created around extraordinary results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 332
To-do lists tend to be long; success lists are short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 355
‚ÄúThe 80/20 Principle asserts that a minority of causes, inputs, or effort usually lead to a majority of the results, outputs, or rewards.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 361
the majority of what you want will come from the minority of what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 365
Juran‚Äôs great insight was that not everything matters equally; some things matter more than others‚Äîa lot more. A to-do list becomes a success list when you apply Pareto‚Äôs Principle to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 368
A few ideas gave me most of my results.&lt;/p&gt;

No matter how many to-dos you start with, you can always narrow it to one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 403
focus on being productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 405
Once you‚Äôve figured out what actually matters, keep asking what matters most until there is only one thing left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 411
The truth is that things don‚Äôt matter equally and success is found in doing what matters most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 436
‚ÄúMultitasking is merely the opportunity to screw up more than one thing at a time.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 452
It‚Äôs not that we have too little time to do all the things we need to do, it‚Äôs that we feel the need to do too many things in the time we have. So we double and triple up in the hope of getting everything done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 464
With an average of 4,000 thoughts a day flying in and out of our heads, it‚Äôs easy to see why we try to multitask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 472
It‚Äôs what researchers refer to as ‚Äútask switching.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 476
relative complexity of those tasks makes it impossible to easily jump back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 540
When you try to do too much at once, you can end up doing nothing well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 553
Success is actually a short race‚Äîa sprint fueled by discipline just long enough for habit to kick in and take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 557
When you discipline yourself, you‚Äôre essentially training yourself to act in a specific way. Stay with this long enough and it becomes routine‚Äîin other words, a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 563
You don‚Äôt need to be a disciplined person to be successful. In fact, you can become successful with less discipline than you think, for one simple reason: success is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 565
The trick to success is to choose the right habit and bring just enough discipline to establish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 583
What sometimes gets overlooked, however, is an amazing windfall: it also simplifies your life. Your life gets clearer and less complicated because you know what you have to do well and you know what you don‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 585
When you do the right thing, it can liberate you from having to monitor everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 593
The hard stuff becomes habit, and habit makes the hard stuff easy.&lt;/p&gt;

Be a person of powerful habits and use selected discipline to develop them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 716
And if you‚Äôre not careful, your default settings may convict you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 717
When our willpower runs out, we all revert to our default settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 740
Every day, without realizing it, we engage in all manner of activities that diminish our willpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 747
do your most important work‚Äîyour ONE Thing‚Äîearly, before your willpower is drawn down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 772
Purpose, meaning, significance‚Äîthese are what make a successful life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 774
The act of living a full life by giving time to what matters is a balancing act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 774
Extraordinary results require focused attention and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 778
Jared Diamond‚Äôs Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies illustrates how farm-based societies that generated a surplus of food ultimately gave rise to professional specialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 802
Knowing when to pursue the middle and when to pursue the extremes is in essence the true beginning of wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 806
The reason we shouldn‚Äôt pursue balance is that the magic never happens in the middle; magic happens at the extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 856
the key ingredient is focused time over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 856
To achieve an extraordinary result you must choose what matters most and give it all the time it demands. This requires getting extremely out of balance in relation to all other work issues, with only infrequent counterbalancing to address them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 861
Your personal life requires tight counterbalancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 884
divided into two distinct areas‚Äîwhat matters most and everything else. You will have to take what matters to the extremes and be okay with what happens to the rest. Professional success requires&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 924
Believing in big frees you to ask different questions, follow different paths, and try new things. This opens the doors to possibilities that until now only lived inside you.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr.¬†Martin Seligman, past president of the American Psychological Association, believes there are five factors that contribute to our happiness: positive emotion and pleasure, achievement, relationships, engagement, and meaning. Of these, he believes engagement and meaning are the most important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,452
When our daily actions fulfill a bigger purpose, the most powerful and enduring happiness can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,458
My response is, ‚ÄúIt is, and it isn‚Äôt. It all depends on what you‚Äôd do with it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,478
Live with purpose and don‚Äôt be surprised if you actually hum more and even whistle while you work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,483
The surest path to achieving lasting happiness happens when you make your life about something bigger, when you bring meaning and purpose to your everyday actions.&lt;/p&gt;

It‚Äôs an ordinary occurrence, oddly named hyperbolic discounting‚Äîthe farther away a reward is in the future, the smaller the immediate motivation to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,569
Researchers call this the ‚Äúplanning fallacy.‚Äù Visualizing the process‚Äîbreaking a big goal down into the steps needed to achieve it‚Äîhelps engage the strategic thinking you need to plan for and achieve extraordinary results. This is why Goal Setting to the Now really works.&lt;/p&gt;

Time blocking is a very results-oriented way of viewing and using time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,639
Time blocking harnesses your energy and centers it on your most important work. It‚Äôs productivity‚Äôs greatest power tool.&lt;/p&gt;

In truth, the most successful simply see themselves as working between vacations. On the other hand, the least successful don‚Äôt reserve time off, because they don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll deserve it or be able to afford it.&lt;/p&gt;

There is nothing more important to true growth than realizing that you are not the voice of the mind‚Äîyou are the one who hears it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 10
The truth is that most of life will unfold in accordance with forces far outside your control, regardless of what your mind says about it.&lt;/p&gt;

They are simply making you feel better or worse about what is going on now, what has gone on in the past, or what might go on in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 10
there is no reason to constantly attempt to figure everything out. Eventually you will see that the real cause of problems is not life itself. It‚Äôs the commotion the mind makes about life that really causes problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 12
What you end up experiencing is really a personal presentation of the world according to you, rather than the stark, unfiltered experience of what is really out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 12
Your consciousness is actually experiencing your mental model of reality, not reality itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 12
If you can‚Äôt get the world the way you like it, you internally verbalize it, judge it, complain about it, and then decide what to do about&lt;/p&gt;

If you decide not to narrate and, instead, just consciously observe the world, you will feel more open and exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

You will come to see that the mind talks all the time because you gave it a job to do. You use it as a protection mechanism, a form of defense.&lt;/p&gt;

True personal growth is about transcending the part of you that is not okay and needs protection.&lt;/p&gt;

a change from ‚Äúouter solution consciousness‚Äù to ‚Äúinner solution consciousness.‚Äù You have to break the habit of thinking that the solution to your problems is to rearrange things outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 22
yourself. You will eventually catch on that you have to distance yourself from your psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 22
There is nothing you can‚Äôt do. Your will is supreme over all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 22
You do this as though your life depended on it, because it does. As it is right now, your life is not your own; it belongs to your inner roommate, the psyche. You have to take it back. Stand firm in the seat of the witness and release the hold that the habitual mind has on you. This is your life‚Äîreclaim it.&lt;/p&gt;

1As explicated by the Buddha in the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra (trans. Kosho Yamamoto 1973). 2Atman: Hinduism - The innermost essence of each individual (Merriam-Webster 2003).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:book&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 35
As scary as it sounds, that is your predicament in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 35
Unless you‚Äôre fully seated in witness consciousness, you‚Äôre not back there being aware that you‚Äôre the one watching all this. That is what it means to be lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 45
You could actually be in the habit of experiencing an uptight, closing sensation whenever somebody walks up to you. You can train yourself to do the opposite. You can train yourself to open every time you see a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 46
What you‚Äôll find is that the only thing you really want from life is to feel enthusiasm, joy, and love. If you can feel that all the time, then who cares what happens outside?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 46
if you can always feel excited about the experience of the moment, then it doesn‚Äôt make any difference what the experience is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 46
So you learn to stay open no matter what happens. If you do, you get for free what everybody else is struggling for: love, enthusiasm, excitement, and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 46
Do not let anything that happens in life be important enough that you‚Äôre willing to close your heart over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 46
say, ‚ÄúNo.¬†I‚Äôm not going to close. I‚Äôm going to relax. I‚Äôm going to let this situation take place and be there with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 46
No matter what anyone does, no matter what situation takes place, you won‚Äôt even feel the tendency to close. You will just embrace life with all your heart and soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 48
As long as you are defining what you like and what you don‚Äôt like, you will open and close. You are actually defining your limits. You are allowing your mind to create triggers that open and close you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 48
Let go of that. Dare to be different. Enjoy all of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 52
Life must now compete with this blocked event for your attention, and the impression does not just sit in there quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 53
In the yogic tradition, that unfinished energy pattern is called a Samskara. This is a Sanskrit word meaning ‚Äúimpression,‚Äù and in the yogic teachings it is considered one of the most important influences affecting your life. A Samskara is a blockage, an impression from the past. It‚Äôs an unfinished energy pattern that ends up running your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 57
The alternative is to be willing to let it go when it gets stimulated. It only hurts for a minute and then it‚Äôs over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 60
Because most of us don‚Äôt have to worry about food, clothing, or shelter, we have the luxury of worrying about a spot on our pants, or laughing too loud, or saying something wrong. Because we‚Äôve developed this hypersensitive psyche, we constantly use our energies to close around it and protect ourselves. But this process only hides the problems; it doesn‚Äôt fix them. You‚Äôre locking your illness inside yourself,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 61
if you protect yourself, you will never be free. It‚Äôs that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 62
Once you close, you have to make sure that what you protected doesn‚Äôt get disturbed. You then carry this task for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 62
day. How often do you find yourself trying to protect and defend that weak part of you? You feel like the world wants to get right at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 62
The reward for not protecting your psyche is liberation. You are free to walk through this world without a problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 62
You are just having fun experiencing whatever happens next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 62
disturbed. You no longer have to listen to ‚ÄúWhat will they think of me?‚Äù or, ‚ÄúOh God, I wish I hadn‚Äôt said that. It sounded so stupid.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 62
Spiritual growth is about the point at which you start to feel your energy change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 62
For instance, somebody says something, and you start to feel the energy get a little strange inside. You will actually start to feel a tightening. That is your cue that it‚Äôs time to grow. It‚Äôs not time to defend yourself, because you don‚Äôt want the part of you that you would be defending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 64
This technique of freeing yourself is done with the understanding that thoughts and emotions are just objects of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 64
consciousness. If you want to be free, then every time you feel any change in the energy flow, relax behind it. Don‚Äôt fight with it, don‚Äôt try to change it, and don‚Äôt judge it. Don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúOh, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm still feeling this. I promised myself I wouldn‚Äôt think about that car anymore.‚Äù Don‚Äôt do that; you‚Äôll just end up going with the guilt thoughts instead of the car thoughts. You have to let them all go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 65
Only you can take inner freedom away from yourself, or give it to yourself. Nobody else can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 71
If you have a lot of fear, you won‚Äôt like change. You‚Äôll try to create a world around you that is predictable, controllable, and definable. You‚Äôll try to create a world that doesn‚Äôt stimulate your fears. Fear doesn‚Äôt want to feel itself; it‚Äôs actually afraid of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 71
You can do one of two things with fear: you can recognize that you have it and work to release it, or you can keep it and try to hide from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 72
Your definitions of desirable and undesirable, as well as good and bad, all come about because you have defined how things need to be in order for you to be okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 72
As you grow spiritually, you will realize that your attempts to protect yourself from your problems actually create more problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 73
When your heart is weak it becomes susceptible to lower vibrations, and one of the lowest of all vibrations is fear. Fear is the cause of every problem. It‚Äôs the root of all prejudices and the negative emotions of anger, jealousy, and possessiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 73
You‚Äôd be willing to face everything and everyone because you wouldn‚Äôt have fear inside of you that could cause you disturbance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 73
The purpose of spiritual evolution is to remove the blockages that cause your fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 74
Everyone is saying, ‚ÄúI will do every single thing I can to keep my stuff. If you say anything that disturbs me, I will defend myself. I‚Äôll yell at you and make you take it back. If you cause any disturbance inside of me, I will make you so sorry.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 74
again. First you defend yourself, and then you protect yourself. You do whatever you can to keep from feeling disturbance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 74
You only have to be willing to open your heart in the face of anything and everything, and permit the purification process to take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 76
Your consciousness leaves the centered position of witnessing the many energies around you, and you get sucked into focusing on just one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 76
Things you liked, now look dark and depressing. But nothing has really changed. It‚Äôs just that you‚Äôre looking at life from that seat of disturbance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 80
So don‚Äôt fall. Let go. No matter what it is, let it go. The bigger it is, the higher the reward of letting go and the worse the fall if you don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs pretty black-and-white. You either let go or you don‚Äôt. There really isn‚Äôt anything in between. So let all of your blockages and disturbances become the fuel for the journey. That which is holding you down can become a powerful force&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 81
Real transformation begins when you embrace your problems as agents for growth. In order to understand how this process works, let‚Äôs examine the following situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 88
This is what you begin to experience if you hang out with the Self instead of hanging out with inner disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 88
Awareness is simply aware while everything in the universe parades before it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 89
When Buddha said that all of life is suffering, this is what he was referring to. People do not understand how much they are suffering because they have never experienced what it is like to not suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 90
You are either trying to stop suffering, controlling your environment to avoid suffering, or worrying about suffering in the future. This state of affairs is so prevalent that you don‚Äôt see it, just as a fish doesn‚Äôt see the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 91
Inner sensitivity is a symptom of non-well-being. It‚Äôs the same as when the body sends pain or displays other symptoms when it‚Äôs not well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 91
Your psyche is communicating through its universal language: fear. Self-consciousness, jealousy, insecurity, anxiety‚Äîthey are all fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 92
What you‚Äôll see is that your mind is always telling you that you have to change something outside in order to solve your inner problems. But if you are wise, you won‚Äôt play this game. You‚Äôll realize that the advice your mind is giving you is psychologically damaged advice. Your mind‚Äôs thoughts are disturbed by its fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 93
The fact is, however, external changes are not going to solve your problem because they don‚Äôt address the root of your problem. The root problem is that you don‚Äôt feel whole and complete within yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 93
You began with a problem inside yourself, and you tried to solve it by getting involved with somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 93
Imagine what fun life would be if you didn‚Äôt have those neurotic, personal thoughts going on within you. You could enjoy things, and you could actually get to know people instead of needing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 93
You could just live and experience your life, instead of trying to use life to fix what‚Äôs wrong inside of you. You are capable of achieving that state. It‚Äôs never too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 95
your mind starts telling you what you have to do to make everything inside okay, don‚Äôt buy into what it‚Äôs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 95
The truth is, everything will be okay as soon as you are okay with everything. And that‚Äôs the only time everything will be okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 96
There are billions of people on this planet, and one of them didn‚Äôt say hello to you. Are you saying that you can‚Äôt handle that? Is that reasonable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 96
Begin this journey to freedom by regularly reminding yourself to watch the psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 97
Every time you get into your car, as you‚Äôre settling into the seat, just stop. Take a moment to remember that you‚Äôre spinning on a planet in the middle of empty space. Then remind yourself that you‚Äôre not going to get involved in your own melodrama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 97
Persistently centered consciousness is the seat of Self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 98
by untethering yourself from the bondage of your psyche,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 98
This freedom is so great it has been given a special name‚Äîliberation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 101
heart. What is that feeling? Why is that happening? People don‚Äôt normally ask why; they just try to keep it from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 101
You must go deeper than that and look at the dynamics of the layers that have been created. At the core there is the pain. Then, in order to avoid the pain, you try to stay busy with friends and hide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 102
sky. You are sitting on a planet spinning around in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Though you can only see a few thousand stars, there are hundreds of billions of stars in our Milky Way Galaxy alone. In fact, it is estimated that there are over a trillion stars in the Spiral Galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 102
From that perspective, do you really care what people think about your clothes or your car? Do you really need to feel embarrassed if you forget someone‚Äôs name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 102
To spend your life avoiding pain means it‚Äôs always right behind you. At any point you could slip and say the wrong thing. At any point anything can happen. So you end up devoting your life to the avoidance of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 103
In essence, you can simply live your life and experience what it‚Äôs like to be on a planet that is spinning around in the middle of nowhere, until you die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 103
If you want to be free, simply view inner pain as a temporary shift in your energy flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 103
You cannot spend your life avoiding things that are not actually happening, or everything will become negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 103
Probably more than there are stars in the sky. If you want to grow and be free to explore life, you cannot spend your life avoiding the myriad things that might hurt your heart or mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 103
You must look inside yourself and determine that from now on pain is not a problem. It is just a thing in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 103
with it, you will devote your life to avoiding it. If you feel insecurity, it‚Äôs just a feeling. You can handle a feeling. If you feel embarrassed, it‚Äôs just a feeling. It‚Äôs just a part of creation. If you feel jealousy and your heart burns, just look at it objectively, like you would a mild bruise. It‚Äôs a thing in the universe that is passing through your system. Laugh at it, have fun with it, but don‚Äôt be afraid of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 103
it. It cannot touch you unless you touch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 104
Wise beings do not want to remain a slave to the fear of pain. They permit the world to be what it is instead of being afraid of it. They wholeheartedly participate in life, but not for the purpose of using life to avoid themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 104
let it pass through you like the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 105
Just start seeing these inner experiences as energy passing through your heart and before the eye of your consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 105
relax. Do the opposite of contracting and closing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 106
If you have any wisdom, you will leave it alone and not try to change your life to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 106
you. If you do not care, if you are no longer afraid of yourself, you are free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 106
You will feel everything at a deeper level. You will begin to have truly beautiful experiences rise up within you. Eventually you will understand that there is an ocean of love behind all of this fear and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 112
Imagine that you found yourself in the midst of an open field where the sun was always shining. It was a beautiful place of great light and great openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:Great analogy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 116
It‚Äôs not really difficult to get past the walls. Time and again, every day, the natural flow of life collides with our walls and tries to tear them down. But time and again, we defend them. You must realize that when you defend yourself, you are really defending your walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 120
Since the analytical mind cannot handle the infinite, you created an alternate reality of finite thoughts that can remain fixed within your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 120
This mental model has become your reality. You must now struggle day and night to make the world fit your model, and you label everything that doesn‚Äôt fit as wrong, bad, or unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 120
You get frustrated and angry over simple little things. This is the result of being unable to fit what‚Äôs actually happening into your model of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 120
In order to truly go beyond your model, you must first understand why you built it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 121
If you really want to see why you do things, then don‚Äôt do them and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:interesting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 121
The moment somebody starts behaving in a way that is outside your expectations, your mind starts talking. It says, ‚ÄúWhat should I do about this? I can‚Äôt just ignore what he did. I could confront him directly or ask someone else to talk to him.‚Äù Your mind is telling you to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:fix it in order to fit into your model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
This zone is finite. All attempts to stay within it keep you finite. Going beyond always means letting go of the effort to keep things within your defined limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
In other words, you can devote your whole life to the process of making sure everything fits within your limited model, or you can devote your life to freeing yourself from the limits of your model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
But in truth, the confines of your comfort zone create just such a cage. This inner cage doesn‚Äôt limit your body; it limits the expanse of your consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
If you examine this, you will see that you‚Äôre willing to stay in this cage because you‚Äôre afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
They don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúGet me out of here! I‚Äôm locked in this tiny world in which everything has to be a certain way. I have to worry about what everybody‚Äôs doing, what I look like, and everything I‚Äôve ever said. I want out.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 123
You see that you‚Äôre afraid to tell people what you really think. You see that you‚Äôre too self-conscious to freely express yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 124
Spirituality begins when you decide that you‚Äôll never stop trying. Spirituality is the commitment to go beyond,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 126
The day unfolds and the mind doesn‚Äôt say anything. You simply interact with the day with a peaceful, fully inspired heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 129
on. The more consciousness narrows its focus onto this mental structure, the greater the tendency to utilize it to define the concept of self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 130
Who are you that is lost and trying to build a concept of yourself in order to be found?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:why design a concept of self?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 130
You will never find yourself in what you have built to define yourself. You‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs doing the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 130
In this panic, in this lost state, you learned to cling and hold onto the thoughts and emotions that were passing before you. You used them to build a personality, a persona, a self-concept that would allow you to define yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 131
If you get that model down absolutely right, and behave consistently every time, you have actually ‚Äúcreated‚Äù someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 131
It got engrained in you at a very young age,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 134
the events that happen in the moment belong to the moment. They don‚Äôt belong to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 135
When your mind is disturbed, don‚Äôt ask, ‚ÄúWhat do I do about this?‚Äù Instead ask, ‚ÄúWho am I that notices this?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 136
aware. If you pass through a period of darkness or depression, just ask, ‚ÄúWho is aware of the darkness?‚Äù That‚Äôs how you pass through the different stages of your inner growth. You just keep letting go, and remain aware that you are still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 136
When you‚Äôve let go of the dark psyche, and you‚Äôve let go of the light psyche, and you‚Äôre no longer clinging to anything, you will reach a point where it will all open up behind you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 136
You will then walk through every moment of your daily life with the flow of this inner force sustaining you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 136
You will still have thoughts, emotions, and a self-concept floating around in inner space, but they will be just one small part of what you experience. You will not identify with anything outside the sense of Self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 143
Events don‚Äôt determine whether or not you‚Äôre going to be happy. They‚Äôre just events. You determine whether or not you‚Äôre going to be happy. You can be happy just to be alive. You can be happy having all these things happen to you, and then be happy to die. If you can live this way, your heart will be so open and your Spirit will be so free, that you will soar up to the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 143
You‚Äôre sitting on a planet spinning around in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Go ahead, take a look at reality. You‚Äôre floating in empty space in a universe that goes on forever. If you have to be here, at least be happy and enjoy the experience. You‚Äôre going to die anyway. Things are going to happen anyway. Why shouldn‚Äôt you be happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 144
Every time a part of you begins to get unhappy, let it go. Work with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 145
The technique of unconditional happiness is ideal because what you‚Äôre doing with the rest of your life is already defined‚Äîyou‚Äôre letting go of yourself so that you can remain happy. As far as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 146
your spirituality goes, you‚Äôre going to grow very rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 146
They‚Äôre also going to notice the purification of their mind because they are not getting involved in the mind‚Äôs melodrama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 148
Everything I look at just creates waves of joy inside me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 148
God in the yogic tradition is Satchitananda‚ÄîEternal, Conscious Bliss. God is ecstasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 149
If you‚Äôre neither pushing life away, nor pulling it toward you, then you are not creating any resistance. You are simply present. In this state, you are just witnessing and experiencing the events of life taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 150
your being. It is what makes your arms and legs move. They don‚Äôt just move randomly by themselves. They move the way they do because you assert will to make them do so. You use the same will to hold onto thoughts when you want to concentrate on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 151
Eventually you‚Äôll see that this resistance is a tremendous waste of energy. The fact is, you‚Äôre generally using your will to resist one of two things: that which has already happened or that which hasn‚Äôt happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 151
It is not life‚Äôs events that are causing problems or stress. It is your resistance to life‚Äôs events that is causing this experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 152
This is because we don‚Äôt all have the same preconceived notions of how things should be or how much they should matter to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 152
If you want to understand stress, begin by realizing that you carry around with you your own set of preconceived notions of how things should be. It is based upon these notions that you assert your will to resist what has already happened. Where did you get these preconceived notions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 153
begin dealing with each situation with acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 153
This is because events are not problems; they‚Äôre just events. Your resistance to them is what causes the problem. But, again, don‚Äôt think that because you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 153
You will be surprised to find that in most situations there‚Äôs nothing to deal with except for your own fears and desires. Fear and desire make everything seem so complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 153
When the events of this world make it through you, you have reached a deep spiritual state. You can then be conscious in the presence of whatever takes place, without building up blocked energies. When you attain that state, everything becomes clear. In contrast, everybody else is attempting to deal with the world around them while struggling with their own reactions and personal preferences. When a person is dealing with their own fears, anxieties, and desires, how much energy is left for dealing with what‚Äôs actually happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 154
Stop and think about what you‚Äôre capable of achieving. Up to now, your capacities have been constrained by constant inner struggles. Imagine what would happen if your awareness was free to focus only on the events actually taking place. You would have no noise going on inside. If you lived like this, you could do anything. Your capabilities would be exponential compared to what you‚Äôve ever experienced. If you could bring this level of awareness and clarity to everything you do, your life would change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 154
If you‚Äôre not trying to make people fit into your preconceived notions of what you like and dislike, you will find that relationships are not really that difficult. If you‚Äôre not so busy judging and resisting people based upon what is blocked inside of you, you will find that they are much easier to get along with‚Äîand so are you.&lt;/p&gt;

Daily work is fun. In fact, it‚Äôs easy. Your work is just what you do with yourself during the day while you‚Äôre spinning on a planet through empty space. If&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 154
Once the personal energies pass through you, the world becomes a different place. People and events will appear different to you. You will realize that you have talents and abilities you never saw before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 156
This process of relaxing through resistance is beneficial to everything in your life. This is because it directly addresses how to keep your heart open when it is trying to close. Deep inner release is a spiritual path in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 156
It‚Äôs the work of a lifetime to become that open, that complete, and that whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 156
If you relax and release, you will see that it puts you through tremendous spiritual growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 156
You truly can reach a state in which you never have any more stress, tension, or problems for the rest of your life. You just have to realize that life is giving you a gift, and that gift is the flow of events that takes place between your birth and your death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 156
Learn to stop resisting reality, and what used to look like stressful problems will begin to look like the stepping-stones of your spiritual journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 161
The true seeker commits to live like that every moment and lets nothing stop them. Why should anything stop you? You‚Äôre just going to die anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 161
You have to understand that it is your attempt to get special experiences from life that makes you miss the actual experience of life. Life is not something you get; it‚Äôs something you experience. Life exists with or without you. It has been going on for billions of years. You simply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 162
You fear death because you crave life. You fear death because you think there‚Äôs something to get that you haven‚Äôt experienced yet. Many people feel that death will take something away from them. The wise person realizes that death is constantly giving them something. Death is giving meaning to your life. You‚Äôre the one who throws your life away; you waste every second of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 168
is much more efficient to deal with the body in a balanced manner than to be burdened with the effects of the extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 170
For the being who is in the Tao, events take place and last just as long as they are taking place. That‚Äôs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 170
As you let go, it comes back to center. You don‚Äôt follow the extremes, so your energy comes back to the current moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 170
Now let‚Äôs go sailing when there‚Äôs tremendous wind but there‚Äôs no sail. That is the opposite extreme and, again, we‚Äôre not going anywhere. Sailing is such a good example because there are many forces interacting together. There‚Äôs the wind, the sail, the rudder, and the tension of the ropes on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 171
In the Tao, you are blind, and you have to learn how to be blind. You can never see where the Tao is going; you can only be there with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 174
You don‚Äôt feel resentment toward people. You don‚Äôt close or get tight as often. Things still happen that you don‚Äôt want to happen, but they don‚Äôt seem to touch you as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 174
As you associate less with the physical and psychological parts of your being, you begin to identify more with the flow of pure energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 174
Your backdrop is openness, beauty, and appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 175
You don‚Äôt have to make yourself feel that way; that is how Spirit feels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 175
how the body normally feels, you might say that it‚Äôs generally uncomfortable about one thing or another. How about the psyche? If you were being totally honest, you‚Äôd probably say that it‚Äôs generally full of complaints and fears. Well, how does Spirit normally feel? The truth is, it always feels good. It always feels high. It always feels open and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 175
As you let go and willingly release the physical, emotional, and mental aspects of your being, Spirit becomes your state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 177
When you walk through a beautiful botanical garden, you feel open and light. You feel love. You see beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 103
You cannot spend your life avoiding things that are not actually happening, or everything will become negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 103
Probably more than there are stars in the sky. If you want to grow and be free to explore life, you cannot spend your life avoiding the myriad things that might hurt your heart or mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 103
You must look inside yourself and determine that from now on pain is not a problem. It is just a thing in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 103
with it, you will devote your life to avoiding it. If you feel insecurity, it‚Äôs just a feeling. You can handle a feeling. If you feel embarrassed, it‚Äôs just a feeling. It‚Äôs just a part of creation. If you feel jealousy and your heart burns, just look at it objectively, like you would a mild bruise. It‚Äôs a thing in the universe that is passing through your system. Laugh at it, have fun with it, but don‚Äôt be afraid of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 103
it. It cannot touch you unless you touch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 104
Wise beings do not want to remain a slave to the fear of pain. They permit the world to be what it is instead of being afraid of it. They wholeheartedly participate in life, but not for the purpose of using life to avoid themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 104
let it pass through you like the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 105
Just start seeing these inner experiences as energy passing through your heart and before the eye of your consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 105
relax. Do the opposite of contracting and closing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 106
If you have any wisdom, you will leave it alone and not try to change your life to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 106
you. If you do not care, if you are no longer afraid of yourself, you are free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 106
You will feel everything at a deeper level. You will begin to have truly beautiful experiences rise up within you. Eventually you will understand that there is an ocean of love behind all of this fear and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 112
Imagine that you found yourself in the midst of an open field where the sun was always shining. It was a beautiful place of great light and great openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:Great analogy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 116
It‚Äôs not really difficult to get past the walls. Time and again, every day, the natural flow of life collides with our walls and tries to tear them down. But time and again, we defend them. You must realize that when you defend yourself, you are really defending your walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 120
Since the analytical mind cannot handle the infinite, you created an alternate reality of finite thoughts that can remain fixed within your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 120
This mental model has become your reality. You must now struggle day and night to make the world fit your model, and you label everything that doesn‚Äôt fit as wrong, bad, or unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 120
You get frustrated and angry over simple little things. This is the result of being unable to fit what‚Äôs actually happening into your model of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 120
In order to truly go beyond your model, you must first understand why you built it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 121
If you really want to see why you do things, then don‚Äôt do them and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:interesting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 121
The moment somebody starts behaving in a way that is outside your expectations, your mind starts talking. It says, ‚ÄúWhat should I do about this? I can‚Äôt just ignore what he did. I could confront him directly or ask someone else to talk to him.‚Äù Your mind is telling you to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:fix it in order to fit into your model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
This zone is finite. All attempts to stay within it keep you finite. Going beyond always means letting go of the effort to keep things within your defined limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
In other words, you can devote your whole life to the process of making sure everything fits within your limited model, or you can devote your life to freeing yourself from the limits of your model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
But in truth, the confines of your comfort zone create just such a cage. This inner cage doesn‚Äôt limit your body; it limits the expanse of your consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
If you examine this, you will see that you‚Äôre willing to stay in this cage because you‚Äôre afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
They don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúGet me out of here! I‚Äôm locked in this tiny world in which everything has to be a certain way. I have to worry about what everybody‚Äôs doing, what I look like, and everything I‚Äôve ever said. I want out.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 123
You see that you‚Äôre afraid to tell people what you really think. You see that you‚Äôre too self-conscious to freely express yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 124
Spirituality begins when you decide that you‚Äôll never stop trying. Spirituality is the commitment to go beyond,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 126
The day unfolds and the mind doesn‚Äôt say anything. You simply interact with the day with a peaceful, fully inspired heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 129
on. The more consciousness narrows its focus onto this mental structure, the greater the tendency to utilize it to define the concept of self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 130
Who are you that is lost and trying to build a concept of yourself in order to be found?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:why design a concept of self?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 130
You will never find yourself in what you have built to define yourself. You‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs doing the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 130
In this panic, in this lost state, you learned to cling and hold onto the thoughts and emotions that were passing before you. You used them to build a personality, a persona, a self-concept that would allow you to define yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 131
If you get that model down absolutely right, and behave consistently every time, you have actually ‚Äúcreated‚Äù someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 131
It got engrained in you at a very young age,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 134
the events that happen in the moment belong to the moment. They don‚Äôt belong to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 135
When your mind is disturbed, don‚Äôt ask, ‚ÄúWhat do I do about this?‚Äù Instead ask, ‚ÄúWho am I that notices this?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 136
aware. If you pass through a period of darkness or depression, just ask, ‚ÄúWho is aware of the darkness?‚Äù That‚Äôs how you pass through the different stages of your inner growth. You just keep letting go, and remain aware that you are still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 136
When you‚Äôve let go of the dark psyche, and you‚Äôve let go of the light psyche, and you‚Äôre no longer clinging to anything, you will reach a point where it will all open up behind you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 136
You will then walk through every moment of your daily life with the flow of this inner force sustaining you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 136
You will still have thoughts, emotions, and a self-concept floating around in inner space, but they will be just one small part of what you experience. You will not identify with anything outside the sense of Self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 143
Events don‚Äôt determine whether or not you‚Äôre going to be happy. They‚Äôre just events. You determine whether or not you‚Äôre going to be happy. You can be happy just to be alive. You can be happy having all these things happen to you, and then be happy to die. If you can live this way, your heart will be so open and your Spirit will be so free, that you will soar up to the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 143
You‚Äôre sitting on a planet spinning around in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Go ahead, take a look at reality. You‚Äôre floating in empty space in a universe that goes on forever. If you have to be here, at least be happy and enjoy the experience. You‚Äôre going to die anyway. Things are going to happen anyway. Why shouldn‚Äôt you be happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 144
Every time a part of you begins to get unhappy, let it go. Work with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 145
The technique of unconditional happiness is ideal because what you‚Äôre doing with the rest of your life is already defined‚Äîyou‚Äôre letting go of yourself so that you can remain happy. As far as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 146
your spirituality goes, you‚Äôre going to grow very rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 146
They‚Äôre also going to notice the purification of their mind because they are not getting involved in the mind‚Äôs melodrama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 148
Everything I look at just creates waves of joy inside me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 148
God in the yogic tradition is Satchitananda‚ÄîEternal, Conscious Bliss. God is ecstasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 149
If you‚Äôre neither pushing life away, nor pulling it toward you, then you are not creating any resistance. You are simply present. In this state, you are just witnessing and experiencing the events of life taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 150
your being. It is what makes your arms and legs move. They don‚Äôt just move randomly by themselves. They move the way they do because you assert will to make them do so. You use the same will to hold onto thoughts when you want to concentrate on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 151
Eventually you‚Äôll see that this resistance is a tremendous waste of energy. The fact is, you‚Äôre generally using your will to resist one of two things: that which has already happened or that which hasn‚Äôt happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 151
It is not life‚Äôs events that are causing problems or stress. It is your resistance to life‚Äôs events that is causing this experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 152
This is because we don‚Äôt all have the same preconceived notions of how things should be or how much they should matter to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 152
If you want to understand stress, begin by realizing that you carry around with you your own set of preconceived notions of how things should be. It is based upon these notions that you assert your will to resist what has already happened. Where did you get these preconceived notions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 153
begin dealing with each situation with acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 153
This is because events are not problems; they‚Äôre just events. Your resistance to them is what causes the problem. But, again, don‚Äôt think that because you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 153
You will be surprised to find that in most situations there‚Äôs nothing to deal with except for your own fears and desires. Fear and desire make everything seem so complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.&lt;/p&gt;

We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread.

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 75
It is this spiritual freedom‚Äîwhich cannot be taken away‚Äîthat makes life meaningful and purposeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 76
Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 76
this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 76
Of the prisoners only a few kept their full inner liberty and obtained those values which their suffering afforded, but even one such example is sufficient proof that man‚Äôs inner strength may raise him above his outward fate.&lt;/p&gt;

Logotherapy focuses rather on the future, that is to say, on the meanings to be fulfilled by the patient in his future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 104
this striving to find a meaning in one‚Äôs life is the primary motivational force in man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 104
a will to meaning in contrast to the pleasure principle (or, as we could also term it, the will to pleasure) on which Freudian psychoanalysis is centered, as well as in contrast to the will to power on which Adlerian psychology, using the term ‚Äústriving for superiority,‚Äù is focused.&lt;/p&gt;

being. Logotherapy deviates from psychoanalysis insofar as it considers man a being whose main concern consists in fulfilling a meaning, rather than in the mere gratification and satisfaction of drives and instincts, or in merely reconciling the conflicting claims of id, ego and superego, or in the mere adaptation and adjustment to society and environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 110
I consider it a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to assume that what man needs in the first place is equilibrium or, as it is called in biology, ‚Äúhomeostasis,‚Äù i.e., a tensionless state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 110
man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 112
That is why existential frustration often eventuates in sexual compensation. We can observe in such cases that the sexual libido becomes rampant in the existential vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúEvery therapy must in some way, no matter how restricted, also be logotherapy.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

To put the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess champion: ‚ÄúTell me, Master, what is the best move in the world?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 113
In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. Thus, logotherapy sees in responsibleness the very essence of human existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 114
‚ÄúLive as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

there is nothing which would stimulate a man‚Äôs sense of responsibleness more than this maxim,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 114
invites him to imagine first that the present is past and, second, that the past may yet be changed and amended. Such a precept confronts him with life‚Äôs finiteness as well as the finality of what he makes out of both his life and himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 114
Logotherapy tries to make the patient fully aware of his own responsibleness;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 114
a logotherapist is the least tempted of all psychotherapists to impose value judgments on his patients,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 114
A painter tries to convey to us a picture of the world as he sees it; an ophthalmologist tries to enable us to see the world as it really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 115
The logotherapist‚Äôs role consists of widening and broadening the visual field of the patient so that the whole spectrum of potential meaning becomes conscious and visible to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 115
‚Äúthe self-transcendence of human existence.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 115
The more one forgets himself‚Äîby giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love‚Äîthe more human he is and the more he actualizes himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 115
In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 115
ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 116
No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 116
Love is as primary a phenomenon as sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 116
Thus love is not understood as a mere side-effect of sex; rather, sex is a way of expressing the experience of that ultimate togetherness which is called love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 116
For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 117
suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 117
I could not change his fate; I could not revive his wife. But in that moment I did succeed in changing his attitude toward his unalterable fate inasmuch as from that time on he could at least see a meaning in his suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 117
basic tenets of logotherapy that man‚Äôs main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118
‚Äúour current mental-hygiene philosophy stresses the idea that people ought to be happy, that unhappiness is a symptom of maladjustment.&lt;/p&gt;

Are you sure that the human world is a terminal point in the evolution of the cosmos? Is it not conceivable that there is still another dimension, a world beyond man‚Äôs world; a world in which the question of an ultimate meaning of human suffering would find an answer?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
What is demanded of man is not, as some existential philosophers teach, to endure the meaninglessness of life,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
but rather to bear his incapacity to grasp its unconditional meaningfulness in rational terms. Logos is deeper than logic.&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, the transitoriness of our existence in no way makes it meaningless. But it does constitute our responsibleness; for everything hinges upon our realizing the essentially transitory possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 124
At any moment, man must decide, for better or for worse, what will be the monument of his existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 124

Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

This anticipatory anxiety resulted both in excessive intention to confirm her femininity and excessive attention centered upon herself rather than upon her partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 126
Logotherapy bases its technique called ‚Äúparadoxical intention‚Äù on the twofold fact that fear brings about that which one is afraid of, and that hyper-intention makes impossible what one wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 127
In this approach the phobic patient is invited to intend, even if only for a moment, precisely that which he&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 127
fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 127
The reader will note that this procedure consists of a reversal of the patient‚Äôs attitude, inasmuch as his fear is replaced by a paradoxical wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 127
By this treatment, the wind is taken out of the sails of the anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

however, must make use of the specifically human capacity for self-detachment inherent in a sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 127

The fear of sleeplessness13 results in a hyper-intention to fall asleep, which, in turn, incapacitates the patient to do so. To overcome this particular fear, I usually advise the patient not to try to sleep but rather to try to do just the opposite, that is, to stay awake as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 129
the hyper-intention to fall asleep, arising from the anticipatory anxiety of not being able to do so, must be replaced by the paradoxical intention not to fall asleep, which soon will be followed by sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 130
traditional psychotherapy has insisted that therapeutic practices have to be based on findings on etiology,&lt;/p&gt;

certain factors might cause neuroses during early childhood and that entirely different factors might relieve neuroses during adulthood.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 130
A similar chain of events, however, can be observed in obsessive-compulsive cases in which the patient fights the ideas which haunt him.16 Thereby, however, he increases their power to disturb him, since pressure precipitates counterpressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 131
On the other hand, as soon as the patient stops fighting his obsessions and instead tries to ridicule them by dealing with them in an ironical way‚Äîby applying paradoxical intention‚Äîthe vicious circle is cut, the symptom diminishes and finally atrophies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 131
As we see, anticipatory anxiety has to be counteracted by paradoxical intention; hyper-intention as well as hyper-reflection have to be counteracted by dereflection;&lt;/p&gt;

Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 139
question, How is it possible to say yes to life in spite of all that? How, to pose the question differently, can life retain its potential meaning in spite of its tragic aspects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 139
And this in turn presupposes the human capacity to creatively turn life‚Äôs negative aspects into something positive or constructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 140
(1) turning suffering into a human achievement and accomplishment; (2) deriving from guilt the opportunity to change oneself for the better; and (3) deriving from life‚Äôs transitoriness an incentive to take responsible action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 140
But happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 140
As we see, a human being is not one in pursuit of happiness but rather in search of a reason to become happy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 140
actualizing the potential meaning inherent and dormant in a given situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 140
This need for a reason is similar in another specifically human phenomenon‚Äîlaughter. If you want anyone to laugh you have to provide him with a reason, e.g., you have to tell him a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 140
In no way is it possible to evoke real laughter by urging him, or having him urge himself, to laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 141
Indeed, what is called ‚Äúthe pleasure principle‚Äù is, rather, a fun-spoiler.&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúInfinite intelligence leads and guides me in all my ways. Perfect health is mine, and the Law of Harmony operates in my mind and body. Beauty, love, peace, and abundance are mine. The principle of right action and divine order govern my entire life. I know my major premise is based on the eternal truths of life, and I know, feel, and believe that my subconscious mind responds according to the nature of my conscious mind thinking.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

Your greatest power is your capacity to choose. Choose happiness and abundance.&lt;/p&gt;

A book called The Quimby Manuscripts,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,261
Dr.¬†Quimby diagnosed her case as a mind cloudy and stagnated, due to excitation and fear, caused by the inability to see clearly the meaning of the passage of the Bible, which she had been reading.&lt;/p&gt;

Your dominant idea, which would be the picture of falling, would conquer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,442
your subconscious is always controlled by the dominant idea. Your subconscious will accept the stronger of two contradictory propositions. The effortless way is the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,445
Never try to compel the subconscious mind to accept your idea by exercising will power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,450
This is an example of the law of reversed effort whereby you get the opposite of what you asked or prayed for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,458
The reason for this is that the highest degree of outcropping of the subconscious occurs prior to sleep and just after we awaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,476
Mental coercion or too much effort shows anxiety and fear, which block your answer. Easy does it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,477
When your mind is relaxed and you accept an idea, your subconscious goes to work to execute the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,478
Think and plan independently of traditional methods. Know that there is always an answer and a solution to every problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,479
Do not be overly concerned with the beating of your heart, with the breathing of your lungs, or the functions of any part of your anatomy. Lean heavily upon your subconscious and proclaim frequently that Divine right action is taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

health; the feeling of wealth produces wealth. How do you feel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,482
Imagination is your most powerful faculty. Imagine what is lovely and of good report. You are what you imagine yourself to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,483
You avoid conflict between your conscious and subconscious in the sleepy state. Imagine the fulfillment of your desire over and over again prior to sleep. Sleep in peace and wake in joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,488
Do the thing you love to do, and do it for the joy and thrill of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,513
Your affirmation succeeds best when it is specific and when it does not produce a mental conflict or argument;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,514
The dominant idea or belief is always accepted by the subconscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,517
‚ÄúBy day and by night I am being prospered in all of my interests.‚Äù This affirmation will not arouse any argument because it does not contradict your subconscious mind‚Äôs impression of financial lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,546
The way to overcome this emotion is to say to yourself, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it wonderful! I rejoice in that man‚Äôs prosperity. I wish for him greater and greater&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,547
To entertain envious thoughts is devastating because it places you in a very negative position; therefore, wealth flows from you instead of to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,549
This will neutralize the negative thoughts in your mind and cause an ever greater measure of wealth to flow to you by the law of your own subconscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,557
Decide to be wealthy the easy way, with the infallible aid of your subconscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,558
Trying to accumulate wealth by the sweat of your brow and hard labor is one way to become the richest man in the graveyard. You do not have to strive or slave hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,560
Wealth is a subconscious conviction. Build into your mentality the idea of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,560
The trouble with most people is that they have no invisible means of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,563
The feeling of wealth produces wealth. Keep this in mind at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,564
The dominant idea is always accepted by your subconscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,565
You can overcome any mental conflict regarding wealth by affirming frequently,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,571
Your true source of wealth consists of the ideas in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,573
The block to wealth is in your own mind. Destroy that block now by getting on good mental terms with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

You are here to grow, expand, and unfold spiritually, mentally, and materially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,579
Your desire to be rich is a desire for a fuller, happier, more wonderful life. It is a cosmic urge. It is not only good, but also very good.&lt;/p&gt;

thinking of and resenting the fact you are underpaid, that you are not appreciated, and that you deserve more money and greater recognition, you are subconsciously severing your ties with that organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,670
Be bold enough to claim that it is your right to be rich and your deeper mind will honor your claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,671
You want all the money you need to do all the things you want to do and when you want to do them. Get acquainted with the riches of your subconscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,679
your subconscious mind will give you compound interest in all these fields of expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,682
You lose what you criticize. There is nothing good or bad, but thinking of it in either light makes it so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,687
You must give to receive. You must give mental attention to your goals, ideals, and enterprises, and your deeper mind will back you up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,689

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,835
Make the picture vivid and real. Hear the voice, see the gestures, and feel the reality of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,837
Your subconscious mind is a storehouse of memory. For a perfect memory, affirm frequently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,887
and sharp, fast thinking commissars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,952
By giving your conscious attention and devotion to the solution of a perplexing problem, your subconscious mind gathers all the necessary information and presents it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,957
You delay the answer by thinking it will take a long time or that it is a major problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,960
Any mental picture, backed by faith and perseverance, will come to pass through the miracle-working power of your subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 1,961
Your subconscious is the storehouse of memory, and within your subconscious are recorded all your experiences since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

He discovered that happiness is a habit.&lt;/p&gt;

Aurelius, the great Roman philosopher and sage, said, ‚ÄúA man‚Äôs life is what his thoughts make of it.‚Äù Emerson, America‚Äôs foremost philosopher, said, ‚ÄúA man is what he thinks all day long.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,295
Too many people have the idea that it takes something artificial to produce happiness. Some say,&lt;/p&gt;

I read a newspaper article some years ago, which told about a horse that had shied when he came to a stump on the road. Subsequently, every time the horse came to that same stump, he shied. The farmer dug the stump out, burned it, and leveled the old road. Yet, for&lt;/p&gt;

The best are not only the happiest, but the happiest are usually the best in the art of living life successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,348
happiness. External things are not causative; these are effects, not cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,349
Your thought is cause, and a new cause produces a new effect. Choose happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

He began to realize that he should give the newspaperman freedom to express himself even though the latter disagreed with him politically, religiously, or in any other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,427
What the other person says or does cannot really annoy or irritate you except you permit him to disturb you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,428
The only way he can annoy you is through your own thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,428
For example, if you get angry, you have to go through four stages in your mind: You begin to think about what he said. You decide to get angry and generate an emotion of rage. Then, you decide to act. Perhaps, you talk back and react in kind. You see that the thought, emotion, reaction, and action all take place in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,432
Identify yourself with your aim in life, and do not permit any person, place, or thing to deflect you from your inner sense of peace, tranquility, and radiant health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,434
Sigmund Freud, the Austrian founder of psychoanalysis, said that unless the personality has love, it sickens and dies. Love includes understanding, good will, and respect for the divinity in the other person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,462
this is called empathy, which simply means the imaginative projection of your mental attitude into that of another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,486
You are responsible for the way you think about the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,486
Remember, the other person is not responsible for the way you think about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,487
7. Become emotionally mature and permit other people to differ from you. They have a perfect right to disagree with you, and you have the same freedom to disagree with them. You can disagree without being disagreeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,491
Your inner speech, representing your silent thoughts and feelings, is experienced in the reactions of others toward you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,492
Wish for the other what you wish for yourself. This is the key to harmonious human relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,494
The other person cannot annoy you or irritate you except you permit him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,494
Your thought is creative; you can bless him. If someone calls you a skunk, you have the freedom to say to the other, ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs peace fills your soul.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,497
You would not hate a hunchback or cripple. You would have compassion. Have compassion and understanding for mental hunchbacks who have been conditioned negatively. To understand all is to forgive all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,498
Rejoice in the success, promotion, and good fortune of the other. In doing so, you attract good fortune to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 2,540
Forgiveness is to forgive yourself. Forgiveness is getting your thoughts in line with the divine law of harmony.&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúTHE OBSTACLE IS THE WAY.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 155
Who do I want to be? And: What path will I take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 158
you go looking you‚Äôll find that history is also made by individuals who fought their egos at every turn, who eschewed the spotlight, and who put their higher goals above their desire for recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 163
virtue begins with understanding and is fulfilled by courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Location: 172
as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work you‚Äôve set out to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 1
But for people with ambitions, talents, drives, and potential to fulfill, ego comes with the territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 2
‚Äúsucks us down like the law of gravity.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 3
‚ÄúThe egotist does not stumble about, knocking things off his desk. He does not stammer or drool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 6
Most of us are in these stages in a fluid sense‚Äîwe‚Äôre aspiring until we succeed, we succeed until we fail or until we aspire to more, and after we fail we can begin to aspire or succeed again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 6
Humble in our aspirations Gracious in our success Resilient in our failures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 20
Our cultural values almost try to make us dependent on validation, entitled, and ruled by our emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 21
One might say that the ability to evaluate one‚Äôs own ability is the most important skill of all. Without it, improvement is impossible. And certainly ego makes it difficult every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 21
What is rare is not raw talent, skill, or even confidence, but &lt;strong&gt;humility, diligence, and self-awareness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 26
In actuality, silence is strength‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 26
Silence is the respite of the confident and the strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 27
Research shows that while goal visualization is important, after a certain point our mind begins to confuse it with actual progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 27
Success requires a full 100 percent of our effort, and talk flitters part of that effort away before we can use it.&lt;/p&gt;

Like many high achievers, the soldier was insecure and impressionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 32
Having authority is not the same as being an authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 33
This is what the ego does. It crosses out what matters and replaces it with what doesn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 33
What is your purpose? What are you here to do? Because purpose helps you answer the question ‚ÄúTo be or to do?‚Äù quite easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 33
If your purpose is something larger than you‚Äîto accomplish something, to prove something to yourself‚Äîthen suddenly everything becomes both easier and more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 34
It‚Äôs about the doing, not the recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 34
In this course, it is not ‚ÄúWho do I want to be in life?‚Äù but ‚ÄúWhat is it that I want to accomplish in life?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

Wooden at UCLA, used one word to describe the style of his famous coach: ‚Äúdispassionate.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 46
Instead, his philosophy was about being in control and doing your job and never being ‚Äúpassion‚Äôs slave.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 46
What is really called for in these circumstances is clarity, deliberateness, and methodological determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 48
Passion typically masks a weakness. Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance. You need to be able to spot this in others and in yourself, because while the origins of passion may be earnest and good, its effects are comical and then monstrous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 49
What humans require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose, you could say, is like passion with boundaries. Realism is detachment and perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 49
More than purpose, we also need realism. Where do we start? What do we do first? What do we do right now? How are we sure that what we‚Äôre doing is moving us forward? What are we benchmarking ourselves against?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 49
‚ÄúGreat passions are maladies without hope,‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 50
Passion is form over function. Purpose is function, function, function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 50
Leave passion for the amateurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 50
Then you will do great things. Then you will stop being your old, good-intentioned, but ineffective self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 53
Find canvases for other people to paint on. Be an anteambulo. Clear the path for the people above you and you will eventually create a path for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 53
When you are just starting out, we can be sure of a few fundamental realities: 1) You‚Äôre not nearly as good or as important as you think you are; 2) You have an attitude that needs to be readjusted; 3) Most of what you think you know or most of what you learned in books or in school is out of date or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 54
Obeisance is the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 56
Greatness comes from humble beginnings; it comes from grunt work. It means you‚Äôre the least important person in the room‚Äîuntil you change that with results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 56
Imagine if for every person you met, you thought of some way to help them, something you could do for them? And you looked at it in a way that entirely benefited them and not you. The cumulative effect this would have over time would be profound: You‚Äôd learn a great deal by solving diverse problems. You‚Äôd develop a reputation for being indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;

The strategy part of it is the hardest. It‚Äôs easy to be bitter, like&lt;/p&gt;

absolute opposite of what is needed. Who can afford to be jerked around by impulses, or believe that you‚Äôre god‚Äôs gift to humanity, or too important to put up with anything you don‚Äôt like?

It is not enough only to be a student at the beginning. It is a position that one has to assume for life. Learn from everyone and everything. From the people you beat, and the people who beat you, from the people you dislike, even from your supposed enemies. At every step and every juncture in life, there is the opportunity to learn‚Äîand even if the lesson is purely remedial, we must not let ego block us from hearing it again.&lt;/p&gt;

Put yourself in rooms where you‚Äôre the least knowledgeable person. That uncomfortable feeling, that defensiveness that you feel when your most deeply held assumptions are challenged‚Äîwhat about subjecting yourself to it deliberately? Change your mind. Change your surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

An amateur is defensive. The professional finds learning (and even, occasionally, being shown up) to be enjoyable; they like being challenged and humbled, and engage in education as an ongoing and endless process.&lt;/p&gt;

Reducing it to a narrative retroactively creates a clarity that never was and never will be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 111
When we are aspiring we must resist the impulse to reverse engineer success from other people‚Äôs stories. When we achieve our own, we must resist the desire to pretend that everything unfolded exactly as we‚Äôd planned. There was no grand narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúThe way to do really big things seems to be to start with deceptively small things.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 112
‚ÄúKeep your identity small,‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 113
The same goes for us, whatever we do. Instead of pretending that we are living some great story, we must remain focused on the execution‚Äîand on executing with excellence. We must shun the false crown and continue working on what got us here. Because that‚Äôs the only thing that will keep us here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 115
That‚Äôs how it seems to go: we‚Äôre never happy with what we have, we want what others have too. We want to have more than everyone else. We start out knowing what is important to us, but once we‚Äôve achieved it, we lose sight of our priorities. Ego sways us, and can ruin us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 116
All of us waste precious life doing things we don‚Äôt like, to prove ourselves to people we don‚Äôt respect, and to get things we don‚Äôt want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 117
On an individual level, however, it‚Äôs absolutely critical that you know who you‚Äôre competing with and why, that you have a clear sense of the space you‚Äôre in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 117
it is the sense of our own path and how to stay on it without getting distracted by all the others that intersect it. In other words, it‚Äôs not about beating the other guy. It‚Äôs not about having more than the others. It‚Äôs about being what you are, and being as good as possible at it, without succumbing to all the things that draw you away from it. It‚Äôs about going where you set out to go. About accomplishing the most that you‚Äôre capable of in what you choose. That‚Äôs it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118
It‚Äôs time to sit down and think about what‚Äôs truly important to you and then take steps to forsake the rest. Without this, success will not be pleasurable, or nearly as complete as it could be. Or worse, it won‚Äôt last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118
Ego rejects trade-offs. Why compromise? Ego wants it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 118
So why do you do what you do? That‚Äôs the question you need to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 121
Achieving success involved ignoring the doubts and reservations of the people around us. It meant rejecting rejection. It required taking certain risks. We could have given up at any time, but we‚Äôre here precisely because we didn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 122
Driven to prove the doubters wrong? Welcome to the seeds of paranoia.&lt;/p&gt;

Probably because he was in such command of his own temper, Franklin decided that writing the letter was cathartic enough. He never sent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow highlight | Page: 127
He knew that urgent and important were not synonyms. His job was to set the priorities, to think big picture, and then trust the people beneath him to do the jobs they were hired for.&lt;/p&gt;

we can be idiosyncratic, we can compensate for disorganization with hard work and a little luck. That‚Äôs not going to cut it in the majors. In fact, it‚Äôll sink you if you can‚Äôt grow up and organize.&lt;/p&gt;

your responsibilities may begin to change. Days become less and less about doing and more and more about making decisions. Such is the nature of leadership. This transition requires reevaluating and updating your identity.&lt;/p&gt;

In a similar position, we might have sprung into ‚Äúbold‚Äù action; we might have gotten angry or drawn a line in the sand. We have to stand up for ourselves, right? But do we? So often, this is just ego, escalating tension more than dealing with it.&lt;/p&gt;

They focus, in short, on hard assets instead of soft assets. This is a mistake. We‚Äôre not suggesting you be a starving, unshaven graduate student forever; you do need to earn money and build economic assets. But as much as you can, prioritize plans that offer the best chance at learning&lt;/p&gt;
