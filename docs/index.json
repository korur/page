S. Eliot\nI was reading lately lots of books on productivity and self-development and often I found pieces of advice that I want to re-read later. The highlighting option on kindle makes this very easy. By reading and highlighting consistently I accumulated a sizeable amount text which was a good representation of the books I read.\nSince I know the content very well. I want to apply text mining and sentiment analysis to this data so that I can compare the results to my real opinion about the books. And if they match I will be more convinced to apply it to my next business problem.\nIn part, this is also a self-exploration, since I could answer questions such as what kind of content I like more, what was their emotional charge?\nLet‚Äôs find the answers.\nTo be objective, I will create an independent character called ‚Äúthe bat‚Äù. His next mission is to hack my data and analyze it to gather insights for selling me more books. Unfortunately, reading is not his specialty.\nThe room was in a mess when he entered. As he plugged the USB drive on his laptop, he barely heard the radio which was still on. The reporter:\n\rFrom the moment we switch on the early morning our cell phones to deal with the flood of information in some form of a whatsapp or facebook message or a tweet until we fall asleep at night overwriting or reading a product review we leave bread crumbs to our personal flavors on internet.\n\r\rMany businesses use this unstructured data to drive their sales by better marketing through targeted product recommendations or to segregate their customers‚Ä¶\n\rHe squeezed his teeth when he saw the data of 21000 lines of text from 28 books. His first encounter was the book ‚ÄúMindset‚Äù by Carol Dweck, where she introduces the concept of growth mindset. The idea behind is people who have the growth mindset believe their abilities can be improved by putting effort whereas the people with the fixed mindset believe that their abilities are fixed at birth. As a consequence, people who has the fixed mindset miss the opportunity to get better at many things even though they can. Simply, because they don‚Äôt believe in it in the first place.\nIf you are not familiar with the concept, here is a video of Carol Dweck explaining her research on growth mindset.\nLong lines of text made him tired, he didn‚Äôt realize how the time passed. Now, he was a man of growth. He decided to learn text mining.\nHe started to learn the R packages for text mining, he didn‚Äôt like the package name tidytext but he was slightly losing his prejudices. It was a long night. He fell asleep on his table as the sun slowly rose.\r‚Ä¶\nIt was lighting my back garden where I could glance from time to time to the trees painted by the snow overnight ‚õÑÔ∏è. Without an idea about how things went on the another part of the town, I continued to read and highlight my kindle as I zip from a glass of red wine üç∑.\n‚Ä¶\nWe will know what happened to our hacker later. First, let‚Äôs go together through his notebook.\nThe hacker‚Äôs notes\nHe noted down each step of his text mining plan carefully. Let me help you go through them.\nThis is how the exported kindle highlights look like.Reading and parsing the text file\n# Use readLines function to parse the text file\rhighlights \u0026lt;- readLines(\u0026quot;posts_data/Kindle_highlights_Serdar.Rmd\u0026quot;, encoding = \u0026quot;UTF-8\u0026quot;)\r# Create a dataframe where each row is a line from the text\rdf \u0026lt;- data.frame(highlights)\r# Packages\rlibrary(tidyverse) # includes ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats\rlibrary(tidytext)\rlibrary(wordcloud2)\rEvery data science project requires some sort of data preparation. Stop words are generally the most common words in a language and are usually filtered out before processing of text data.\nLet‚Äôs look at the stop_words dataset from the tidytext package. Since it is a long list of words (\u0026gt;1K) I will print every fifth word as an example.\ndata(stop_words)\r# print every 50th word stop_words_small \u0026lt;- stop_words[seq(1, nrow(stop_words), 50),]\rstop_words_small %\u0026gt;% print(n=50)\r## # A tibble: 23 x 2\r## word lexicon ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 a SMART ## 2 at SMART ## 3 contain SMART ## 4 few SMART ## 5 hers SMART ## 6 last SMART ## 7 nine SMART ## 8 presumably SMART ## 9 some SMART ## 10 they\u0026#39;d SMART ## 11 very SMART ## 12 without SMART ## 13 what snowball\r## 14 they\u0026#39;ll snowball\r## 15 during snowball\r## 16 again onix ## 17 but onix ## 18 finds onix ## 19 if onix ## 20 much onix ## 21 parted onix ## 22 since onix ## 23 under onix\rEvery data science project requires some sort of data preparation. Stop words are generally the most common words in a language and are usually filtered out before processing of text data.\ne.g.¬†they‚Äôll in stop_words\nAnd how the word they‚Äôll appears in the text:\nYellow highlight | Page: 200\rMemories are continually revised, along with the meaning we derive from them, so that in the future they‚Äôll be of even more use.\nWe have to make stop_words and our data compatible, otherwise some words such as they‚Äôll, don‚Äôt, can‚Äôt might appear in our results.\nWe can use str_replace_all() function from stringr package to find all the apostrophes and convert them into single quotes.\ndf$highlights \u0026lt;- str_replace_all(df$highlights, \u0026quot;‚Äô\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026#39;\u0026quot;)\rNow, the text is ready for the frequency analysis. Words in a text mining project are called tokens. We can split the text into single words by unnest_tokens() function from tidytext package, filter the stop_words and count.\ndf \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% unnest_tokens(word, highlights) %\u0026gt;%\ranti_join(stop_words) %\u0026gt;% filter(!word %in% c(\u0026quot;highlights\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;highlight\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;page\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;location\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;yellow\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pink\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;))\rHe also added here some additional words which frequently appear in kindle highlights output.\ndplyr() package functions are very useful for grouping and counting the words from the lists that are created.\ntop_kindle_highlights \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% group_by(word) %\u0026gt;% count() %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(n))\rHe noted down his first insight. 10 most frequent words from my kindle highlights.\ntop_kindle_highlights\r## # A tibble: 12,433 x 2\r## # Groups: word [12,433]\r## word n\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt;\r## 1 people 592\r## 2 story 340\r## 3 life 318\r## 4 time 309\r## 5 mind 213\r## 6 change 212\r## 7 feel 211\r## 8 world 171\r## 9 person 170\r## 10 habits 157\r## # ... with 12,423 more rows\rIf you don‚Äôt like to look at long list of words wordclouds are a good alternative. Wordcloud2 package gives additional customization options for your wordclouds, for example you can use any image as a markup.wordcloud2(top_kindle_highlights, figPath = bat, size = 1, backgroundColor = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;, color = color_vector(data$freq) )\rSome ideas started to get shaped in his mind. He thought who made those highlights is someone interested in storytelling, writing and good communication, good habits, and people. Someone who wants to influence his life in a positive way. He was becoming more and more interested in the books.\nHe wanted to dig deeper.\nBigram Analysis\nSingle words are a good starting point what the books were about. But they are limited without the context. Frequency analysis can also be performed to measure how often word pairs (bigrams) occur in the text. This allows us to capture finer details in the text.\nTo do this he combined the unnested single tokens which is isolated above back into a continuous text and then performed bigram analysis. You can use str_c() function from stringr package to concatenate the single words.\n# Recreate the df\rdf \u0026lt;- data.frame(highlights)\rdf$highlights \u0026lt;- str_replace_all(df$highlights, \u0026quot;‚Äô\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026#39;\u0026quot;)\rdf \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% unnest_tokens(word, highlights) %\u0026gt;% anti_join(stop_words) %\u0026gt;% filter(!word %in% c(\u0026quot;highlights\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;highlight\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;page\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;location\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;yellow\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pink\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;export\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;hidden\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;truncated\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;kindle\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;note\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;limits\u0026quot;))\rdf_com \u0026lt;- str_c(df$word, \u0026quot; \u0026quot;) df_com \u0026lt;- data.frame(df_com)\rLet‚Äôs split the text into bigrams and count the most common word pairs.\ndf_bigram \u0026lt;- df_com %\u0026gt;% unnest_tokens(bigram, df_com, token = \u0026quot;ngrams\u0026quot;, n = 3, n_min = 2)\rtop_bigrams \u0026lt;- df_bigram %\u0026gt;% group_by(bigram) %\u0026gt;% count() %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(n))%\u0026gt;% print(n=20)\r## # A tibble: 107,317 x 2\r## # Groups: bigram [107,317]\r## bigram n\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt;\r## 1 body language 30\r## 2 behavior change 23\r## 3 crucial conversations 19\r## 4 fixed mindset 19\r## 5 growth mindset 19\r## 6 subconscious mind 19\r## 7 told story 18\r## 8 type person 17\r## 9 object desire 16\r## 10 system 1 16\r## 11 pay attention 15\r## 12 bad habits 13\r## 13 law behavior 13\r## 14 law behavior change 13\r## 15 social media 13\r## 16 inciting incident 12\r## 17 people feel 12\r## 18 subject matter 12\r## 19 human nature 11\r## 20 objective criteria 11\r## # ... with 1.073e+05 more rows\r# And visualize them on a plot\rtop \u0026lt;- top_bigrams[1:25,]\rtop %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% mutate(bigram = fct_reorder(bigram, n)) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=bigram, y=n)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() +\rtheme_classic() + theme(legend.position = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;,\rtext = element_text(size=18))\rI see that one of the most frequent bigrams is behavioral change. We can use this information to make sense of what we have found previously. For example, one of the most frequent word was change. And we saw with bigram analysis that the word change was used mostly in a context of behavioral change. So bigrams are useful tools to get deeper insights about the text content.\nMy highlighted text data come from 28 different books, and by looking at the most frequent words and bigrams in the whole document we got an overview of them.\nTo see how the individual books differ we can repeat this procedure for each of them.\nBut how can we capture them individually?\nLet‚Äôs first look at the text once more.Before each book ‚ÄúYour Kindle Notes For:‚Äù appears.\nLet‚Äôs find out the line numbers for the beginning and the end of each book and use those indexes for fishing out each book.\nWe will reuse the data frame df we created above. str_which() function returns line index numbers which contain an given input pattern.\nIn the final step, a for loop to capture the text between two consecutive indexes will give us the book between them.\n# Since I modified df above. I will recreate it again.\rdf \u0026lt;- data.frame(highlights)\rdf$highlights \u0026lt;- str_replace_all(df$highlights, \u0026quot;‚Äô\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026#39;\u0026quot;)\r# Getting the index number for each book\rindexes \u0026lt;- str_which(df$highlights, pattern = fixed(\u0026quot;Your Kindle Notes For\u0026quot;))\rbook_names \u0026lt;- df$highlights[indexes + 1]\rindexes \u0026lt;- c(indexes,nrow(df))\r# Create an empty list books \u0026lt;- list()\r# Now the trick.

Most common uses are social media monitoring, customer experience management, and Voice of Customer, to understand how they feel.\nThe bing lexicon categorizes words into positive and negative categories, in a binary fashion. The nrc lexicon uses categories of positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust.\nUsing bing lexicon\nI created a list of the words with highest contribution to each emotional category.

This enables you to complete the same task multiple times quicker!In R, usually computations run sequentially. When we initiate multiple tasks they are performed one after the other, new task starts only after the previous one is completed.\nThis might become the bottleneck when you come across a computationally heavy process. Such as running monte carlo simulations or fitting multiple machine learning models.Typically, if I have a process which runs longer than 3 minutes, I consider using parallel processing.\nIt might sound complicated but parallel computing is simple. When you have a repetitive task which takes too much of your valuable time why not implement it and save time? Even if you have a single task, you can benefit from parallel processing by dividing the task into smaller pieces.\nTwo widely used packages for parallel processing are parallel and foreach.\nLet‚Äôs do some parallel processing..\n\rWhat is our goal?\rI recently analyzed data from horror movies released in the world between 2012 and 2017. What caught my attention was that movies are more likely to be released at the 13th of each month. You can visit my recent post if you want to know more about this data.\nLet‚Äôs get the data\rThere are 2782 movies released in one of the 30 days (categories).

Then calculates total probabilities of any given observation or rarer events at each day from this matrix.\nThis actually translates into the p value for a given (n) observation.\rFor example, when I run multfun(124), It will give me the p value for observing a day with at least 124 movie releases.\n# Run an example\rmultfun(124)\r## [1] 0.001844267\rTo calculate the p values for the top 5 days with highest number of movie releases, I can run multfun() multiple times for each value.\nExecute the multfun() function multiple times\rsystem.time({\rmultfun(124)\rmultfun(119)\rmultfun(110)\rmultfun(107)\rmultfun(102)\r})\r## user system elapsed ## 15.72 0.21 15.94\rFor few values it can be ok, but easier methods exist if you need to run your function repetitvely for a bigger number of inputs.\n\rUsing lapply() function\rInstead of running a function for different input values several times, you can use lapply() function.

In my computer, I have 6 cores and I will assign 5 cores as the multiple workers.\nParallel processing: parLapply\rparLapply is the easiest way to parallelise computation. You first need to replace lapply with parLapply and enter an extra cluster argument.\nThen, an additional preparation step to create the clusters required. makeCluster() function creates the number of cluster that you intend to use.

We can see that rmultinom() part of takes more than 90% of the processing time.\nIf we are looking further improvement we can focus on it. To improve rmultinom() part, I will isolate it by splitting the multfun into two functions.\n In general, to be able to apply parallel processing we need to be able to dispatch our tasks as functions, with one task going to each processor. We can apply parLapply to execute multiple functions at the same time.   Above, first improvement was using parLapply instead of lapply and second replacing a loop with a faster vectorized operation. Now, we will utilize another approach, dividing a task into smaller pieces.\nI need to create a new rmultinom() function, which I call fastbinom. To keep things simple, it will take only one argument which I will use to divide 1.000.000 rmultinom simulations into 5 equal parts of 200.000 rmultinom simulations. Each will be handled by a different core in my CPU boosting my speed.\nfastbinom \u0026lt;- function(x) {\rrmultinom(x, size=2782, rep(1/30,30)) }\rmultfun_fin \u0026lt;- function(x){ p \u0026lt;- mean(avc[1:30, 1:1000000] \u0026gt;=x)\rifelse(p \u0026lt;= 0.5, p_val \u0026lt;- 2 * p, p_val \u0026lt;- 2*(1 - p))\r}\rHere comes an additional overhead.

It is all about success and failure.\nWhat are binomial distributions and why are they so useful?\rWhen we repeat a set of events like 10 times coin flipping and each single event in a set has two possible outcomes (head or tails) think about Binomial distributions. Each single event here is known as a Bernoulli Trial.\nBi- in binomial distributions refers to the two outcomes usually described as Success or no Success. A ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù.\nProbability distributions in general are used to predict future events and often based on nasty looking mathematical formulas. But, there is also a beautiful thing here. For example the specific binomial distribution mathematical function can be used to predict the outcomes of any real life event which has two outcomes.\nLet‚Äôs start with a simple example.\nWhy is this interesting?\rFor example, playing with the coins, the two possibilities are getting heads (success) or tails (no success). And let‚Äôs say you have a of e.g.¬†50 times coin flipping. We can repeat this set as many times as we like and record how many times we got heads (success) in each repetition.\nAnd if plot the results we will have a probability distribution plot. And if you make enough repetitions you will approach a binomial probability distribution curve. We will do this in a minute. But, first generate data to draw our plot.\nWe can use R to generate the data. We will generate random data from repeating set of 50-times coin flipping 100000 times and record the number of successes in each repetition.\nrbinom() function can generate a given number of repeated (here 100.000) sets (50 times of coin flipping) of experiments. It requires 3 arguments.\nrbinom(\nn = number of repetitions = 100.000,\nsize = sample size = 50,\np = the probability of success (chance of throwing heads is 0.5))\nR code can be used to find the exact probabilities. Let‚Äôs compare the probabilities of getting more than 25, 35 or even 49 heads. You can combine rbinom with mean function to find the percentage of the events with a chosen outcome.\n# Probability of getting 25 or more heads\rmean(rbinom(100000, 50, .5) \u0026gt;= 25)\r## [1] 0.55734\r# Probability of getting 35 or more heads\rmean(rbinom(100000, 50, .5) \u0026gt;= 35)\r## [1] 0.00358\r# Probability of getting 49 or more heads\rmean(rbinom(100000, 50, .5) \u0026gt;= 49)\r## [1] 0\rWe found the probability of throwing 49 or more heads to be 0. But to be technically precise it is one in 375 trillion times\r(= \\(1/((1/(2^{49}) + (1/2^{50})))\\)).\nLet‚Äôs visualize our simulation. The bars in red represents the sets which had 35 or more heads.\nlibrary(tidyverse) # ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, # purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats\rlibrary(viridis)\rheads \u0026lt;- rbinom(100000, 50, 0.5)\rheads \u0026lt;- data.frame(heads)\rheads \u0026lt;- heads %\u0026gt;% mutate(events = ifelse(heads \u0026gt; 35, \u0026quot;\u0026gt; 35\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026lt; 35\u0026quot;))\rheads %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=heads, fill = events)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;)) +\rtheme_classic() +\rtheme(text = element_text(size = 18),\rlegend.position = c(0.85, 0.85)) +\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;Number of heads in 50 coin flips\u0026quot;)\r\rBinomial probability distributions help us to understand the likelihood of rare events and to set probable expected ranges.\n\rThe above plot illustrates if we randomly flip a coin 50 times, we will most likely get between 20 to 30 successes (heads) and events such as having more more than 35 successes (heads) out of 50 trials are very unlikely. The bars in red represents the sets which had 35 or more heads.\nSo what are all those will be useful for?\nYou can impress your friends with your ability to use binomial distributions to predict coin flipping outcomes, but let‚Äôs look at other real life applications of them.\n\rThe performance of a machine learning model\r\rYou built a machine learning model with a binary outcome. Let‚Äôs say pathological image recognition algorithm for liver cancer that is 90% accurate. You tested 100 patients and you want to know your 95% confidence interval? Or your new results showed that your model detected less than 70 patients correctly. Is it possible? Or you should start optimizing your parameters again?\n\rNumber of patients responding to a treatment.\r\rLet‚Äôs say you have a new therapy for cancer which has 10% probability to cure a patient. You have 500 patients which took the drug. The expected number of recovering patients is 50. But in your trial 75 patients responded. Is this due to chance or a significant effect? Or you should start looking underlying factors if there is something about the therapy or the patient group?\n\rThink about a hospital emergency station.\r\rYou are a hospital manager and you want to organize the staff numbers correctly for different weekdays. You know total number of patients came in to a emergency station because of alcohol poisoning in a given time period. You can analyse the distribution of patient numbers for each day of the week. Most likely you will have more such cases in the weekends and you need larger staff.\nThis will be also true for other businesses. They can use binomial distributions to calculate changes in demand and plan accordingly.\n\rIf you are running a Webserver.\r\rYou can allocate your resources better by identifying times when traffic will be higher.\nSome other questions in which binomial distributions will come in handy are:\n\rNumber of people who answered ‚Äòyes‚Äô to a survey question\rHow many games a team will win in one season?\rVote counts for a candidate in an election.\rNumber of defective products in a production run.\r\r\rBinomial distributions are common and they have many applications of real life situations.\n\rWe can expand binomial distributions to multinomial distributions when instead there are more than two outcomes for the single event.\nSuch as there are 6 outcomes when rolling a die, or analyzing distributions of eye color types (Black, blue, green etc) in a population. When it is about distributions for events with multiple categories think about multinomial distributions.\nIf the number of observations(n) are large we can think of a multinomial draw as being a series of binomial draws (Gentle, 2003, pp.¬†198‚Äì199). For example, when rolling a die the 6 categories can be thought of a combination of 6 different binomial trials (getting 1, 2 ,3 and so on).\nIf you are not convinced just by reading this, I will simulate how the shape of a multinomial event changes by increasing the number of trials.Let‚Äôs use some real life data to apply our knowledge so far. The data comes from TidyTuesday which I introduced in my last post.\nIt contains data about Horror Movies released since 2012. And what I asked was whether horror movies are more likely be released at the 13th each month?\nIf you are in the right mindset anything feels better and if you are not in the mood nothing will make us happy. The mindset we have prior to an event influences what we will feel about an event. This is at least what behavioral scientist Robert Cialdini‚Äôs research says.\nImagine you are a horror movie fan and you went to the cinema. On the screen couple of ads are running just before the movie starts. You approach your mobile to turn off the voice and the date catches your attention, it is the 13th.\nAnd usually with the number 13 we associate cursed events. Do you think it will influence your impression about the movie?\nWe don‚Äôt know if this is true but I wanted to test whether movie makers have similar ideas and selected 13th as the release date more often than other days. So, I explored Horror movies data and calculated number of releases in different days of the month.\nLet‚Äôs look at the data.\nhorror_movies \u0026lt;- readr::read_csv(\u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-10-22/horror_movies.csv\u0026quot;)\rdim(horror_movies)\r## [1] 3328 12\rhead(horror_movies)\r## # A tibble: 6 x 12\r## title genres release_date release_country movie_rating review_rating\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 Gut ~ Drama~ 26-Oct-12 USA \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 3.9\r## 2 The ~ Horror 13-Jan-17 USA \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 3 Slee~ Horror 21-Oct-17 Canada \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 4 Trea~ Comed~ 23-Apr-13 USA NOT RATED 3.7\r## 5 Infi~ Crime~ 10-Apr-15 USA \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 5.8\r## 6 In E~ Horro~ 2017 UK \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## # ... with 6 more variables: movie_run_time \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, plot \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, cast \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;,\r## # language \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, filming_locations \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, budget \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;\rI need some data pre-processing before I can make my visualizations.

So expected movie release per day is 92 (2782 / 30).\nThis is a good example of a multinomial probability distribution with 30 categories, and since the number of samples are large it will approximate a binomial distribution.\nThus, we can apply binomial probability distributions for calculating the probabilities in our multinomial data.\nWe saw above that in some days more movies are released than the expected value. What we want to know is, which days are in the range of random chance and which days there is a significant preference or an aversion to release a movie.\n# Size of our distribution is the total number of movies released n_value \u0026lt;- horror_date_table %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% summarize(n2 = sum(n))\rsize \u0026lt;- n_value$n2\rsize\r## [1] 2782\r# The probability (= success rate = a given outcome to occur = movie released)\rp \u0026lt;- 1/30 # Since it can occur any of the 30 days in a months\rYou can simulate this 2782 movie release dates events 100.000 times with rbinom function and calculate the mean and variance.\n# Simulated statistics\restimates \u0026lt;- rbinom(100000, 2782, 1/30)\r# Simulated mean\rmean(estimates)\r## [1] 92.73831\r# Simulated variance\rvar(estimates)\r## [1] 90.01739\rThe average value is around 92 movies released in one day.\nWe can also calculate theoretical values by the derived mathematical formulas that define the binomial function:\nMean = size * p\nVariance = size * p * (1 - p)\nLet‚Äôs calculate.\n# Theoretical statistics\r# Expected mean = size * p\rmean_theoretical \u0026lt;- 2782 * 1/30\rmean_theoretical\r## [1] 92.73333\r# Expected Variance = size * p * (1-p)\rvar_theoretical \u0026lt;- size * 1/30 * (1-1/30)\rvar_theoretical\r## [1] 89.64222\rGreat, simulated and theoretical values are almost the same.

And the values outside will be the ones which were not due to random chance. To do this I need 2.5th and 97.5th quantiles of the distribution.\nWe can do this by the qbinom() function in r.

Higher or lower values than this range can not happen due to random chance according to our probability distribution.\n124 movies released at the 13th of any month. This value is above the 97.5th quantile. So it is significant. But what is the exact p value? Let‚Äôs define p value first.\n\rHow to calculate the p-value for a binomial test using pbinom?\r P value is the sum of the probability of that event plus the sum of the probabilities of similar events that are equally likely or less likely.   For example in coin flipping, probability of heads is (0.5). If we follow our definition, p value is the sum of the probability of that event (0.5) and similar events which is equally or less likely i.e.¬†tails (0.5). This makes our p value 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.\nSimilarly, in our horror movie data this will be the sum of the probabilities of getting 124 movie releases or events that are equally probable or rarer.\nIn R, pbinom function defines the cumulative probabilities. For example, pbinom(124, 2782, 1/30) will give us the cumulative probabilities of any number of movie releases up to 124. By using 1-pbinom(124, 2782, 1/30) we can find the sum of the probabilities with equal or lower chance than having 124.\nThus, p value for getting at least 124 movie release is;\n# Probability of getting at least 124 movie releases (e.g. the 13th)\rp_val_binom \u0026lt;- 2 * (1 - pbinom(124, 2782, 1/30))\rp_val_binom\r## [1] 0.001335455\rWe multiplied by two because same rare events can happen in the left side of our confidence interval as well.\nLet‚Äôs put those p values on our barplot to highlight the significant days.\n# I will add a new column so I can separately define values outside the 95% confidence interval.\rhorror_date_table \u0026lt;- horror_date_table %\u0026gt;% mutate(p_val = 2 * (1 - pbinom(n, 2782, 1/30, lower.tail = ifelse(n\u0026gt;93, TRUE, FALSE)))) %\u0026gt;% mutate(p_val = cut(p_val, breaks = c(-Inf, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, Inf), labels = c(\u0026quot;\u0026lt; 0.001\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;\u0026lt; 0.01\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026lt; 0.05\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;NS\u0026quot;))) # Visualize the significant days p_ci \u0026lt;- horror_date_table %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% mutate(day=fct_reorder(day, n, .desc=TRUE)) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=day, y=n)) +\rgeom_col(aes(fill=p_val)) +\rscale_fill_manual(values = viridis(4)) + theme(\rplot.title = element_text(size=24, color= \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, hjust=0.5, vjust = -1),\rplot.subtitle = element_text(size=36, color= \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, hjust=0.5, vjust = -1),\rpanel.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;), plot.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;),\rpanel.grid = element_blank(),\rtext = element_text(size=18), axis.text.x =element_text(vjust=12, size=17, colour= \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;, face= \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;),\raxis.title.x = element_text(vjust=9.5), axis.text.y=element_blank(),\raxis.ticks= element_blank(), plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, vjust = 10)) +\rlabs(\rcaption= \u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;Day of the Month\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Number of movies released\u0026quot;,\rtitle = \u0026quot;Calculating p values in binomial distributions\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_label(aes(label = n), size=5, fill=\u0026quot;yellow\u0026quot;, alpha=0.9) p_ci\rWe tested our hypothesis about movie makers and calculated the p value and used the pbinom() function and found couple of other days where movies are more or less likely to be released.\nHowever, another widely used way to calculate p values is to calculate the mean of the distribution and its standard deviation and to verify how many standard deviations the observed value is away from the mean (the z score).\nCalculating the p-value by normal approximation\rWhen the sample size is large, binomial distributions can be approximated by a normal distribution.

Simply, z-score is: how many standard deviations an observation is away from the mean. Since 95% of the observations will fall within 1.96 standard deviations from the mean in a normal distribution, a higher z-score will show that our p value is indeed significant.\n# Calculate z-score for observation 13th of the month = 124 movies are # released\robservation \u0026lt;- 124\rz_score \u0026lt;- (observation - sample_mean) / sample_sd\rz_score\r## n\r## 1 3.302367\rI can calculate the exact p value by using a normal distribution function pnorm() and the z score we found.\n# Calculate the p-value of observing 124 or more movie releases in a day\rp_val_nor \u0026lt;- 2 * pnorm(3.302, lower.tail = FALSE)\rp_val_nor\r## [1] 0.0009599807\rAs expected, I found similar values (Normal: 0.00095, Binomial: 0.00133) by using an approximation of a normal distribution and by using binomial distributions. Both methods proves that Horror movies are more likely to be released at the 13th.\n\r\rFuture thoughts / Conclusions\rMany events in real life can be explained by binomial probability distributions, and they allow us to calculate whether or not the events happened due to random chance and test our hypotheses.\nIt can be a fun data analysis such as in horror movies, or more serious subjects like testing of new medicines or predicting accuracy of machine learning algorithms detecting diseases.\nUntil next time!\nSerdar\n\r","date":1572220800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572292101,"objectID":"05a4c9e3b048645ce413f94577a15c00","permalink":"/r/probability-distributions/","publishdate":"2019-10-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/r/probability-distributions/","section":"post","summary":"Learn.

But, if we have outliers they might misguide us. In those conditions, median and quartiles will serve us better.\nMedian is the central point which divides the data into half. Quartiles are used to describe the spread of the data. The word comes from the Medieval Latin ‚Äúquartilis‚Äù which means fourth and quartiles break the data into four equal parts.\n The advantage is that they are much less effected by the outliers or skeweness of the data.   For this reason, quartiles are often used along with the median as the best measures of spread.\nThey are often expressed as an Interquartile range (IQR), which is the interval between first and third quartiles and represents 50% of the data points.\nFor example, you measured height of adults in a population, with Interquartile range you can describe a discrete interval centered around the median including 50% of the measurements.\nHere is a representative graph.[source:wikipedia]\nHow to include statistics in ggplot2\rStats make it easier to grasp the data.

But, I will create custom functions here so that we can grasp better what is happening behind the scenes on ggplot2.\nI will create one function to calculate the median and the interquartile range(IQR) 1-3, and another to calculate min(), max() values.\n In order to use the results of a function directly in ggplot2 we need to ensure that the names of the variables match the aesthetics needed for our respective geoms.   # Function for median and IQR\rmedian_IQR \u0026lt;- function(x) {\rdata.frame(y = median(x), # Median\rymin = quantile(x)[2], # 1st quartile\rymax = quantile(x)[4]) # 3rd quartile\r}\r# Function for min, max values\rrange \u0026lt;- function(x) {\rdata.frame(ymin=min(x),\rymax=max(x))\r}\rLet‚Äôs replot with the statistics we wanted to overlay. You can use two stat_summary() layers to add our stats. You can set the fun.data argument to the specific function defined above.\n# Updated plot\rp + stat_summary(geom = \u0026quot;linerange\u0026quot;,\rfun.data = median_IQR, position = posn.d, size=3) + stat_summary(geom = \u0026quot;linerange\u0026quot;, fun.data = range, position = posn.d, size=3, alpha=0.5)+ stat_summary(geom = \u0026quot;point\u0026quot;, fun.y = \u0026quot;median\u0026quot;, position = posn.d, size = 3, col = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, shape = \u0026quot;X\u0026quot;)\rIn contrast, to the first plot here we easily see where the median and IQR lays. We can make our comparisions easier. Starting from dose 20, we see that glyphosate clearly outperforms bentazone. Big separation between the IQRs are obvious at doses 40 and 80. At higher doses, differences in IQRs starts to disappear.\nConclusions\rGgplot2 is a flexible package and knowing its intricacies will help you level up your visuals. To understand your data and to convey the insights you want to point out, you can include your choice of custom functions in ggplot stat_summary() layer similarly as we did above or use the default functions.\nThe data we have here was small. With bigger data, it is more crucial to overlay summary statistics of interest for effective visuals.\nUntil next time!\nSerdar\n\r\r","date":1571184000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571217962,"objectID":"5d4fac75b4e8241c2f9554ea127b44be","permalink":"/r/stats-ggplot/","publishdate":"2019-10-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/r/stats-ggplot/","section":"post","summary":"It is hard to understand your data by looking at the numbers on a csv file.

For example cancer survival rates are much higher now. The significant portion of this increase can be attributed directly to our ability to detect and diagnose cancer earlier. Also, use of insulin and other drugs to control blood glucose in diabetic patients reduced the risk of developing coronary diseases.\nWe are at constant hunt for finding new evidence which environmental factors put us at risk for which diseases. Exposure to certain chemicals (smoking, industry workers) can cause certain types of cancer and our eating habits might put us at higher risk for developing diseases such us diabetes or liver fibrosis.\r\rFigure 1: Photo by Heather Ford on Unsplash\r\rBut not everyone who smokes develop lung cancer or who eats a lot of sugar develop fatty liver disease.

Other variables also contain zeros. Something is wrong. It is impossible to have Blood Pressure or Glucose levels at 0. It is unlikely that those are simply entry mistakes. It seems missing values are filled with zeros in the data collection phase.\nHow to circumvent this?\nConvert all zeroes to NAs and then perform Median Imputation\rMost models require numbers, and can‚Äôt handle missing data. Throwing out rows is not a good idea since it can lead to biases in your dataset and generate overconfident models.\nMedian imputation lets you model data with missing values. By replacing them with their medians.\nTo do this, I need to change zeros to missing values. I will do this for all the predictors which zero is not plausible(columns 2 to 6).\nfor(i in 2:6){\r# Convert zeros to NAs\rdiabetes[, i][diabetes[, i] == 0] \u0026lt;- NA\r# Calculate median\rmedian \u0026lt;- median(diabetes[, i], na.rm = TRUE)\rdiabetes[, i][is.na(diabetes[, i])] \u0026lt;- median\r}\rCheck if it really happened.\nknitr::kable(head(diabetes))\r\r\r\rPregnancies\r\rGlucose\r\rBloodPressure\r\rSkinThickness\r\rInsulin\r\rBMI\r\rDiabetesPedigreeFunction\r\rAge\r\rOutcome\r\r\r\r\r\r6\r\r148\r\r72\r\r35\r\r125\r\r33.6\r\r0.627\r\r50\r\r1\r\r\r\r1\r\r85\r\r66\r\r29\r\r125\r\r26.6\r\r0.351\r\r31\r\r0\r\r\r\r8\r\r183\r\r64\r\r29\r\r125\r\r23.3\r\r0.672\r\r32\r\r1\r\r\r\r1\r\r89\r\r66\r\r23\r\r94\r\r28.1\r\r0.167\r\r21\r\r0\r\r\r\r0\r\r137\r\r40\r\r35\r\r168\r\r43.1\r\r2.288\r\r33\r\r1\r\r\r\r5\r\r116\r\r74\r\r29\r\r125\r\r25.6\r\r0.201\r\r30\r\r0\r\r\r\r\rFor instance, I see that zero values in the insulin variable is replaced with median of insulin which is 125.\nI will also look at the differences between variables in diabetic versus healthy groups so that I know more which variables might play a role in the Outcome.\nI can also use dplyr functions but I will use compareGroups package because it creates a nice output of the summary statistics in a table format. compareGroups() function will do the analysis and createTable() will output it in a nice format.\nbase \u0026lt;- compareGroups(Outcome~Pregnancies+Glucose+BloodPressure+\rSkinThickness+Insulin+BMI +\rDiabetesPedigreeFunction+Age, data = diabetes)\rsummary_stats \u0026lt;- createTable(base, show.ratio = FALSE, show.p.overall=TRUE)\rsummary_stats\r## ## --------Summary descriptives table by \u0026#39;Outcome\u0026#39;---------\r## ## __________________________________________________________ ## 0 1 p.overall ## N=500 N=268 ## ¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø ## Pregnancies 3.30 (3.02) 4.87 (3.74) \u0026lt;0.001 ## Glucose 111 (24.7) 142 (29.6) \u0026lt;0.001 ## BloodPressure 70.9 (11.9) 75.1 (12.0) \u0026lt;0.001 ## SkinThickness 27.7 (8.55) 31.7 (8.66) \u0026lt;0.001 ## Insulin 128 (74.4) 165 (101) \u0026lt;0.001 ## BMI 30.9 (6.50) 35.4 (6.60) \u0026lt;0.001 ## DiabetesPedigreeFunction 0.43 (0.30) 0.55 (0.37) \u0026lt;0.001 ## Age 31.2 (11.7) 37.1 (11.0) \u0026lt;0.001 ## ¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø\rYou can see here that couple of variables are significantly higher in diabetic patients, such as Pregnancies, glucose, insulin, bmi and so on.

We have an estimate of our model performance after 1000 random train/test splits. This process is also called Monte-Carlo Cross validation. This approach might give you a less variable, but more biased estimate.\nA more common approach to estimate model performance is k-Fold cross Validation. Where the samples divided into k-folds and one fold is used as a test set, and the remaining k-1 as the training set. This process is run k times until all folds appear once in the test sample.\n\r\rLogistic regression model with k-fold Cross Validation\rI will switch here to caret package. With the Train() function we can test different types of machine learning algorithms and set the cross validation parameters.\nTo make the models below comparable I will create a custom cross validation fold object (d_folds) that I can apply to multiple models.\nI will repeat the logistic regression model with 5 fold cross validation and then we can compare it to monte carlo cross validation.\n# Convert Outcome to a factor with two levels\rdiabetes$Outcome \u0026lt;- ifelse(diabetes$Outcome == 1, \u0026quot;Yes\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;No\u0026quot;)\routcome \u0026lt;- diabetes$Outcome\rd_folds \u0026lt;- createFolds(outcome, k=5)\r# Create a dataframe without the outcome column\rdiab \u0026lt;- diabetes[,-9]\r# MyControl\rmyControl \u0026lt;- trainControl(\rsummaryFunction = twoClassSummary,\rclassProbs = TRUE,\rverboseIter = TRUE,\rsavePredictions = TRUE,\rindex = d_folds\r)\r# Model_glm\rmodel_glm \u0026lt;- train(x = diab, y = outcome,\rmetric = \u0026quot;ROC\u0026quot;,\rmethod = \u0026quot;glm\u0026quot;,\rfamily = binomial(),\rtrControl = myControl\r)\r## + Fold1: parameter=none ## - Fold1: parameter=none ## + Fold2: parameter=none ## - Fold2: parameter=none ## + Fold3: parameter=none ## - Fold3: parameter=none ## + Fold4: parameter=none ## - Fold4: parameter=none ## + Fold5: parameter=none ## - Fold5: parameter=none ## Aggregating results\r## Fitting final model on full training set\rmodel_glm\r## Generalized Linear Model ## ## 768 samples\r## 8 predictor\r## 2 classes: \u0026#39;No\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Yes\u0026#39; ## ## No pre-processing\r## Resampling: Bootstrapped (5 reps) ## Summary of sample sizes: 154, 153, 153, 154, 154 ## Resampling results:\r## ## ROC Sens Spec ## 0.8136093 0.844 0.577431\rHere, My model performance is 0.8136093\n\rGlmnet model\r# Model\rmodel_glmnet \u0026lt;- train(x = diab, y = outcome,\rmetric = \u0026quot;ROC\u0026quot;,\rmethod = \u0026quot;glmnet\u0026quot;, tuneGrid = expand.grid(\ralpha = 0:1,\rlambda = seq(0.0001, 1, length = 20)\r),\rtrControl = myControl\r)\rmodel_glmnet\r## glmnet ## ## 768 samples\r## 8 predictor\r## 2 classes: \u0026#39;No\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Yes\u0026#39; ## ## No pre-processing\r## Resampling: Bootstrapped (5 reps) ## Summary of sample sizes: 154, 153, 153, 154, 154 ## Resampling results across tuning parameters:\r## ## alpha lambda ROC Sens Spec ## 0 0.00010000 0.8201210 0.8615 0.554096935\r## 0 0.05272632 0.8227469 0.8725 0.541977831\r## 0 0.10535263 0.8239613 0.8880 0.506537709\r## 0 0.15797895 0.8242214 0.9005 0.482290806\r## 0 0.21060526 0.8240544 0.9115 0.444025212\r## 0 0.26323158 0.8238034 0.9210 0.420725929\r## 0 0.31585789 0.8233937 0.9290 0.395548794\r## 0 0.36848421 0.8230260 0.9365 0.357313627\r## 0 0.42111053 0.8228119 0.9430 0.331201913\r## 0 0.47373684 0.8224972 0.9505 0.306955010\r## 0 0.52636316 0.8222639 0.9575 0.276166051\r## 0 0.57898947 0.8220894 0.9615 0.254705499\r## 0 0.63161579 0.8219008 0.9670 0.238852423\r## 0 0.68424211 0.8217353 0.9690 0.217396218\r## 0 0.73686842 0.8215489 0.9705 0.200604216\r## 0 0.78949474 0.8214394 0.9725 0.178235166\r## 0 0.84212105 0.8212995 0.9755 0.157704847\r## 0 0.89474737 0.8210990 0.9785 0.138109107\r## 0 0.94737368 0.8209896 0.9800 0.125976962\r## 0 1.00000000 0.8208614 0.9805 0.111980004\r## 1 0.00010000 0.8141708 0.8450 0.575553141\r## 1 0.05272632 0.8232373 0.9040 0.505646599\r## 1 0.10535263 0.8064789 0.9490 0.348028689\r## 1 0.15797895 0.7982626 0.9865 0.118687242\r## 1 0.21060526 0.7913587 0.9995 0.002803738\r## 1 0.26323158 0.5552114 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.31585789 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.36848421 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.42111053 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.47373684 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.52636316 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.57898947 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.63161579 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.68424211 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.73686842 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.78949474 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.84212105 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.89474737 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.94737368 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 1.00000000 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## ## ROC was used to select the optimal model using the largest value.\r## The final values used for the model were alpha = 0 and lambda = 0.1579789.\rplot(model_glmnet)\rAs we see in the plot, ridge regression (alpha = 0) performed better than the lasso at all lambda values.\nGlmnet model performance is 0.8242214\n\rRandom forest model\rOne of the big diferences between random forest and linear models is that they require ‚Äútuning.‚Äù\nHyperparameters ‚Äì\u0026gt; How the model is fit.

Hard part is done. Now, I can identify how many rhymes each poem contains, word usage across different poems, the similarities between them and many more to gain insights about the author.\nI could also analyze the whole book as a single document but by isolating each element I will gain much deeper insight from the data.\nDo you apply similar techniques to isolate chapters or sections from the book or documents to compare and contrast different parts?\nThank you for reading this post.

Some people write by day, others by night. Some people need silence, others turn on the radio. Some write by hand, some by computer, some by talking into a tape recorder. Some people write their first draft in one long burst and then revise; others can‚Äôt write the second paragraph until they have fiddled endlessly with the first.\nYellow highlight | Location: 154\rUltimately the product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is. I often find myself reading with interest about a topic I never thought would interest me‚Äîsome scientific quest, perhaps. What holds me is the enthusiasm of the writer for his field. How was he drawn into it? What emotional baggage did he bring along? How did it change his life?

It‚Äôs the common currency of newspapers and of magazines like People‚Äîa mixture of cheap words, made-up words and clich√©s that have become so pervasive that a writer can hardly help using them. You must fight these phrases or you‚Äôll sound like every hack.\nBlue highlight | Location: 512\rWhat is ‚Äújournalese‚Äù? It‚Äôs a quilt of instant words patched together out of other parts of speech. Adjectives are used as nouns (‚Äúgreats,‚Äù ‚Äúnotables‚Äù).

You‚Äôll find ruffians and riffraff, miscreants and malefactors, reprobates and rapscallions, hooligans and hoodlums, scamps and scapegraces, scoundrels and scalawags, jezebels and jades. You‚Äôll find adjectives to fit them all (foul and fiendish, devilish and diabolical), and adverbs and verbs to describe how the wrongdoers do their wrong, and cross-references leading to still other thickets of venality and vice. Still, there‚Äôs no better friend to have around to nudge the memory than Roget. It saves you the time of rummaging in your brain‚Äîthat network of overloaded grooves‚Äîto find the word that‚Äôs right on the tip of your tongue, where it doesn‚Äôt do you any good. The Thesaurus is to the writer\nBlue highlight | Location: 553\rwhat a rhyming dictionary is to the songwriter‚Äîa reminder of all the choices‚Äîand you should use it with gratitude.

It may be a problem of where to obtain the facts or how to organize the material. It may be a problem of approach or attitude, tone or style. Whatever it is, it has to be confronted and solved. Sometimes you will despair of finding the right solution‚Äîor any solution. You‚Äôll think, ‚ÄúIf I live to be ninety I‚Äôll never get out of this mess.‚Äù I‚Äôve often thought it myself.

Then they learned that it wasn‚Äôt. But they were still pretty sure the sun revolved around the Earth¬†‚Ä¶¬†until that theory went bust, too. For an even longer period of time, smart people have believed story is just a form of entertainment. They‚Äôve thought that beyond the immense pleasure it bestows‚Äîthe ephemeral joy and deep sense of satisfaction a good story leaves us with‚Äîstory itself serves no necessary purpose. Sure, our lives from time immemorial would have been far drabber without it, but we‚Äôd have survived just fine.

Because the ease with which we surrender to the stories we read tends to cloud our understanding of stories we write.\nYellow highlight | Page: 4\rEvolution dictates that the first job of any good story is to completely anesthetize the part of our brain that questions how it is creating such a compelling illusion of reality.\nYellow highlight | Page: 4\rSo it‚Äôs no surprise that we tend to be utterly oblivious to the fact that beneath every captivating story, there is an intricate mesh of interconnected elements holding it together, allowing it to build with seemingly effortless precision. This often fools us into thinking we know exactly what has us hooked‚Äîthings like beautiful metaphors, authentic-sounding dialogue, an interesting character‚Äîwhen, in fact, despite how engaging those things appear to be in and of themselves, it turns out they‚Äôre secondary. What has us hooked is something else altogether, something that underlies them, secretly bringing them to life: story, as our brain understands it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 6\rIt‚Äôs simple. Your brain, along with every other living organism down to the humble amoeba, has one main goal: survival.\nYellow highlight | Page: 6\rYour subconscious brain‚Äîwhich neuroscientists refer to as the adaptive or cognitive unconscious‚Äîis a finely tuned instrument, instantly aware of what matters, what doesn‚Äôt, why, and, hopefully, what you should do about it.2 It knows you don‚Äôt have the time to think,\nYellow highlight | Page: 6\r‚ÄúGee, what‚Äôs that loud noise?

Here‚Äôs how neuroscientist Antonio Damasio sums it up: ‚ÄúThe problem of how to make all this wisdom understandable, transmissible, persuasive, enforceable‚Äîin a word, of how to make it stick‚Äîwas faced and a solution found.

It‚Äôs hardwired in our brain. It‚Äôs how we make strategic sense of the otherwise overwhelming world around us. Simply put, the brain constantly seeks meaning from all the input thrown at it, yanks out what‚Äôs important for our survival on a need-to-know basis, and tells us a story about it, based on what it knows of our past experience with it, how we feel about it, and how it might affect us. Rather than recording everything on a first come, first served basis, our brain casts us as ‚Äúthe protagonist‚Äù and then edits our experience with cinema-like precision, creating logical interrelations, mapping connections between memories, ideas, and events for future reference.\nYellow highlight | Page: 8\rStory is the language of experience,\nYellow highlight | Page: 9\rStory evolved as a way to explore our own mind and the minds of others, as a sort of dress rehearsal for the future.\nYellow highlight | Page: 9\rAs a result, story helps us survive not only in the life-and-death physical sense but also in a life-well-lived social sense.\nYellow highlight | Page: 9\rFictional narratives supply us with a mental catalogue of the fatal conundrums we might face someday and the outcomes of strategies we could deploy in them.\nYellow highlight | Page: 10\rNot only do we crave story, but we have very specific hardwired expectations for every story we read,\nNote:Story‚Äôs ability to help us safely navigate in daily life.\nYellow highlight | Page: 10\rThe real answer is rather counterintuitive: our expectations have everything to do with the story‚Äôs ability to provide information on how we might safely navigate this earthly plane.\nYellow highlight | Page: 10\rWhen a story meets our brain‚Äôs criteria, we relax and slip into the protagonist‚Äôs skin, eager to experience what his or her struggle feels like, without having to leave the comfort of home.\nYellow highlight | Page: 11\rSo what is a story? A story is how what happens affects someone who is trying to achieve what turns out to be a difficult goal, and how he or she changes as a result. Breaking it down in the soothingly familiar parlance of the writing world, this translates to\nNote:What is a story\nYellow highlight | Page: 11\rThe ‚Äúgoal‚Äù is what‚Äôs known as the story question.\nYellow highlight | Page: 11\rAs counterintuitive as it may sound, a story is not about the plot or even what happens in it. Stories are about how we, rather than the world around us, change. They grab us only when they allow us to experience how it would feel to navigate the plot. Thus story, as we‚Äôll see throughout, is an internal journey, not an external one.\nNote:***** how we change is what matters in the story\nYellow highlight | Page: 12\rAll the elements of a story are anchored in this very simple premise, and they work in unison to create what appears to the reader as reality, only sharper, clearer, and far more entertaining, because stories do what our cognitive unconscious does: filter out everything that would distract us from the situation at hand.\nYellow highlight | Page: 12\rLet‚Äôs face it, we‚Äôre all busy.

This is because, by definition, they start with something writers often never even think about‚Äîthe point their story will make.\nYellow highlight | Page: 23\rArmed with that knowledge, they then craft a tale in which every word, every image, every nuance leads directly to it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 25\rThus your first job is to zero in on the point your story is making.\nYellow highlight | Page: 25\rA story is designed, from beginning to end, to answer a single overarching question. As readers we instinctively know this, so we expect every word, every line, every character, every image, every action to move us closer to the answer.\nYellow highlight | Page: 26\rAs one editor put it, ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt summarize your book in a few sentences, rewrite the book until you can.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 26\rWe have no idea who the protagonist is, so we have no way to gauge the relevance or meaning of anything that happens.\nYellow highlight | Page: 26\rWe know who the protagonist is, but she doesn‚Äôt seem to have a goal, so we\nYellow highlight | Page: 26\rdon‚Äôt know what the point is or where the story is going.\nYellow highlight | Page: 26\rWe know what the protagonist‚Äôs goal is, but have no clue what inner issue it forces him to deal with, so everything feels superficial and rather dull.\nYellow highlight | Page: 26\rWe know who the protagonist is and what both her goal and her issue are, but suddenly she gets what she wants, arbitrarily changes her mind, or gets hit by a bus, and now someone else seems to be the main character. ‚Ä¢ We‚Äôre aware of the protagonist‚Äôs goal, but what happens doesn‚Äôt seem to affect him or whether he achieves it. ‚Ä¢ The things that happen don‚Äôt affect the protagonist in a believable way (if at all), so not only doesn‚Äôt she seem like a real person, but we have no idea why she does what she does, which makes it impossible to anticipate what she‚Äôll do next.\nYellow highlight | Page: 27\rWhat was missing in all those failed manuscripts is focus. Without it, the reader has no way to gauge the meaning of anything, and since we‚Äôre wired to hunt for meaning in everything‚Äîwell, you do the math.\nYellow highlight | Page: 27\rThe story isn‚Äôt about whether or not the protagonist achieves her goal per se; it‚Äôs about what she has to overcome internally to do it. This is what drives the story forward. I call it the protagonist‚Äôs issue.\nYellow highlight | Page: 27\rThe second element, the theme, is what your story says about human nature.\nYellow highlight | Page: 27\rTheme tends to be reflected in how your characters treat each other, so it defines what is possible and what isn‚Äôt in the world the story unfolds in.\nYellow highlight | Page: 28\rThe third element is the plot itself‚Äîthe events that relentlessly force the protagonist to deal with her issue as she pursues her goal, no matter how many times she tries to make an end run around her issue along the way.\nYellow highlight | Page: 28\r‚Äúminds exist to predict what will happen next.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 28\rWe love to figure things out and we don‚Äôt like being confused.\nYellow highlight | Page: 28\ra concrete frame of reference against which everything that happens is measured.\nNote:how brain works\nYellow highlight | Page: 29\rAll of these contents are inextricably tied to a singular reference.\nYellow highlight | Page: 29\rWhat does the story tell us about what it means to be human? ‚Ä¢ What does it say about how humans react to circumstances beyond their control?\nYellow highlight | Page: 30\rBut the real secret to theme is that it‚Äôs not general; that is, the theme wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúlove‚Äù per se‚Äîrather, it would be a very specific point you‚Äôre making about love. For instance, a love story can be sweet and lyrical, revealing that people are good eggs after all; it can be hard-nosed and edgy, revealing that people are intense and quirky; it can be cynical and manipulative, revealing that people are best avoided, if possible.\nYellow highlight | Page: 30\rKnowing the theme of your story in advance helps, because it gives you a gauge by which to measure your characters‚Äô responses to the situations they find themselves in.\nYellow highlight | Page: 30\rAs corporate consultants Richard Maxwell and Robert Dickman say in their book The Elements of Persuasion, ‚ÄúFor those of us whose business depends on being able to persuade others‚Äîwhich is all of us in business‚Äîthe key to survival is being able to cut through all the clutter and make the sale.

What point does my story make? How do I want to change the way my reader sees the world?\nYellow highlight | Page: 33\rThus we have a bird‚Äôs-eye view of the battle between the protagonist and the plot,\nYellow highlight | Page: 34\rShe was glad she had never left Henry. She‚Äôd never had a friend as loyal, as kind, as her husband. And yet, standing behind her son, waiting for the traffic light to change, she remembered how in the midst of it all there had been times when she‚Äôd felt a loneliness so deep that once, not so many years ago, having a cavity filled, the dentist‚Äôs gentle turning of her chin with his soft fingers had felt to her like a tender kindness of almost excruciating depth, and she had swallowed with a groan of longing, tears springing to her eyes.11 In that very specific memory‚Äîthe dentist‚Äôs fleeting, workaday touch‚Äîan otherwise ineffable feeling of existential loneliness is made manifest, as palpable as if it had happened to us‚Äîbecause, as we‚Äôll see in chapter 4, as far as our brain is concerned, it actually has. By filtering her story through the thematic lens of loss and human endurance, Strout was able to pluck an otherwise random moment from Olive‚Äôs life and use it to give us insight into how Olive sees the world, and at the same time provide a visceral glimpse of the cost of being human.\nYellow highlight | Page: 34\rTheme and Tone: It‚Äôs Not What You Say but How You Say It\nYellow highlight | Page: 35\rUnchecked, theme is a bully, a know-it-all.

Here‚Äôs the litmus test: the central theme must provide a point of view precise enough to give us specific insight into the protagonist and her internal issue, yet be broad enough to take into account everything that happens (again: the plot).\nYellow highlight | Page: 39\ris it possible to filter the story‚Äôs other themes through it?\nYellow highlight | Page: 39\rIn Gone with the Wind, Scarlett‚Äôs gumption came first, so‚Äîfor better or worse‚Äîit affects everything else: her love life, her refusal to be constrained by the mores of the day, and her insatiable need to take action when she doesn‚Äôt get what she wants. Take action? Ah yes, the plot.\nYellow highlight | Page: 39\rAs we know, it‚Äôs the plot that puts the protagonist through his paces, presenting increasingly difficult obstacles that must be overcome if he‚Äôs to get within grabbing distance of the brass ring.\nYellow highlight | Page: 39\rBut the plot‚Äôs goal isn‚Äôt simply to find out whether he snags that brass ring or not; rather, it‚Äôs to force him to confront the internal issue that‚Äôs keeping him from it in the first place. This issue is sometimes called the protagonist‚Äôs ‚Äúfatal flaw,‚Äù and whether a deep-rooted fear, a stubborn misperception, or a dubious character trait, it‚Äôs what he‚Äôs been battling throughout and what he must finally overcome to have a clear shot at the last remaining obstacle.\nYellow highlight | Page: 39\rIronically, once he overcomes it, he often realizes true success is vastly different from what, up to that very second, he thought it was.\nYellow highlight | Page: 40\rWhat does Scarlett need in order to feel she‚Äôs survived what life has thrown at her?\nYellow highlight | Page: 40\rThe answer is her family‚Äôs plantation, Tara. Meaning, land. As her father tells her early on, ‚ÄúLand is the only thing in the world that amounts to anything.‚Ä¶‚Äù Land is what ties you to your past and makes you who you are. Without it, you are nothing. This becomes Scarlett‚Äôs benchmark, the thing that she‚Äôs sure will prove she‚Äôs survived.\nYellow highlight | Page: 41\rReaders are a surprisingly accepting lot when it comes to willfully blind protagonists, provided they understand the reason for their blindness.\nYellow highlight | Page: 42\rKnowing what the focus of your story is allows you to do for your story what your cognitive unconscious does for you: filter out everything extraneous, everything that doesn‚Äôt matter.\nYellow highlight | Page: 43\rDo you know what the point of your story is?

What is your story saying?\nYellow highlight | Page: 44\rDo the protagonist‚Äôs inner issue, the theme, and the plot work together to answer the story question?\nYellow highlight | Page: 44\rIs my theme reflected in the way the world treats my protagonist?\nYellow highlight | Page: 44\rRemember, the story question will always be in the back of your reader‚Äôs mind, and it is the responsibility of each theme-laced event to keep it there.\nYellow highlight | Page: 44\rCan you sum up what your story is about in a short paragraph?\nYellow highlight | Page: 46\rTurns out, as cognitive scientist Steven Pinker notes, ‚ÄúEmotions are mechanisms that set the brain‚Äôs highest-level goals.‚Äù3\nYellow highlight | Page: 47\rI saw the world through Linda Seton‚Äôs eyes.

But as we‚Äôve learned, the real story is how what happens affects the protagonist, and what she does as a result.\nYellow highlight | Page: 47\rAnd guess what? Neutrality bores the reader. If it‚Äôs neutral, it‚Äôs not only beside the point, it detracts from it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 47\rprotagonist must react in a way the reader can see and understand in the moment. This reaction must be specific, personal, and have an effect on whether the protagonist achieves her goal.\nYellow highlight | Page: 47\reverything we experience is automatically coated in emotion. Why? It‚Äôs our version of a computer‚Äôs ones and zeros, and it‚Äôs based on a single question: Will it hurt me, or will it help me?\nYellow highlight | Page: 47\rThis humble equation underlies every aspect of our rich, elegant, complex, and ever-changing sense of self, and how we experience the world around us. According to Damasio, ‚ÄúNo set of conscious images of any kind on any topic ever fails to be accompanied by an obedient choir of emotions and consequent feelings.‚Äù5 If we‚Äôre not feeling, we‚Äôre not breathing. A neutral protagonist is an automaton.\nYellow highlight | Page: 48\rIt is the protagonist‚Äôs story, after all, so we evaluate everyone and everything else based on how they affect him. Because ultimately what moves a story forward are the protagonist‚Äôs actions, reactions, and decisions, rather than the external events that trigger them.\nYellow highlight | Page: 49\rThis is what gives narrative story its unique power.

And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others, because we can‚Äôt readily re-create our listeners‚Äô state of mind.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 63\rThat‚Äôs why it‚Äôs always helpful to have Mark Twain‚Äôs pithy observation close at hand: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no wonder that truth is stranger than fiction.

Truth is, agenda is just another word for goal‚Äîmaking it completely neutral and utterly necessary to survival.\nYellow highlight | Page: 65\rIn fact, Steven Pinker defines intelligent life as ‚Äúusing knowledge of how things work to attain goals in the face of obstacles.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 65\rthe most common obstacle in both life and story is figuring out what other people really mean.\nYellow highlight | Page: 67\rMirror neurons allow us to feel what others experience almost as if it were happening to us, the better to infer what ‚Äúothers know in order to explain their desires and intentions with real precision.‚Äù4 But here‚Äôs the kicker.

His external goal is to get out of Bedford Falls and build bridges, skyscrapers, and to ‚Äúdo big things.‚Äù He believes these goals are one and the same. The movie then chronicles how his external goal is thwarted at every turn, and instead of doing big things, he always does the right thing. In the end, that‚Äôs precisely how he achieves his internal goal‚Äîmaking a big difference in many people‚Äôs lives‚Äîwhich brings with it the realization that he actually achieved his external goal as well. He did do big things‚Äîthings that are far more important and enduring than building skyscrapers. Thus, by achieving his internal goal, he was able to redefine his external goal‚Äîand, happily, discover that he‚Äôd already accomplished it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 74\rBut up to that moment, George fully believed that only by achieving his external goal would his internal goal be met. And as real life makes all too clear, this is rarely the case.\nYellow highlight | Page: 75\rBy defining your protagonist‚Äôs internal and external goals, and then pitting them against each other, you can often ignite the kind of external tension and internal conflict capable of driving an entire narrative.\nYellow highlight | Page: 75\rinternal obstacles‚Äîusually in the form of longstanding emotional and psychological barriers‚Äîthat are forever holding her back.

And remember, scenery without subtext is a travelogue.\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rTHE BRAIN DOESN‚ÄôT LIKE CHANGE. Would you, if you‚Äôd spent millions of years evolving with the sole goal of maintaining a constant, stable equilibrium?\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rmasterful spin doctors, rationalizers, and justifiers of threatening information and go to great lengths to maintain a sense of well-being.‚Äù3\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rWe don‚Äôt like change, and we don‚Äôt like conflict, either. So most of the time we do our best to avoid both. This isn‚Äôt easy, since the only real constant is change, and change is driven by conflict. This or that? Me or you? Chocolate or vanilla?\nYellow highlight | Page: 126\rAnd there‚Äôs the paradox: we survived because we‚Äôre risk takers, but our goal is to stay safe by not changing an iota unless we absolutely have to. Talk about conflict! And that brings us right back to story. Story‚Äôs job is to tackle exactly how we handle that conflict, which boils down to this: the battle between fear and desire.\nYellow highlight | Page: 127\rIndeed, it ripples through the story in the guise of mounting tension, engendering in the reader that delicious dopamine-driven sensation we‚Äôre addicted to when it comes to a good tale: suspense, the desire to find out what‚Äôs really going on.\nYellow highlight | Page: 127\ra recent study using magnetic resonance imaging revealed that intense social rejection activates the same areas in the brain that physical pain does.\nYellow highlight | Page: 128\rasked him how he felt about conflict in his real life.

So, although we feel Juliet‚Äôs anguish on awaking to find Romeo lifeless by her side, we never once lose sight of the fact that our own beloved is, in fact, snoring peacefully in the theater seat next to us. And that, my friends, is what makes stories so deeply satisfying. We get to try on trouble, pretty much risk-free.\nYellow highlight | Page: 129\rAnd so in literature, not as in life, the goal is to embrace conflict and harness it to suspense. Now, for the sixty-four-thousand-dollar question: how do you translate impending conflict into ongoing suspense?\nYellow highlight | Page: 144\rAntonio Damasio:\nYellow highlight | Page: 146\rKathryn Schulz of Being Wrong attests: ‚ÄúWe think this one thing is going to happen, and something else happens instead.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 146\rwe‚Äôll take a look at why ‚Äúshow, don‚Äôt tell‚Äù is a matter of why rather than what; and we‚Äôll introduce the all-important ‚ÄúAnd so?‚Äù test to guarantee that neither cause-and-effect trajectory ever goes off the rails.\nYellow highlight | Page: 146\rAs we know, both life and story are driven by emotion, but what they‚Äôre ordered by is logic.\nYellow highlight | Page: 152\rSince stories are about how what happens affects someone‚ÄîJoe, for instance‚Äîthe reason he popped the balloon is more important than the fact that he popped it.

As my classmate took a full swing, the bat slipped out of his hands and came flying toward me before striking me directly between the eyes. I have no memory of the moment of impact.\nPink highlight | Location: 134\rI built good sleep habits and went to bed early each night. In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to keep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confident again.\nPink highlight | Location: 137\rA habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly‚Äîand, in many cases, automatically. As each semester passed, I accumulated small but consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to me when I started.\nPink highlight | Location: 150\rchanges that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you‚Äôre willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often\nPink highlight | Location: 151\rdepends on the quality of our habits.1 With the same habits, you‚Äôll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.\nPink highlight | Location: 160\rI began by publishing a new article every Monday and Thursday. Within a few months, this simple writing habit led to my first one thousand email subscribers, and by the end of 2013 that number had grown to more than thirty thousand people.\nPink highlight | Location: 165\rIn 2015, I reached two hundred thousand email subscribers and signed a book deal with Penguin Random House to begin writing the book you are reading now. As my audience grew, so did my business opportunities. I was increasingly asked to speak at top companies about the science of habit formation, behavior\nPink highlight | Location: 167\rchange, and continuous improvement. I found myself delivering keynote speeches at conferences in the United States and Europe.\nPink highlight | Location: 178\rThe entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, ‚ÄúTo write a great book, you must first become the book.‚Äù\nPink highlight | Location: 186\rThe fields I draw on‚Äîbiology, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, and more‚Äîhave been around for many years. What I offer you is a synthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out a long time ago as well as the most compelling discoveries scientists have made recently.\nPink highlight | Location: 188\rMy contribution, I hope, is to find the ideas that matter most and connect them in a way that is highly actionable. Anything wise in these pages you should credit to the many experts who preceded me. Anything foolish, assume it is my error.\nPink highlight | Location: 195\rBehavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you offered the right reward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain way. But while Skinner‚Äôs model did an excellent job of explaining how external stimuli influenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior. Internal states‚Äîour moods and emotions‚Äîmatter, too. In recent decades, scientists have begun to determine the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behavior. This research will also be covered in these pages.\nOrange highlight | Location: 246\rWHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE\nPink highlight | Location: 247\rIt is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.\nPink highlight | Location: 248\rToo often, we convince ourselves that massive success\nPink highlight | Location: 248\rrequires massive action.\nYellow highlight | Location: 249\rWhether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.\nOrange highlight | Location: 250\rMeanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn‚Äôt particularly notable‚Äîsometimes it isn‚Äôt even noticeable‚Äîbut it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here‚Äôs how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you‚Äôll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you‚Äôre done.12 Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you‚Äôll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.\nYellow highlight | Location: 259\rHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement.13\nOrange highlight | Location: 260\rThe same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.\nOrange highlight | Location: 277\rSimilarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination.\nOrange highlight | Location: 279\rSuccess is the product of daily habits‚Äînot once-in-a-lifetime transformations.\nOrange highlight | Location: 284\rYour outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of\nOrange highlight | Location: 285\ryour eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.\nOrange highlight | Location: 287\rIf you want to predict where you‚Äôll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line.\nYellow highlight | Location: 288\rAre you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self.\nBlue highlight | Location: 290\rTime magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.\nYellow highlight | Location: 319\rThe ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change. Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This pattern\nBlue highlight | Location: 321\rshows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months.18 Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.\nYellow highlight | Location: 324\rSimilarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.\nYellow highlight | Location: 335\rWhen you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. The outside\nYellow highlight | Location: 354\rAll big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision.\nYellow highlight | Location: 360\rFORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD\nYellow highlight | Location: 365\rbegan to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.\nYellow highlight | Location: 367\rGoals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.\nYellow highlight | Location: 379\rlife. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.\nYellow highlight | Location: 381\rprogress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.\nYellow highlight | Location: 383\rGoal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias.\nYellow highlight | Location: 395\rAchieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That‚Äôs the counterintuitive thing about improvement.\nYellow highlight | Location: 397\rWhen you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.\nYellow highlight | Location: 400\rThe implicit assumption behind any goal is this: ‚ÄúOnce I reach my goal, then I‚Äôll be happy.‚Äù The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you‚Äôre continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.\nYellow highlight | Location: 404\rFurthermore, goals create an ‚Äúeither-or‚Äù conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness.\nYellow highlight | Location: 407\rA systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don‚Äôt have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.\nYellow highlight | Location: 414\rThe purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It‚Äôs not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.\nYellow highlight | Location: 420\rYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.\nYellow highlight | Location: 442\rFew things can have a more powerful impact on your life than improving your daily habits.\nYellow highlight | Location: 448\rChanging our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.\nYellow highlight | Location: 459\rThe third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.\nBlue highlight | Location: 461\rOutcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.\nBlue highlight | Location: 464\rMany people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.\nBlue highlight | Location: 470\rImagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says,\nBlue highlight | Location: 470\r‚ÄúNo thanks. I‚Äôm trying to quit.‚Äù It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs. The second person declines by saying, ‚ÄúNo thanks. I‚Äôm not a smoker.‚Äù It‚Äôs a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who smokes.\nBlue highlight | Location: 474\rMost people don‚Äôt even consider identity change when they set out to improve. They just think, ‚ÄúI want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I‚Äôll be skinny (process).‚Äù They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don‚Äôt realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change.\nBlue highlight | Location: 483\rBehavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.\nBlue highlight | Location: 486\rhard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven‚Äôt changed who you are.\nBlue highlight | Location: 497\rThe ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It‚Äôs one thing to say I‚Äôm the type of person who wants this. It‚Äôs something very different to say I‚Äôm the type of person who is this.\nYellow highlight | Location: 499\rThe more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.\nYellow highlight | Location: 502\rOnce your pride gets involved, you‚Äôll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.\nYellow highlight | Location: 505\rImprovements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.\nYellow highlight | Location: 506\rThe goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. ‚ñ† The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. ‚ñ† The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.\nBlue highlight | Location: 510\rYour behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are‚Äîeither consciously or nonconsciously.fn1\nBlue highlight | Location: 515\rthemselves to train. Doing the right thing is easy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.\nBlue highlight | Location: 528\rWhen you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact.\nBlue highlight | Location: 537\rProgress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.\nBlue highlight | Location: 542\rYour identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.fn2 More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person.\nBlue highlight | Location: 546\rThe more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your ‚Äúrepeated beingness.‚Äù\nBlue highlight | Location: 557\rEach experience in life modifies your self-image, but it‚Äôs unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change.\nBlue highlight | Location: 561\rIn this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.\nBlue highlight | Location: 561\rThis is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit.6 We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.\nBlue highlight | Location: 566\rEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change.\nBlue highlight | Location: 568\rSmall habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That‚Äôs the paradox of making small improvements. Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.\nBlue highlight | Location: 576\rEach habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things.\nBlue highlight | Location: 577\rWhen the votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.\nBlue highlight | Location: 583\rIt is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.\nBlue highlight | Location: 591\rFor example, ‚ÄúWho is the type of person who could write a book?‚Äù It‚Äôs probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus shifts from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is consistent and reliable (identity-based).\nBlue highlight | Location: 598\rOnce you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity.\nBlue highlight | Location: 600\rShe figured if she acted like a healthy person long enough, eventually she would become that person. She was right.\nBlue highlight | Location: 604\rThe focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.\nBlue highlight | Location: 606\rIdentity change is the North Star of habit change.\nBlue highlight | Location: 608\r‚ÄúAre you becoming the type of person you want to become?‚Äù The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder. And that‚Äôs why we are starting here.\nBlue highlight | Location: 610\rYou have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You can\nBlue highlight | Location: 611\rchoose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. And this brings us to the deeper purpose of this book and the real reason habits matter.\nBlue highlight | Location: 619\r‚ñ† There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.\nBlue highlight | Location: 621\rThe most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.\nBlue highlight | Location: 622\rYour identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.\nBlue highlight | Location: 624\rBecoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.\nBlue highlight | Location: 625\rThe real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.\nBlue highlight | Location: 649\rA habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.\nBlue highlight | Location: 650\rThe process of habit formation begins with trial and error. Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you come across a problem, you‚Äôre not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndike‚Äôs cat, you‚Äôre just trying things out to see what works.\nBlue highlight | Location: 663\rAs behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, ‚ÄúHabits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.‚Äù\nBlue highlight | Location: 670\rHabits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution. The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.7\nBlue highlight | Location: 677\rHabits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.\nBlue highlight | Location: 682\rHabits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In\nBlue highlight | Location: 697\rFirst, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex.\nYellow highlight | Location: 703\rCravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire‚Äîwithout craving a change‚Äîwe have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides. You are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth. You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be entertained. Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later.\nYellow highlight | Location: 709\rFor someone who rarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are just background noise. Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.\nYellow highlight | Location: 716\rhabit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.\nYellow highlight | Location: 721\rSecond, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones.11 Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.\nYellow highlight | Location: 745\rAll behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you face.\nYellow highlight | Location: 785\rThe ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. ‚ñ† Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.\nYellow highlight | Location: 788\rThe Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.\nPink highlight | Location: 813\rThe human brain is a prediction machine.5 It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes\nPink highlight | Location: 814\racross. Whenever you experience something repeatedly‚Äîlike a paramedic seeing the face of a heart attack patient or a military analyst seeing a missile on a radar screen‚Äîyour brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use.\nPink highlight | Location: 845\rit. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, ‚ÄúUntil you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 856\rPointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent.10 The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is ‚Äúpoint-only,‚Äù and ‚Äúwithin two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.‚Äù11\nYellow highlight | Location: 861\rMy wife does something similar. Whenever we are preparing to walk out the door for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essential items in her packing list. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got my keys. I‚Äôve got my wallet. I‚Äôve got my glasses. I‚Äôve got my husband.‚Äù\nPink highlight | Location: 911\rThe first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them.\nPink highlight | Location: 925\rThe process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.\nYellow highlight | Location: 980\rGive your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can‚Äôt say why. As the writer Jason Zweig noted, ‚ÄúObviously you‚Äôre never going to just work out without conscious thought.9 But like a dog salivating at a bell, maybe you start to get antsy around the time of day you normally\nYellow highlight | Location: 984\rwork out.‚Äù\nPink highlight | Location: 1,009\rWhen it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,032\rAfter I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty seconds. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for the day. After I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin my first task.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,094\rThe 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious. ‚ñ† The two most common cues are time and location. ‚ñ† Creating an implementation\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,097\rintention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location. ‚ñ† The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. ‚ñ† Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit. ‚ñ† The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,118\rPeople often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are.2 If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of cookies on the counter, I‚Äôll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn‚Äôt been thinking about them beforehand and didn‚Äôt necessarily feel hungry.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,126\rIn 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E).3 It didn‚Äôt take long\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,132\rFor example, items at eye level tend to be purchased more than those down near the floor.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,136\rThe more obviously available a product or service is, the more likely you are to try it.

The trigger is rarely a single cue, but rather the whole situation: watching your friends order drinks, hearing the music at the bar, seeing the beers on tap.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,196\rWe mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur: the home, the office, the gym. Each location develops a connection to certain habits and routines. You establish a particular relationship with the objects on your desk, the items on your kitchen counter, the things in your bedroom.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,198\rOur behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,199\rStop thinking about your environment as filled with objects.

Junk food, for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. After spending hundreds of thousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the wild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value on salt, sugar, and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and they were quite rare when our ancient ancestors were roaming the savannah. When you don‚Äôt know where your next meal is coming from, eating as much as possible is an excellent strategy for survival.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,377\rToday, however, we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food is abundant, but your brain continues to crave it like it is scarce. Placing a high value on salt, sugar, and fat is no longer advantageous to our health, but the craving persists because the brain‚Äôs reward centers have not changed for approximately fifty thousand years. The modern food industry relies on stretching our Paleolithic instincts beyond their evolutionary purpose.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,384\rEntire departments are dedicated to optimizing how a product feels in your mouth‚Äîa quality known as orosensation. French fries, for example, are a potent combination‚Äîgolden brown and crunchy on the outside, light and smooth on the inside.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,389\rBut foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep the experience novel and interesting, encouraging you to eat more.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,393\rStephan Guyenet, a neuroscientist who specializes in eating behavior and obesity, says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gotten too good at pushing our own buttons.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,395\rThe modern food industry, and the overeating habits it has spawned, is just one example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: Make it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,397\rLook around. Society is filled with highly engineered versions of reality that are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in. Stores feature mannequins with exaggerated hips and breasts to sell clothes. Social media delivers more ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and praise in a few minutes than we could ever get in the office or at home.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,400\rAdvertisements are created with a combination of ideal lighting, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits‚Äîeven the model doesn‚Äôt look like the person in the final image. These are the supernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate features that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result, driving us into excessive shopping habits, social media habits, porn habits, eating habits, and many others.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,406\rCompared to nature, these pleasure-packed experiences are hard to resist. We have the brains of our ancestors but temptations they never had to face.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,408\rWhile it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by understanding what a craving is and how it works. We begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share‚Äîthe dopamine spike.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,412\rScientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring a neurotransmitter called dopamine.fn1\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,421\rEven though dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn‚Äôt want it anymore. The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped.11\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,424\rIn one study, mice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time they poked their nose in a box. Within minutes, the mice developed a craving so\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,425\rstrong they began poking their nose into the box eight hundred times per hour.12 (Humans are not so different: the average slot machine player will spin the wheel six hundred times per hour.13)\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,428\rHabits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop.14 Every behavior that is highly habit-forming‚Äîtaking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social media‚Äîis associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,431\rFor years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary movement.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,433\rdopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,436\rWhenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,438\rIt is the anticipation of a reward‚Äînot the fulfillment of it‚Äîthat gets us to take action.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,439\rInterestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward.18 This is one reason the anticipation of an experience can often feel better than the attainment of it. As a child, thinking about Christmas morning can be better than opening the gifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more enjoyable than actually being on vacation. Scientists refer to this as the difference between ‚Äúwanting‚Äù and ‚Äúliking.‚Äù\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,459\rYour brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,459\rThe wanting centers in the brain are large: the brain stem, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal striatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal cortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are much smaller. They are often referred to as ‚Äúhedonic hot spots‚Äù and are distributed like tiny islands throughout the brain. For instance, researchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens is activated during wanting.19 Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is activated during liking.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,464\rThe fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,465\rof the crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response. These insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change. We need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the first place. This is where a strategy known as temptation bundling comes into play.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,493\rTemptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as Premack‚Äôs Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that ‚Äúmore probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.‚Äù23 In other words, even if you don‚Äôt really want to process overdue work emails, you‚Äôll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do something you really want to do along the way.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,501\rAfter I get my morning coffee, I will say one thing I‚Äôm grateful for that happened yesterday (need).

The powerful.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,570\rWe pick up habits from the people around us. We copy the way our parents handle arguments, the way our peers flirt with one another, the way our coworkers get results. When your friends smoke pot, you give it a try, too. When your wife has a habit of double-checking that the door is locked before going to bed, you pick it up as well.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,585\rOne of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. New habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every day. If you are surrounded by fit people, you‚Äôre more likely to consider working out to be a common habit. If you‚Äôre surrounded by jazz lovers, you‚Äôre more likely to believe it‚Äôs reasonable to play jazz every day. Your culture sets your expectation for what is ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You‚Äôll rise together.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,590\rTo make your habits even more attractive, you can take this strategy one step further. Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. Steve Kamb, an entrepreneur in New York City, runs a company called Nerd Fitness, which ‚Äúhelps nerds, misfits, and mutants lose weight,\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,593\rget strong, and get healthy.‚Äù His clients include video game lovers, movie fanatics, and average Joes who want to get in shape.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,594\rbut if you are already similar to the other members of the group in some way‚Äîsay, your mutual love of Star Wars‚Äîchange becomes more appealing because it feels like something people like you already do.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,596\rNothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe.

The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,626\rWhenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, ‚ÄúWhat is everyone else doing?‚Äù We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the ‚Äúbest‚Äù buying, eating, and travel habits. It‚Äôs usually a smart strategy. There is evidence in numbers.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,629\rBut there can be a downside. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. For example, one study found that when a chimpanzee learns an effective way to crack nuts open as a member of one group and then switches to a new group that uses a less effective strategy, it will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to blend in with the rest of the chimps.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,633\rThe reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we‚Äôd rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,635\rThe human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants to get along with others.

Running against the grain of your culture requires extra effort.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,637\rWhen changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive.

We want to be the one in the gym who can do muscle-ups or the musician who can play the hardest chord progressions or the parent with the most accomplished children because these things separate us from the crowd. Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,645\rThis is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly effective people. We try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,649\rHigh-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of others. And that means if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,650\rWe are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our status. We trim our hedges and mow our lawn because we don‚Äôt want to be the slob of the neighborhood. When our mother comes to visit, we clean up the house because we don‚Äôt want to be judged. We are continually wondering ‚ÄúWhat will others think of me?‚Äù and altering our behavior based on the answer.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,659\rThe culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. ‚ñ† We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. ‚ñ† We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). ‚ñ† One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,665\rsomething in common with the group. ‚ñ† The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual.

New versions of old vices. The underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same. The specific habits we perform differ based on the period of history.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,721\rYour current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it. Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. As we covered\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,723\rin our discussion of the 1st Law, your brain is continually absorbing information and noticing cues in the environment. Every time you perceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction about what to do in the next moment.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,734\rTwo people can look at the same cigarette, and one feels the urge to smoke while the other is repulsed by the smell. The same cue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on your prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,736\rThese predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically describe a craving‚Äîa feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can apply.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,741\rA craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state. When the temperature falls, there is a gap between what your body is currently sensing and what it wants to be sensing. This gap between your current state and your desired state provides a reason to act.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,744\rDesire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,747\rOur feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current state or to make\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,747\ra change. They help us decide the best course of action.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,749\rAs the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, ‚ÄúIt is emotion that allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,753\rIn time, you learn to predict that checking social media will help you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow you to forget your fears. Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,756\rYou can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. For instance, we often talk about everything we have to do in a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner for your family. Now, imagine changing just one word: You don‚Äôt ‚Äúhave‚Äù to. You ‚Äúget‚Äù to.4 You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,763\rThe key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,764\rI once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair.

After doing it five, ten, twenty times, putting his headphones on became a cue that he automatically associated with increased focus. The craving followed naturally.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,792\rWhile it physically warmed me up to play, more importantly, it put me in the right mental state.

You don‚Äôt need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,877\rNeuroscientists call this long-term potentiation, which refers to the strengthening of connections between neurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,886\rWhen scientists analyzed the brains of taxi drivers in London, they found that the hippocampus‚Äîa region of the brain involved in spatial memory‚Äîwas significantly larger in their subjects than in non‚Äìtaxi drivers.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,896\rEach time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular neural circuit associated with that habit. This means that simply putting in your reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,899\rAll habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity.

If you find yourself continually struggling to follow through on your plans, then you can take a page from Victor Hugo and make\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,201\ryour bad habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a commitment device. A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future.2 It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones. When Victor Hugo shut his clothes away so he could focus on writing, he was creating a commitment device.4 fn2\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,212\rCommitment devices are useful because they enable you to take advantage of good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation. Whenever I‚Äôm looking to cut calories, for example, I will ask the\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,214\rwaiter to split my meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served.

Commitment devices increase the odds that you‚Äôll do the right thing in the future by making bad habits difficult in the present. However, we can do even better. We can make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,236\rThe best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don‚Äôt even have the option to act. The brilliance of the cash register was that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing practically impossible.

The earliest remains of modern humans,\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,408\rknown as Homo sapiens sapiens, are approximately two hundred thousand years old.12 These were the first humans to have a brain relatively similar to ours.

The ending of any experience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other\nPink highlight | Location: 2,468\rThe best approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,469\rHabit stacking, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start.

The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,492\rIn summary, a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last.

Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident,\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,850\rnatural antidepressant.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,852\rAs a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a personality trait all people possess to various degrees. People who are high in neuroticism tend to be anxious and worry more than others. This trait has been\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,853\rlinked to hypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain responsible for noticing threats.14 In other words, people who are more sensitive to negative cues in their environment are more likely to score high in neuroticism.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,872\rLearning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful. In theory, you can enjoy almost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the things that come easily to you. People who are talented in a particular area tend to be more competent at that task and are then praised for doing a good job. They stay energized because they are making progress where others have failed, and because they get rewarded with better pay and bigger opportunities, which not only makes them happier but also propels them to produce even higher-quality work. It‚Äôs a virtuous cycle.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,877\rPick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,878\rIn many cases, when people pick the wrong habit, it simply means they picked a habit that was too difficult.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,882\rThe most common approach is trial and error. Of course, there‚Äôs a problem with this strategy: life is short. You don‚Äôt have time to try every career, date every eligible bachelor, or play every musical instrument. Thankfully, there is an effective way to manage this conundrum, and it is known as the explore/exploit trade-off.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,885\ractivity, there should be a period of exploration. In relationships, it‚Äôs called dating. In college, it‚Äôs called the liberal arts. In business, it‚Äôs called split testing. The goal is to try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,890\rIn the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent. Google famously asks employees to spend 80 percent of the workweek on their official job and 20 percent on projects of their choice, which has led to the creation of\nPink highlight | Location: 2,892\rblockbuster products like AdWords and Gmail.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,897\rAs you explore different options, there are a series of questions you can ask yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you:\nPink highlight | Location: 2,899\rWhat feels like fun to me, but work to others? The mark of whether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most people.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,900\rWhen are you enjoying yourself while other\nPink highlight | Location: 2,900\rpeople are complaining? The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,901\rWhat makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades away.19 This blend of happiness and peak performance is what athletes and performers experience when they are ‚Äúin the zone.‚Äù It is nearly impossible to experience a flow state and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,905\rWhere do I get greater returns than the average person? We are continually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a behavior is more likely to be satisfying when the comparison is in our favor. When I started writing at jamesclear.com, my email list grew very quickly. I wasn‚Äôt quite sure what I was doing well, but I knew that results seemed to be coming faster for me than\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,908\rfor some of my colleagues, which motivated me to keep writing.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,909\rWhat comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, ‚ÄúWhat feels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?‚Äù No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,913\rTo be honest, some of this process is just luck. Michael Phelps and Hicham El Guerrouj were lucky to be born with a rare set of abilities that are highly valued by society and to be placed in the ideal environment for those abilities.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,916\rIf you can‚Äôt find a game where the odds are stacked in your favor, create one. Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, says, ‚ÄúEveryone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort.20 In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I‚Äôm hardly an artist. And I‚Äôm not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I‚Äôm funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It‚Äôs the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,922\rWhen you can‚Äôt win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,925\rtheir weaknesses.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,929\rSpecialization is a powerful way to overcome the ‚Äúaccident‚Äù of bad genetics. The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,931\rstrength. Even if you‚Äôre not the most naturally gifted, you can often win by being the best in a very narrow category.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,932\rBoiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can‚Äôt control whether you‚Äôre a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where it‚Äôs better to be hard or soft. If you can find a more favorable environment, you can transform the situation from one where the odds are against you to one where they are in your favor.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,936\rOur genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on. Once we realize our strengths, we know where to spend our time and energy. We know which types of opportunities to look for and which types of challenges to avoid. The better we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,940\rfulfilling your own potential than comparing yourself to someone else. The fact that you have a natural limit to any specific ability has nothing to do with whether you are reaching the ceiling of your capabilities. People get so caught up in the fact that they have limits that they rarely exert the effort required to get close to them.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,942\rFurthermore, genes can‚Äôt make you successful if you‚Äôre not doing the work. Yes, it‚Äôs possible that the ripped trainer at the gym has better genes, but if you haven‚Äôt put in the same reps, it‚Äôs impossible to say if you have been dealt a better or worse genetic hand. Until you work as hard as those you admire, don‚Äôt explain away their success as luck. In summary, one of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills. Work hard on the things that come easy.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,948\rThe secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. ‚ñ† Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle. ‚ñ† Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. ‚ñ† Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you. ‚ñ† Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can‚Äôt find a game that favors you, create one. ‚ñ† Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,980\rWhile there is still much to learn, one of the most consistent findings is that the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of ‚Äújust manageable difficulty.‚Äù\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,982\rThe human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty. If you love tennis and try to play a serious match against a four-year-old, you will quickly become bored. It‚Äôs too easy. You‚Äôll win every point. In contrast, if you play a professional tennis player like Roger Federer or Serena Williams, you will quickly lose motivation because the match is too difficult.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,988\rThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,993\rWhen you‚Äôre starting a new habit, it‚Äôs important to keep the behavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it even when conditions aren‚Äôt perfect. This is an idea we covered in detail while discussing the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,003\rA flow state is the experience of being ‚Äúin the zone‚Äù and fully immersed in an activity. Scientists have tried to quantify this feeling. They found that to achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current ability.5 In real life it‚Äôs typically not feasible to quantify the difficulty of an action in this way, but the core idea of the Goldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just manageable difficulty‚Äîsomething on the perimeter of your ability‚Äîseems crucial for maintaining motivation.\nBlue highlight | Location: 3,007\rImprovement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularly search for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make enough progress to stay motivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without variety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self-improvement.\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,015\rHe mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he said something I wasn‚Äôt expecting: ‚ÄúAt some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,017\rHis answer surprised me because it‚Äôs a different way of thinking about work ethic. People talk about getting ‚Äúamped up‚Äù to work on their goals. Whether it‚Äôs business or sports or art, you hear people say things like, ‚ÄúIt all comes down to passion.‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúYou have to really want it.‚Äù As a result, many of us get depressed when we lose focus or motivation because we think that successful people have some bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was saying that\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,020\rreally successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,025\rThe greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us.\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,029\rAs Machiavelli noted, ‚ÄúMen desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,033\rIn psychology, this is known as a variable reward.7 fn2 Slot machines are the most common real-world example.

If Google only delivered a useful search result some of the time, I would switch to a competitor pretty quickly.

When you start a business, there will be days when you don‚Äôt feel like showing up. When you‚Äôre at the gym, there will be sets that you don‚Äôt feel like finishing. When it‚Äôs time to write, there will be days that you don‚Äôt feel like typing. But stepping up when it‚Äôs annoying or painful or draining to do so, that‚Äôs what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur.\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,054\rProfessionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,056\rDavid Cain, an author and meditation teacher, encourages his students to avoid being ‚Äúfair-weather meditators.‚Äù Similarly, you don‚Äôt want to be a fair-weather athlete or a fair-weather writer or a fair-weather anything.\nBlue highlight | Location: 3,057\rWhen a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood.\nPink highlight | Location: 3,058\rProfessionals take action even when the mood isn‚Äôt right.\nPink highlight | Location: 3,060\rThere have been a lot of articles I haven‚Äôt felt like writing, but I‚Äôve never regretted publishing on schedule.

Some CMOs condemn ad agencies for wasting time and money trying to be Super Bowl‚Äìcreative instead of market-effective. Others blame the noise from free online ads that drowns out their paid ads.

Emotional Communication\nYellow highlight | Location: 330\rAt the heart of an effective creative philosophy is the belief that nothing is so powerful as an insight into human nature, what compulsions drive a man, what instincts dominate his action, even though his language so often camouflages what really motivates him. ‚ÄîBill Bernbach\nBlue highlight | Location: 337\rAccording to one biography, Bernbach spoke to clients ‚Äú.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äânot of advertising, but the art of persuasion. To persuade the consumer, the creators of ads needed to touch people‚Äôs basic, unchanging instincts‚Äîtheir ‚Äòobsessive drive to survive, to be admired, to succeed, to love, to take care of their own.‚Äô‚Äù4\nBlue highlight | Location: 340\rThe first step to mastering emotional manipulation is to realize that there are only two primary emotions, pleasure and pain.\nBlue highlight | Location: 348\rAs Paul Bloom, professor of psychology and behavioral science at Yale, explains in his book How Pleasure Works, ‚ÄúWhat matters most is not the world as it appears to our senses. Rather, the enjoyment (or suffering) we get from something derives from what we think that thing is.‚Äù7\nBlue highlight | Location: 351\rBloom claims that we are essentialists. Our response is conditioned by our beliefs of what things really are, what their essential nature is.8\nBlue highlight | Location: 357\rBut the Caltech study used an fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) device to observe the volunteers‚Äô brain activity. The imaging revealed that when the participants drank what they believed to be a more expensive wine, the region of the brain linked to pleasure lit up.9 It wasn‚Äôt snobbery. They actually enjoyed greater\nBlue highlight | Location: 360\rpleasure from the wines they believed were more expensive.\nBlue highlight | Location: 365\rThe finding: Participants who believed they were shocked intentionally felt the shocks more painfully, and the pain lingered throughout the study. Those who believed that the shocks were unintentional experienced less pain and a quicker recovery.\nBlue highlight | Location: 367\rFor both pleasure and pain, the meaning of the perception, not the sensory experience alone, determines how much pleasure or pain people experience. Because pleasure and pain are great motivators, creating these experiences within an ad promised to be marketing‚Äôs most powerful tool.\nBlue highlight | Location: 369\rUnfortunately, however, this insight devolved into the techniques of seduction and coercion. Seduction entices someone to do something with the promise of pleasure; coercion persuades\nBlue highlight | Location: 370\rthem to act with the threat of pain.\nBlue highlight | Location: 377\rscreen. That‚Äôs why nearly two-thirds of millennials\nBlue highlight | Location: 380\rWhat‚Äôs left? If emotional manipulation angers people, and if rhetorical persuasion strikes them as BS, how can you connect with your customers? How can you solve your marketing crisis?\nBlue highlight | Location: 383\rWe advocate a solution that‚Äôs tens of thousands of years old, the mode of communication that best fits the mind, that best connects one mind with another, that wraps the clarity of a rational message inside an emotional package and delivers it with sticking power: story.\nBlue highlight | Location: 386\rEmotional because we empathize with its characters; meaningful because the actions of our protagonist deliver insights into human nature.\nBlue highlight | Location: 389\rMany assume that because they‚Äôve seen and heard a lifetime\nBlue highlight | Location: 389\rof stories, they could easily create one.

T in that a well-told story demands skillful execution of its inner technology, its mechanisms of action/reaction, changing value charges, roles, conflicts, turning points, emotional dynamics, and much more. A craft underpins the art. Story structure, as we‚Äôll see in the next chapter, is intrinsic to the human mind. Why then do we need to learn its craft? Isn‚Äôt storytelling natural? By the same token, children can sketch stick figures. Isn‚Äôt drawing also natural? Yes, both are, but to achieve excellence, authors and painters move beyond instinct to experiment and master their craft anew.\nYellow highlight | Location: 405\rIf you study story technique, you can learn to hook, hold, and reward your audience‚Äôs attention, as do the finest of films, plays, and novels.

Memory: The power to store and recall experience.\nPink highlight | Location: 509\rThe past makes the future in this way: Memory builds an understanding of people and the world by recording patterns of experience, stacking them one on top of another by what they have in common, and then telling itself, ‚ÄúThis is how the world works.‚Äù\nPink highlight | Location: 511\rThe mind then uses these patterns from the past in an effort to control the future by taking actions designed to make history repeat itself.\nBlue highlight | Location: 515\r4. Intelligence: The power to extract knowledge from both formal learning and everyday experience, and then apply deductive, inductive, and causal logics to reason to factual, truthful conclusions.\nBlue highlight | Location: 518\rImagination: The power to reshape reality into undreamed-of possibilities.\nBlue highlight | Location: 522\rInsight: The power to see through appearances and perceive inner causalities.\nBlue highlight | Location: 522\rAn insightful mind reads surface signs and then senses the hidden forces that move within and cause things to happen.\nOrange highlight | Location: 523\rData, for example, only measures the outer results of what has changed; insight discovers how and why what has changed has changed.\nBlue highlight | Location: 524\rThe storyteller, as we will see, uses this keen perspective to show us a world we think we understand, but then cracks open reality to first surprise us, then deliver a rush of insight into the hows and whys of that world and its characters. A lifetime of story-driven insights civilizes human beings, builds institutions, and makes culture viable.\nPink highlight | Location: 527\rCorrelation: The power to create. The correlating mind takes two things it already knows, and then seeks a hidden connection, a third thing that joins the two in a way no one else has ever seen before.\nPink highlight | Location: 533\rSelf-Expression: The power to perform.\nPink highlight | Location: 540\rThe mind builds stories to bridge the gap between itself and the universe, between itself and the past, present, and future.\nPink highlight | Location: 541\rStory form imposes order on chaos;\nPink highlight | Location: 541\rseems to express the cause and effect of the is; it unifies events to\nPink highlight | Location: 542\rKnowledge expressed in story form gathers other human beings around its themes, uniting communities and building cultures.\nBlue highlight | Location: 543\rSo, in the marketing context, the takeaway is this: Storified communication is the most powerful form of messaging because story fits the mind; story fits the mind because the mind converts actuality into story in the first place. It‚Äôs a tautology.

The mind embraces a well-told story; the imagination is its natural home. Once through our mental door, story fits, sticks, and excites consumer choice. The next time you‚Äôre bored to the bone by somebody‚Äôs ‚Äústory,‚Äù in all likelihood you‚Äôre not being told a story. If you were, you‚Äôd be listening and engrossed.

In the practical world of business, the brevity of advertising time, along with the high costs of creatives and production, confines marketing stories to one or two turning points. MEANING\nBlue highlight | Location: 682\rFirst, at the core of all stories pulses at least one binary value‚Äîsuch as life/death, freedom/tyranny, success/failure, truth/lie, love/hate, and the like.\nBlue highlight | Location: 686\rSecond, the dynamic of cause and effect within the story‚Äôs events expresses the hows and whys,\nOrange highlight | Location: 700\rWriters of fiction for page, stage, and screen have little difficulty imagining their story‚Äôs buying public.\nBlue highlight | Location: 703\rAt the end of the day, the professional writer judges his quality of work not by its effect on him, but by the degree to which the effect he hoped for affects his readers or audience.\nYellow highlight | Location: 708\rSubject matter for a story contains three major components: a physical and social setting, a protagonist, and a core value. Life offers the storyteller an infinite variety of each.\nOrange highlight | Location: 710\rIn fact, more often than not, the spark of originality that ignites an exceptional story flashes through a creative‚Äôs imagination not while she daydreams, but as she sweats out the grunt work of founding her story-world and planting its setups.\nPink highlight | Location: 712\rWorld-building, therefore, is storytelling‚Äôs critical second step.\nBlue highlight | Location: 713\rThe weakest choices of all favor the general over the specific.\nBlue highlight | Location: 716\rThe mind works best when it moves from the specific to the universal‚Äînot the other way around. Consider, for example, the phrase a piece of furniture.\nNote:Important\nPink highlight | Location: 718\rparticular. But if I say, ‚ÄúA wingback Duchess chair upholstered in blood-red leather,‚Äù a clear image glows in your mind. Instinctively, your imagination moves forward from this particular to the general, slotting the chair into the mental category ‚Äúfurniture.‚Äù This applies to all aspects of a story‚Äôs world, physical and social.\nBlue highlight | Location: 720\rTherefore, the principle: The more specific the setting, the more universal the story‚Äôs appeal.\nBlue highlight | Location: 731\r(1) Physical‚Äîthe horizontal landscape and every object on it. (2) Social‚Äîthe vertical hierarchy of a society‚Äôs pyramid of power and the possibility for movement up or down.\nBlue highlight | Location: 736\rEvery physical setting contains a social setting as well, a cast of characters defined by demographic factors such as age, gender, income, employment, and ethnicity.

This value determines a story‚Äôs fundamental meaning and emotion.\nBlue highlight | Location: 754\rThe core value that pulses at the heart of a story determines its specific meaning and unique emotional impact.\nBlue highlight | Location: 761\rA core character must be empathetic; she or he may or may not be sympathetic.\nBlue highlight | Location: 763\rEmpathetic means ‚Äúlike me‚Äù‚Äîan innate trait shared by both the core character and the target audience.\nBlue highlight | Location: 764\rSympathy is optional, empathy essential, for this reason: Audience involvement hinges on an act of personal identification.\nBlue highlight | Location: 765\rRather, the psychological bond of empathy only develops when an audience subconsciously identifies with a positive human quality emanating from within the character. This quality becomes the story‚Äôs center of good.\nPink highlight | Location: 768\rThe moment a story appears in front of audience members or readers, they instantly and instinctively inspect its value-charged landscape, seeking an emotional door into the story, a place to stick their empathy. They sort the positives from the negatives, the goods from the bads, the rights from the wrongs, the things of value from the things of no value. Everyone searches for a center of good because, in his heart of hearts, everyone instinctively sees himself as good.\nBlue highlight | Location: 773\rTherefore, all people, regardless of their humanity or lack of it, seek a positive glow somewhere in a story‚Äôs world, a mooring for their empathy.\nBlue highlight | Location: 774\rIdeally, the storyteller places this center of good within the protagonist so that a positive human quality emanates from within the core character and captures the audience‚Äôs personal involvement. This empathy magnet also anchors the mirror story, which we will explain in\nBlue highlight | Location: 779\rBefore a story begins, its physical setting, social setting, core value, and core character rest in a state of balance.\nPink highlight | Location: 791\rFirst, it captures\nBlue highlight | Location: 792\rAs we pointed out earlier, the mind keys on change, and the inciting incident‚Äôs sudden pivot of the protagonist‚Äôs life sharply focuses the audience‚Äôs interest.\nBlue highlight | Location: 794\rWhen you think back, how many perfectly lousy stories have you sat through for no other reason than to get the answer to the nagging question: ‚ÄúHow does this piece of dreck turn out?‚Äù\nPink highlight | Location: 795\rThird, when curiosity over the MDQ merges with empathy for the protagonist, a story generates the compelling magnetism known as suspense. Suspense doubles involvement.

What would you risk your time for? What would you risk your life for? What would you risk your soul for? The most compelling objects of desire come with the highest price tags, and the greater the object‚Äôs worth, the greater the involvement. Contrariwise, watching a character pursue something of no real value is the definition of boredom.\nYellow highlight | Location: 815\rstorytelling becomes the art of merging and organizing many streams of want into a flow of events that aims at a single object of desire.\nYellow highlight | Location: 823\rThese desires not only cement the status quo of a character‚Äôs life but also temper his behavior. Background desires form the web of restraints that follow every character into every scene. These fixed desires for stability limit the character‚Äôs actions, restraining what he may or may not say or do to get what he wants.\nYellow highlight | Location: 826\rDesire answers what questions: What does the character consciously want? What does he subconsciously long for? Motivation answers why questions. Why does a character want what he wants? Why does he want his particular object of desire?\nPink highlight | Location: 828\rThe roots of human motivation reach deep into childhood and, for that reason, are often irrational.\nPink highlight | Location: 830\rBiographers of historical figures‚ÄîCharles Darwin, Eleanor Roosevelt, Picasso‚Äîdevote chapter upon chapter detailing the upbringing of each, trying to\nPink highlight | Location: 831\rdocument the precise childhood experiences that motivated these personages to do the great things they did.\nOrange highlight | Location: 832\rShakespeare, on the other hand, never mentions motivation.\nBlue highlight | Location: 834\rSTAGE FIVE: THE FIRST ACTION PRIME PRINCIPLE: TACTICAL CHOICE\nBlue highlight | Location: 835\rDesire demands deeds.\nYellow highlight | Location: 836\rThis positive/negative dynamic propels his story to climax.\nYellow highlight | Location: 838\rEvery human being acts from one moment to the next on his personal sense of probability, on what he feels will probably happen when he does what he intends to do next.\nYellow highlight | Location: 843\rFrom his quiver of personal tactics, he draws strategic behaviors, all in an effort to move toward his desire of the moment and long-term hopes.\nYellow highlight | Location: 844\rAnd because, like everyone else, he is one of a kind, his sense of what will probably happen when he takes an action will also be one of a kind; therefore, his choice of tactic (exact words, gestures, facial expressions, and so on) will, in turn, be one of a kind.\nYellow highlight | Location: 847\rIt‚Äôs this infinitude of idiosyncratic tactics that inspires storytellers to imagine unique characters, the sort found in the best-told stories, with behaviors like no one else‚Äôs, behaviors that fascinate.\nYellow highlight | Location: 849\rEvolution programmed the genes of every living thing to conserve life down to the last calorie of energy, take no uncalled-for risks, and yet pursue all necessary desires.

The clash between what he thinks will happen and the result he actually gets jolts him and splits open his reality.\nBlue highlight | Location: 869\rThe character stares, as it were, into the gap between his subjective anticipation and its objective result. Then with a rush of insight, he suddenly glimpses how his world actually works; how its unforeseen forces of antagonism now block his path.\nBlue highlight | Location: 873\rWhen an unanticipated, even contradictory, obstacle violates a protagonist‚Äôs expectations, it moves him farther from his object of desire than he was before he acted.\nBlue highlight | Location: 887\rInner Obstacles: Contradictory forces within a character‚Äôs body, emotions, and mind with its warring conscious and subconscious desires.\nBlue highlight | Location: 891\rTo turn a scene means to change its value charge; the phrase turning point names the precise moment when an unforeseen force of antagonism violates expectations and pivots the value at stake from positive to negative or negative to positive.\nBlue highlight | Location: 893\rTurning points trigger change in only one of two ways‚Äîeither by a direct action followed by the reaction it sparks, or by a revelation of a secret or previously unknown fact and the response it unleashes.\nYellow highlight | Location: 898\rThe Rational Effects of TURNING POINTS A violation of expectation is, in essence, an effect with an unknown cause. As a result, turning points pop questions into the mind such as ‚ÄúWhy have things taken this unforeseen turn? Why didn‚Äôt the character see this coming? Why didn‚Äôt I?

The moment the audience glimpses this hidden truth, it erupts with an ‚ÄúOh, yeah, now I get it!‚Äù insight that both delights and enlightens.\nYellow highlight | Location: 911\rAs Aristotle observed, the deepest audience pleasure is learning without being taught.

But when things change, awareness snaps to alert as our animal instincts warn us that change threatens survival.\nYellow highlight | Location: 922\rEmotion, therefore, is the side effect of change. When the mind senses change from negative to positive, it releases pleasure-giving chemicals; if the mind registers a movement from positive to negative, it unleashes a painful flow.\nYellow highlight | Location: 926\rAd Age named ‚ÄúReal Beauty‚Äù one of the top five ad campaigns of the century.\nYellow highlight | Location: 928\rIn 2013, Hugo Veiga created a video titled Dove Real Beauty Sketches.2 The story follows a group of women who volunteer for an odd experiment: They agree to have their portrait done by a sketch artist who cannot see them.

This act of courage immediately draws empathy from the audience.\nYellow highlight | Location: 936\rThe above graphic tracks the emotional dynamics in the Dove Real Beauty Sketches video. Its turning points swivel between the opposing poles of its core value, from self-criticism to self-appreciation.\nBlue highlight | Location: 946\rThe story climaxes on the doubly positive charge of self-appreciation. During this decisive transition, the audience shares in the women‚Äôs triumph over self-criticism and feels, with them, a positive emotion.\nBlue highlight | Location: 948\rAll well-told stories express how and why life changes, and, as we noted above,\nOrange highlight | Location: 948\rthe side effect of change is emotion.\nBlue highlight | Location: 949\rThese feelings, however, only come to life during a transition. As a story shifts from positive to negative, the audience feels a dark emotion; as it transitions from negative to positive, a light emotion fills them. Once change completes itself, however, emotion quickly dissipates, ready to move in a new direction. To grip and hold emotional involvement, a story‚Äôs values must transition dynamically from change to change to change.\nBlue highlight | Location: 957\rFaced with an array of possible actions, she must choose one last tactic in a final effort to put life back in balance.\nBlue highlight | Location: 958\rDecisions come in two kinds: clear choices versus dilemmas‚Äîthe easy versus the hard.\nBlue highlight | Location: 960\rClear choices obey nature‚Äôs grand imperative: Always choose the positive.\nBlue highlight | Location: 961\rEvery living thing, flora and fauna, instinctively heeds the two laws governing the conservation of energy and life: (1) Never do anything you don‚Äôt have to do if you can get what you want the easier way. (2) Never take any risk you don‚Äôt have to take if you can get what you want the safer way.\nBlue highlight | Location: 968\rDilemmas also come in two kinds, and both are hard because they pose a choice between either two positives or two negatives, known respectively as irreconcilable goods and the lesser of two evils.\nBlue highlight | Location: 972\rThe hard choice of dilemma causes anxiety before the choice and risk during it.\nBlue highlight | Location: 975\rBut as we‚Äôll see in the next chapter, in the marketer‚Äôs purpose-told story, the protagonist‚Äôs climactic choice must be pressure-and stress-free.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,013\rUnlike full-length fictions, purpose-told stories abbreviate events. The typical business story is a mini-tale told in a thirty-second commercial or a three-minute YouTube video. GE‚Äôs ‚ÄúOwen‚Äù ads and the Dove Real Beauty Sketches are two perfect examples of each.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,016\rThe marketing story, no. Purpose-told works crack open the gap between expectation and result usually only once, perhaps twice, maybe three times at the most.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,028\rThe purpose-told‚Äôs audience members take their storified experience into the real world and relive it each and every time they purchase the subject product or service. In other words, the purpose of the purpose-told story is to transform the aesthetic pleasure of a story‚Äôs climax into a viable action in the marketplace‚Äîto turn audiences into consumers.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,032\rwe gain an insight into life we never knew before, all enveloped in emotions we never felt quite that way before. This fusion of idea and emotion adds a measure of enrichment, great or small, to our inner life. We exit a beautifully told story a fuller human being than when we entered.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,035\rThe fiction-told story fulfills itself in one telling, whereas the purpose-told story retells its tale in the mind of the consumer each and every time she buys its product or hires its service.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,038\rConcentrated experiences entertain because they carry us through time unaware of the passage of time.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,047\rThe audience of the purpose-told story, on the other hand, ignores the artist and feels brand loyalty instead. Brand loyalty, and the lifetime of purchases that comes with it, is created by the mirror experience at the heart of the purpose-told story. THE MIRROR EXPERIENCE Well-told stories create two simultaneous experiences that mirror each other: one mental, the other emotional. The mental mirror experience begins and ends with curiosity. A story‚Äôs inciting incident teases the audience‚Äôs mind with unanswered questions such as ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going to happen next? What‚Äôll happen after that? How will this story turn out? Will the protagonist win his object of desire?‚Äù The rational mirror experience in story mirrors the same set\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,059\rFirst, the identification. The moment the target consumer recognizes a shared humanity between herself and the protagonist, her instincts follow the logic of kinship: ‚ÄúThat character is a human being like me. Therefore, I want that character to get what he wants, because if I were that character in that situation, I would want the same thing for myself.‚Äù In other words, she bonds.2\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,065\rShe instinctively experiences the events as if they were happening to her.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,067\rThird, the reenactment. The consumer‚Äôs mirror experience motivates her to act. Wishing to relive the positive charge of the purpose-told story, she purchases the product or hires the service embedded in the telling. Her post-story reenactment satisfies her need and the marketer‚Äôs purpose simultaneously. In short, she becomes a customer.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,074\rThe mind memorizes the patterns of cause and effect that underlie real-life past events so it can strategize its future actions. As events impact us over the years, we gather knowledge of how things work, how the various forces in our world interconnect.

As we demonstrated in the emotion-creation section of the previous chapter, this insight into the target audience‚Äôs inciting incident and resulting object of desire inspired Ogilvy \u0026amp; Mather to weave a purpose-told story around the core value of self-criticism versus self-appreciation.

If so, the tale must be told from that point of view. To do so, however, the storyteller faces this challenging problem: How can I fuse an empathetic connection between consumer and protagonist when the latter is either an inanimate object or an impersonal institution?\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,168\rFantasy worlds and characters demand imagination, innovation, and creative execution. Rather than face that task, many campaigns abandon storytelling in favor of a spokesperson bragging and making promises the product‚Äôs performance may or may not be able to keep.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,172\rTo turn a corporation into an empathetic protagonist, the marketer first must identify the company‚Äôs primal value, a value so essential to its nature that if it were lost, the company would disappear with it.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,177\rAlways bear in mind that the center of good expresses itself in action, not association.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,182\rEach person draws her personal identity from the culture that surrounds her.

If you cast a product as a protagonist, do not brag about its newness, its hipness, its celebrity. The world spares no empathy for an overdog; market with a graceful humility.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,234\rBut no matter how you characterize your protagonist, his reaction to the inciting incident should draw the audience‚Äôs empathy and emotional concern, placing him at the story‚Äôs center of good.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,236\rBy doubling involvement via both curiosity and empathy, you transform the customer‚Äôs passing interest into suspense, laying the groundwork for the surprise that springs loose in Stage Five.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,272\rTo invent a one-of-a-kind telling, merge your knowledge with your imagination, and then\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,272\rask: What exactly does my brand, corporation, product, or consumer want?\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,274\rHow does this object of desire relate to the core value (for example, just/unjust or rich/poor) of the story?

In short, the essence of reality is humanity‚Äôs ongoing strivings against negation.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,310\rMarketing stories move from problem to solution, not solution to solution to solution.

Answer: because their tellings deliberately avoid any hint of conflict. And why is that? Answer: negaphobia.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,319\rNegaphobia is a by-product of marketing education. Ever since the invention of the business school, and marketing as a unique discipline within its curriculum, marketers have been trained, as the old song goes, to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,323\rToday, for example, the worst thing one employee might say about another is: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so negative.‚Äù\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,323\rall probability, the guy in question is simply a realist who sees things as they are, downsides and all, but from cubicle to cubicle, those who cannot face the sharp edges of reality tend to shun those who can.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,327\rFirst: as mentioned, the business school dictum to protect your brand from any and all criticism.

She doesn‚Äôt know how it will be done, but it‚Äôs out there, so she can‚Äôt look away. This curiosity holds your prospect‚Äôs attention, even in a world of constant distraction. Marketing stories are generally brief. The protagonist pursues her object of desire through usually only one turning point.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,348\rStage Seven brings the story to its crisis, the highest level of tension and suspense. The protagonist, based on her new knowledge, chooses a new tactic, one she hopes will create a reaction from her world that will deliver her object of desire.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,350\rAt this point in most fiction-told stories, the protagonist stands in dilemma, forced to choose between either two irreconcilable positive possibilities or two equally repugnant negative choices.

THE CMO AS CHANGE AGENT\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,428\rYour first task as change agent is to educate your executive team on the worldwide shift from ad-centric to story-centric marketing. No small task. Conventional C-suite wisdom holds that six-year-olds crave stories, while hard-charging executives don‚Äôt.

Therefore, a transformational\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,468\rChange your team‚Äôs marketing theory to embrace emotional intelligence.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,470\rThe key to decision making is emotion, and emotion is not information. The emotionally targeted question you should ask is: ‚ÄúHow do I want my customers to feel?‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,472\rYour team members must frame their stories to create a feeling of fusion between protagonist and audience. When empathy seals the deal, use progressive conflict and value charge changes to hook and hold your audience, and finally reward it with a story climax that reinforces brand or product values.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,474\rChange the team‚Äôs mental model from static description to dynamic storytelling.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,481\rAs corporate showrunner, the modern CMO educates her team in story craft, produces a storytelling strategy for the brand, and operationalizes its storytelling processes.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,482\rShe recruits the right creatives, guides moment-by-moment storytelling to ensure brand/voice alignment, and exercises good taste to guarantee a quality experience for the brand‚Äôs prospective customers. It‚Äôs a big job.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,487\rEvery CMO starts his day staring at this hard truth: Nobody wants to hear about your company or your product.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,491\rTypically, consumers only debate brands in the mental minute just before they make a purchase. That precious minute makes storified branding an imperative for modern marketing.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,500\rBrand is a single organizing idea, a higher-order construct that everything else comes from and aligns with.

You need a least one story to define your brand, but some brands tell thousands.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,585\rOnce again, empathy. Genius-in-a-garage stories are as old as Thomas Edison.

In fact, we spent the next twenty-five years discovering what Kevin and people like him do.

People openly and honestly express their opinions, share their feelings, and articulate their theories. They willingly and capably share their views, even when their ideas are controversial or unpopular. It‚Äôs the one thing that, and precisely what, Kevin and the other extremely effective communicators we studied were routinely able to achieve.

Now, obviously, they don‚Äôt agree with every idea; they simply do their best to ensure that all ideas find their way into the open.\nBlue highlight | Page: 24\rAs the Pool of Shared Meaning grows, it helps people in two ways. First, as individuals are exposed to more accurate and relevant information, they make better choices.\nBlue highlight | Page: 24\rIn a very real sense, the Pool of Shared Meaning is a measure of\nBlue highlight | Page: 24\ra group‚Äôs IQ. The larger the shared pool, the smarter the decisions. And even though many people may be involved in a choice, when people openly and freely share ideas, the increased time investment is more than offset by the quality of the decision.\nBlue highlight | Page: 24\rOn the other hand, we‚Äôve all seen what happens when the shared pool is dangerously shallow. When people purposefully withhold meaning from one another, individually smart people can do collectively stupid things.\nBlue highlight | Page: 25\rOf course, hospitals don‚Äôt have a monopoly on fear. In every instance where bosses are smart, highly paid, confident, and outspoken (i.e., most of the world), people tend to hold back their opinions rather than risk angering someone in a position of power.

We discredit others, hoping people won‚Äôt believe their arguments. And then we use every manner of force to get our way or possibly even harm others. We borrow power from the boss; we hit people with biased monologues; we make hurtful comments‚Ä¶\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nBlue highlight | Page: 27\rhere‚Äôs how the various elements fit together. When stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions run‚Ä¶\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nBlue highlight | Page: 27\rIn order to move to our best, we have to find a way to explain what is in each of our personal pools of meaning‚Äîespecially our high-stakes, sensitive, and controversial opinions, feelings, and ideas‚Äîand to get others to share their pools.

It can take your breath away.\nBlue highlight | Page: 28\rFinally, we combined our philosophies, theories, models, and skills into a package of learnable tools‚Äîtools for talking when stakes are high. We then taught these skills and watched as key performance indicators and relationships improved.\nBlue highlight | Page: 29\rOn a beautiful sunset balcony in Houston, my dad and I spent three tense hours dealing with a lot of pain and built-up resentment. I kept in mind what I had been taught and, rather than compromising candor, tried my best to create the conditions where we could be both honest and respectful. It was incredibly difficult. Sometimes the honesty threatened to put us right back in the angry state that got us there. But I kept focusing on what I really wanted‚Äîa relationship with my family.\nBlue highlight | Page: 30\rThis is what most people have in mind when they think of crucial conversations. How do I express delicate feedback? How do I speak persuasively, not abrasively? And how about listening? Or better still, what can we do to get people to talk when they seem nervous? And how do we move from thought to action? As you read on, you will learn the key skills of talking, listening, and acting\nYellow highlight | Page: 35\rOur problem is not that our behavior degenerates. It‚Äôs that our motives do‚Äîa fact that we usually miss.\nYellow highlight | Page: 36\rSkilled people Start with Heart. That is, they begin high-risk discussions with the right motives, and they stay focused no matter what happens.\nYellow highlight | Page: 38\rWinning. This particular dialogue killer sits at the top of many of our lists.\nYellow highlight | Page: 39\rPunishing. Sometimes, as our anger increases, we move from wanting to win the point to wanting to harm the other person.\nYellow highlight | Page: 39\rWe move so far away from adding meaning to the pool that now all we want is to see others suffer.\nYellow highlight | Page: 39\rKeeping the peace. Of course, we don‚Äôt always fix mistakes, aggressively discredit others, or heartlessly try to make them suffer.\nOrange highlight | Page: 41\rWe were wondering what had happened to Greta? How, we puzzled, did she remain so composed while under fire? Specifically, how did she move so quickly from wanting to get even with or possibly even humiliate the questioner to sincerely soliciting feedback?\nOrange highlight | Page: 41\rWhat had helped her move from embarrassment and anger to gratitude?\nOrange highlight | Page: 41\r‚ÄúAt first I did feel attacked, and I wanted to strike back. To be honest, I wanted to put that guy in his place. He was accusing me in public, and he was wrong.‚Äù\nOrange highlight | Page: 41\r‚ÄúAnd then it struck me,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúDespite the fact that I had 400 eyeballs pinned to me, a rather important question hit me like a ton of bricks: ‚ÄòWhat do I really want here?‚Äô‚Äù\nOrange highlight | Page: 41\rAsking this question had a powerful effect on Greta‚Äôs thinking. As she focused on this far more important question, she quickly realized that her goal was to encourage these 200 managers to embrace the cost-reduction efforts‚Äîand to thereby influence thousands of others to do the same.\nOrange highlight | Page: 41\rAs Greta contemplated this goal, she realized that the biggest barrier she faced was the widespread belief that she was a hypocrite.\nOrange highlight | Page: 42\rInterestingly, by transforming her motives Greta simultaneously transformed the way she saw the man who asked the question. Whereas seconds earlier he looked like an enemy, when her motives changed, the fellow now looked like an ally. In fact, this man had just handed her the best chance she could get to influence the audience by letting her publicly address a primary source of resistance to the cost-cutting effort. And so Greta moved to dialogue.\nOrange highlight | Page: 42\rintervention‚Äîthe simple act of asking a potent question‚Äîcan have a powerful effect on redirecting our hearts.\nBlue highlight | Page: 42\rRefocus your brain. Now, let‚Äôs move to a situation you might face. You‚Äôre speaking with someone who completely disagrees with you on a hot issue. How does all of this goal stuff apply? As you begin the discussion, start by examining your motives. Going in, ask yourself what you really want. Also, as the conversation unfolds and you find yourself starting to, say, defer to the boss or give your spouse the cold shoulder, pay attention to what‚Äôs happening to your objectives. Are you starting to change your goal to save face, avoid embarrassment, win, be right, or punish others? Here‚Äôs the‚Ä¶\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nOrange highlight | Page: 42\rchemical‚Ä¶\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nOrange highlight | Page: 42\rIn order to move back to motives that allow for dialogue, you must step away from the interaction and look at yourself‚Äîmuch like an outsider. Ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat am I doing, and if I had to guess, what does it tell me about my underlying motive?‚Äù As you make an honest effort to discover your motive, you might conclude: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see. I‚Äôm pushing hard, making the argument stronger than I actually believe, and‚Ä¶\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nOrange highlight | Page: 43\rOnce you call into question the shifting desires of your heart, you can make conscious choices to change them. ‚ÄúWhat I really want is to genuinely try to select a vacation spot we can all enjoy‚Äîrather than try to win people over to my ideas.‚Äù‚Ä¶\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nBlue highlight | Page: 43\rBut how? How do you recognize what has happened to you, stop playing games, and then influence your own motives? Do what Greta did. Stop and ask yourself some questions that return you to dialogue. You can ask these questions either when you find yourself slipping out of dialogue or as reminders when‚Ä¶\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nBlue highlight | Page: 43\rWhat do I really want for myself? What do I really want for others? What do I really‚Ä¶\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nBlue highlight | Page: 43\rOnce you‚Äôve asked yourself what you want, add one more equally telling question: How would I behave if I‚Ä¶\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nBlue highlight | Page: 43\rFind your bearings. There are two good reasons for asking these questions. First, the answer to what we really want helps us to locate our own North Star. Despite the fact that we‚Äôre being tempted to take the wrong path by (1) people who are trying to pick a fight, (2) thousands of years of genetic hard wiring that brings our emotions to a quick boil, and (3) our‚Ä¶\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nBlue highlight | Page: 43\r‚ÄúWhat do I really want? Oh yeah, I guess it‚Äôs not to make the other person squirm or to preen in front of a crowd. I want people to freely and openly‚Ä¶\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nBlue highlight | Page: 44\rTake charge of your body. The second reason for asking what we really want is no less important. When we ask ourselves what we really want, we affect our entire physiology. As we introduce complex and abstract questions to our mind, the problem-solving part of our brain recognizes that‚Ä¶\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\rNote:Important aspect\nBlue highlight | Page: 44\rWhen we present our brain with a demanding question, our body sends precious blood to the parts of our brain that help us think and away from the parts of our body‚Ä¶\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nBlue highlight | Page: 44\rAsking questions about what we really want serves two important purposes. First, it reminds us of our goal. Second, it juices up our‚Ä¶\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nBlue highlight | Page: 44\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nBlue highlight | Page: 45\r‚ÄúAm I the only one who wonders why we even allow this fossil to talk?\nBlue highlight | Page: 45\rcolleagues‚Äîunder the influence of adrenaline we start to see our options as unnecessarily limited. We assume we have to choose between getting results and keeping a relationship. In our dumbed-down condition, we don‚Äôt even consider the option of achieving both.\nBlue highlight | Page: 45\rThat‚Äôs why those who are skilled at crucial conversations present their brain with a more complex question. They routinely ask: ‚ÄúWhat do I want for myself, the other person, and the relationship?‚Äù\nBlue highlight | Page: 45\rWhen our brain isn‚Äôt functioning well, we resist complexity. We adore the ease of simply choosing between attacking\nBlue highlight | Page: 45\ror hiding‚Äîand the fact that we think it makes us look good. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I just had to destroy the guy‚Äôs self-image if I was going to keep my integrity. It wasn‚Äôt pretty, but it was the right thing to do.‚Äù\nBlue highlight | Page: 45\rthat. You‚Äôll find there is a way to share your concerns, listen sincerely to those of others, and build the relationship‚Äîall at the same time. And the results can be life changing.\nBlue highlight | Page: 46\rFirst, clarify what you really want. You‚Äôve got a head start if you‚Äôve already Started with Heart. If you know what you want for yourself, for others, and for the relationship, then you‚Äôre in position to break out of the Fool‚Äôs Choice. ‚ÄúWhat I want is for my husband to be more reliable. I‚Äôm tired of being let down by him when he makes commitments that I depend on.‚Äù Second, clarify what you really don‚Äôt want. This is the key to framing the and question. Think of what you are afraid will happen to you if you back away from your current strategy of trying to win or stay safe. What bad thing will happen if you stop pushing so hard? Or if you don‚Äôt try to escape? What horrible outcome makes game playing an attractive and sensible option? ‚ÄúWhat I don‚Äôt want is to have a useless and heated conversation that creates bad feelings and doesn‚Äôt lead to change.‚Äù Third, present your brain with a more complex problem.\nBlue highlight | Page: 47\rThere is a third set of options out there that allows you to add meaning to the pool and build on the relationship.\nBlue highlight | Page: 48\rAt first, we thought that maybe there were places where dialogue couldn‚Äôt survive. But then we learned to ask: ‚ÄúAre you saying there isn‚Äôt anyone you know who is able to hold a high-risk conversation in a way that solves problems and builds relationships?‚Äù There usually is.\nBlue highlight | Page: 48\rWork on Me First, Us Second ‚Ä¢ Remember that the only person you can directly control is yourself.\nBlue highlight | Page: 48\rFocus on What You Really Want\nBlue highlight | Page: 48\rWhen you find yourself moving toward silence or violence, stop and pay attention to your motives.\nBlue highlight | Page: 48\rAsk yourself: ‚ÄúWhat does my behavior tell me about what my motives are?‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Then, clarify what you really want. Ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat do I want for myself?\nBlue highlight | Page: 48\rFor others? For the relationship?‚Äù ‚Ä¢ And finally, ask: ‚ÄúHow would I behave if this were what I really wanted?‚Äù\nBlue highlight | Page: 48\rAs you consider what you want, notice when you start talking yourself into a Fool‚Äôs Choice. ‚Ä¢ Watch to see if you‚Äôre telling yourself that you must choose between peace and honesty, between winning and losing, and so on. ‚Ä¢ Break free of these Fool‚Äôs Choices by searching for the and. ‚Ä¢ Clarify what you don‚Äôt want, add it to what you do want, and ask your brain to start searching for healthy options to bring you to dialogue.\nBlue highlight | Page: 52\r‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù your coworker explains, ‚ÄúI always watch two elements. When things start turning ugly, I watch the content of the conversation (the topic under discussion) along with the conditions (what people are doing in response). I look for and examine both what and why. If you can see why people are becoming upset or holding back their views or even going silent, you can do something to get back on track.‚Äù\nBlue highlight | Page: 53\rIn truth, most of us do have trouble dual-processing (simultaneously watching for content and conditions)‚Äîespecially when both stakes and emotions are high.\nYellow highlight | Page: 54\rActually, it helps to watch for three different conditions: the moment a conversation turns crucial, signs that people don‚Äôt feel safe (silence or violence), and your own Style Under Stress. Let‚Äôs consider each of these conversation killers in turn.\nYellow highlight | Page: 54\rTo help catch problems early, reprogram your mind to\nYellow highlight | Page: 54\rpay attention to the signs that suggest you‚Äôre in a crucial conversation. Some people first notice physical signals‚Äîtheir stomach gets tight or their eyes get dry. Think about what happens to your body when conversations get tough. Everyone is a little bit different. What are your cues? Whatever they are, learn to look at them as signs to step back, slow down, and Start with Heart before things get out of hand.\nYellow highlight | Page: 55\rPeople who are\nYellow highlight | Page: 55\rgifted at dialogue keep a constant vigil on safety. They pay\nYellow highlight | Page: 55\rWhen it‚Äôs safe, you can say anything. Here‚Äôs why gifted communicators keep a close eye on safety. Dialogue calls for the free flow of meaning‚Äîperiod. And nothing kills the flow of meaning like fear.\nYellow highlight | Page: 55\rThis is a pretty remarkable claim. Think about it. We‚Äôre suggesting that people rarely become defensive simply because of what you‚Äôre saying. They only become defensive when they no longer feel safe. The problem is not the content of your message, but the condition of the conversation.\nYellow highlight | Page: 56\rOn the other hand, if you don‚Äôt feel safe, you can‚Äôt take any feedback.\nYellow highlight | Page: 56\rIt‚Äôs as if the pool of meaning has a lid on it. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean I look good? Is that some kind of joke? Are you insulting me?‚Äù When you don‚Äôt feel safe, even well-intended comments are suspect.\nYellow highlight | Page: 56\rWhen it‚Äôs unsafe, you start to go blind.\nYellow highlight | Page: 57\rAs we‚Äôve said before, when your emotions start cranking up, key brain functions start shutting down. Not only do you prepare to take flight, but your peripheral vision actually narrows. In fact, when you feel genuinely threatened, you can scarcely see beyond what‚Äôs right in front of you.\nYellow highlight | Page: 57\rBy pulling yourself out of the content of an argument and looking for signs that safety is a risk, you reengage your brain and your full vision returns.\nYellow highlight | Page: 57\rAs we suggested earlier, when you give your brain a new problem to consider (keep alert for signs that safety is at risk!), it affects your brain functioning. Your higher reasoning centers stay more active, and you‚Äôre far less likely to be dumbed down and far more likely to succeed in your crucial conversation.\nYellow highlight | Page: 57\rDon‚Äôt let safety problems lead you astray.\nYellow highlight | Page: 57\rImagine the magnitude of what we‚Äôre suggesting here. We‚Äôre asking you to recode silence and violence as signs that people are feeling unsafe.\nYellow highlight | Page: 57\rWe‚Äôre asking you to fight your natural tendency to respond in kind.\nYellow highlight | Page: 57\rWe‚Äôre asking you to undo years of practice, maybe even eons of genetic shaping that prod you to take flight or pick a fight (when under attack), and recode the stimulus. ‚ÄúAh, that‚Äôs a sign that the other person feels unsafe.‚Äù And then what? Do something to make it safe.\nYellow highlight | Page: 58\rImagine increased influence, enhanced relationships, stronger teams, and more effective leadership. Turn on your capacity to recognize and respond to safety problems.\nYellow highlight | Page: 58\rIn the next chapter we‚Äôll explore how. For now, simply learn to look for safety, and then be curious, not angry or frightened.\nYellow highlight | Page: 58\rAs people begin to feel unsafe, they start down one of two unhealthy paths. They move either to silence (withholding meaning from the pool) or to violence (trying to force\nYellow highlight | Page: 58\rThe three most common forms of silence are masking, avoiding, and withdrawing.\nYellow highlight | Page: 60\rThe three most common forms are controlling, labeling, and attacking.\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rActually, no. Perhaps the most difficult element to watch closely as you‚Äôre madly dual-processing is your own behavior. Frankly,\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rUnfortunately, when you fail to monitor your own behavior, you can look pretty silly.\nYellow highlight | Page: 75\rThe good realize that safety is at risk, but they fix it in exactly the wrong way.\nYellow highlight | Page: 75\rThey try to make the subject more palatable by sugarcoating their message.\nYellow highlight | Page: 75\rThe best don‚Äôt play games. Period.\nYellow highlight | Page: 76\rSo they do something completely different. They step out of the content of the conversation, make it safe, and then step back in. Once safety is restored, they can talk about nearly anything.\nYellow highlight | Page: 76\rFor example, Yvonne gets back on the path of dialogue by saying: ‚ÄúCan we change gears for a minute? I‚Äôd like to talk about what happens when we‚Äôre not romantically in sync. It would be good if we could both share what‚Äôs working and what isn‚Äôt. My goal isn‚Äôt to make you feel guilty, and I certainly don‚Äôt want to become defensive. What I‚Äôd really love is for us to come up with a solution that makes us both satisfied in our relationship.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 76\rbut because they believe the content (even if it‚Äôs delivered in a gentle way) suggests that you have a malicious intent.\nYellow highlight | Page: 77\rHow can others feel safe when they believe you‚Äôre out to harm them? Soon, every word out of your mouth is suspect. You can‚Äôt utter a harmless ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù without others interpreting it in a negative way.\nYellow highlight | Page: 77\rMutual Purpose is the entry condition of dialogue. Find a shared goal, and you have both a good reason and a healthy climate for talking.\nYellow highlight | Page: 77\rWatch for signs that Mutual Purpose is at risk. How do we\nYellow highlight | Page: 77\rDo others believe I care about their goals in this conversation? ‚Ä¢ Do they trust my motives?\nYellow highlight | Page: 77\rRemember the Mutual in Mutual Purpose. Just a word to the wise.\nYellow highlight | Page: 78\rWhat do I want for me? ‚Ä¢ What do I want for others? ‚Ä¢ What do I want for the relationship?\nYellow highlight | Page: 78\rLook for the mutuality.\nYellow highlight | Page: 78\rLet‚Äôs say you‚Äôve got a boss who frequently fails to keep commitments. How could you tell the boss you don‚Äôt trust him? Surely there‚Äôs no way to say this without the boss becoming defensive or vengeful, because he knows that your goal is merely to make your life better. To avoid disaster, find a Mutual Purpose that would be so motivating to the boss that he‚Äôd want to hear your concerns. If your only reason for approaching the boss is to get\nYellow highlight | Page: 78\rwhat you want, the boss will hear you as critical and selfish‚Äî\nYellow highlight | Page: 78\rwhich is what you are.\nYellow highlight | Page: 78\rImagine raising the topic this way: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got some ideas for how I can be much more reliable and even reduce costs by a few thousand dollars in preparing the report each month. It‚Äôs going to be a bit of a sensitive conversation‚Äîbut I think it will help a great deal if we can talk about it.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 79\rWhile it‚Äôs true that there‚Äôs no reason to enter a crucial conversation if you don‚Äôt have Mutual Purpose, it‚Äôs equally true that you can‚Äôt stay in the conversation if you don‚Äôt maintain Mutual Respect. Mutual Respect is the continuance condition of dialogue. As people perceive that others don‚Äôt respect them, the conversation immediately becomes unsafe and dialogue comes to a screeching halt.\nYellow highlight | Page: 79\rWhy? Because respect is like air. As long as it‚Äôs present, nobody thinks about it. But if you take it away, it‚Äôs all that people can think about. The instant people perceive disrespect in a conversation, the interaction is no longer about the original purpose‚Äîit is now about defending dignity.\nYellow highlight | Page: 79\rTelltale signs. To spot when respect is violated and safety takes a turn south, watch for signs that people are defending their dignity.\nBlue highlight | Page: 79\rEmotions\nBlue highlight | Page: 79\rWhen people feel disrespected, they become highly charged. Their emotions turn from fear to anger. Then they resort to pouting, name-calling, yelling, and making threats. Ask the following question to determine when Mutual Respect is at risk:\nYellow highlight | Page: 80\rDo others believe I respect them?\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\rHow, they wonder, can they share the same purpose with people who come from completely different backgrounds or whose morals or values differ from theirs? What do you do, for example, if you‚Äôre upset because another person has let you down? And if this has repeatedly happened, how can you respect a person who is so poorly motivated and selfish?\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\rDialogue truly would be doomed if we had to share every objective or respect every element of another person‚Äôs character before we could talk.\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\rHowever, we can stay in dialogue by finding a way to honor and regard another person‚Äôs basic humanity.\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\rIn essence, feelings of disrespect often come when we dwell on how others are different from ourselves.\nNote:Difference - disrespect\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\rWe can counteract these feelings by looking for ways we are similar. Without excusing others‚Äô behavior, we try to sympathize, even empathize, with them.\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\rprayer‚Äî‚ÄúLord, help me forgive those who sin differently than I.‚Äù\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\rWhen we do this, we feel a kinship or mutuality between ourselves and even the thorniest of people.\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\rThis sense of kinship and connection to others helps create Mutual Respect and eventually enables us to stay in dialogue with virtually anyone.\nBlue highlight | Page: 81\rEach group was to go into a separate room and write out its goals for the company on flip-chart-sized paper.\nBlue highlight | Page: 81\rAfter a few minutes the two groups returned to the training room. They were positively stunned. It was as if they had written the exact same lists. They didn‚Äôt merely share the shadow of an idea or two. Their aspirations were nearly identical. All wanted a profitable company, stable and rewarding jobs, high-quality products, and a positive impact on the community. Given a chance to speak freely and without fear of attack, each group laid out not simply what it wanted, but what virtually every person wanted.\nBlue highlight | Page: 82\rApologize ‚Ä¢ Contrast ‚Ä¢ Create a Mutual Purpose\nBlue highlight | Page: 83\rBut you fail to restore safety. Why? Because now you feel disrespected. They‚Äôve attacked you. So you stay stuck in the content of the conversation‚Äîthinking this has something to do with the factory tour.\nBlue highlight | Page: 83\rSee their aggressive behavior for what it is‚Äîa sign of violated safety‚Äî\nBlue highlight | Page: 84\rWhen you‚Äôve made a mistake that has hurt others (e.g., you didn‚Äôt call the team), start with an apology. An apology is a statement that sincerely expresses your sorrow for your role in causing‚Äîor at least not preventing‚Äîpain or difficulty to others.\nBlue highlight | Page: 84\rNow, an apology isn‚Äôt really an apology unless you experience a change in heart. To offer a sincere apology, your motives have to change. You have to give up saving face, being right, or winning in order to focus on what you really want. You have to sacrifice a bit of your ego by admitting your error. But like many sacrifices, when you give up something you value, you‚Äôre rewarded with something even more valuable‚Äîhealthy dialogue and better results.\nBlue highlight | Page: 84\rSometimes others feel disrespected during crucial conversations even though you haven‚Äôt done anything disrespectful.\nBlue highlight | Page: 84\rBut just as often, the insult is entirely unintended.\nBlue highlight | Page: 85\rWhen others misinterpret either your purpose or your intent, step out of the argument and rebuild safety by using a skill called Contrasting.\nBlue highlight | Page: 85\rContrasting is a don‚Äôt/do statement that:\nBlue highlight | Page: 85\rAddresses others‚Äô concerns that you don‚Äôt respect them or that you have a malicious purpose (the don‚Äôt part). ‚Ä¢ Confirms your respect or clarifies your real purpose (the do part).\nBlue highlight | Page: 85\r[The don‚Äôt part] ‚ÄúThe last thing I wanted to do was communicate that I don‚Äôt value the work you put in or that I didn‚Äôt want to share it with the VP. [The do part] I think your work has been nothing short of spectacular.‚Äù\nBlue highlight | Page: 86\rOf the two parts of Contrasting, the don‚Äôt is the more important because it deals with the misunderstanding that has put safety at risk.\nBlue highlight | Page: 87\rContrasting provides context and proportion.\nBlue highlight | Page: 87\ryou talk with your assistant about his lack\nBlue highlight | Page: 88\rAt this point, you could be tempted to water down your content‚Äî‚ÄúYou know it‚Äôs really not that big a deal.‚Äù Don‚Äôt give into the temptation. Don‚Äôt take back what you‚Äôve said. Instead, put your remarks in context.\nBlue highlight | Page: 88\r‚ÄúLet me put this in perspective. I don‚Äôt want you to think I‚Äôm not satisfied with the quality of your work. I want us to continue working together. I really do think you‚Äôre doing a good job. This punctuality issue is important to me, and I‚Äôd just like you to work on that. If you will be more attentive to that, there are no other issues.‚Äù\nBlue highlight | Page: 88\rUse Contrasting for prevention or first aid. Contrasting can be useful both as prevention and as first aid for safety problems.\nBlue highlight | Page: 88\rSo far our examples have helped us apply first\nYellow highlight | Page: 88\raid to a wounded conversation. Someone has taken something wrong, and we‚Äôve intervened to clarify our true purpose or meaning. When we‚Äôre aware that something we‚Äôre about to drop into the pool of meaning\nBlue highlight | Page: 88\rWhen people misunderstand and you start arguing over the misunderstanding, stop. Use Contrasting. Explain what you don‚Äôt mean until you‚Äôve restored safety. Then return to the conversation. Safety first.\nBlue highlight | Page: 91\rThe worst at dialogue either ignore the problem and push ahead or roll over and let others have their way. They opt for either competition or submission. Both strategies end up making winners and losers, and the problem continues long beyond the initial conversation.\nBlue highlight | Page: 91\rThe good at dialogue move immediately toward compromise. For example, the couple facing the transfer sets up two house-holds‚Äîone where the transferred spouse will be working and one where the family currently lives. Nobody really wants this arrangement, and frankly, it‚Äôs a pretty ugly solution that‚Äôs bound to lead to more serious problems, even divorce.

You make you scared, annoyed, or insulted. You and only you create your emotions.\nYellow highlight | Page: 104\rClaim two. Once you‚Äôve created your upset emotions, you have only two options: You can act on them or be acted on by them. That is, when it comes to strong emotions, you either find a way to master them or fall hostage to them. Here‚Äôs how this all unfolds.\nYellow highlight | Page: 106\rThe best at dialogue do something completely different. They aren‚Äôt held hostage by their emotions, nor do they try to hide or suppress them. Instead, they act on their emotions. That is, when they have strong\nYellow highlight | Page: 107\rfeelings, they influence (and often change) their emotions by thinking them out. As a result, they choose their emotions, and by so doing, make it possible to choose behaviors that create better results.\nYellow highlight | Page: 107\rholding her feelings inside (avoiding) and taking cheap shots (masking).\nYellow highlight | Page: 108\rAs it turns out, there is an intermediate step between what others do and how we feel.\nYellow highlight | Page: 108\rThere‚Äôs always an intermediate step because actions themselves can‚Äôt and don‚Äôt cause emotional reactions. That‚Äôs why, when faced with the exact same circumstances, ten people may have ten different emotional responses. For instance, with a coworker like Louis, some might feel insulted whereas others merely feel curious. Some become angry and others feel concern or even sympathy.\nYellow highlight | Page: 108\rWhat is this intermediate step? Just after we observe what others do and just before we feel some emotion about it, we tell ourselves a story.\nYellow highlight | Page: 108\rWe add meaning to the action we observed. We make a guess at the motive driving the behavior.\nYellow highlight | Page: 108\rWhy were they doing that? We also add judgment‚Äîis that good or bad? And then, based on these thoughts or stories, our body responds with\nYellow highlight | Page: 108\ran emotion.\nYellow highlight | Page: 109\rStories provide our rationale for\nYellow highlight | Page: 109\rwhat‚Äôs going on. They‚Äôre our interpretations of the facts. They help explain what we see and hear. They‚Äôre theories we use to explain why, how, and what. For instance, Maria asks: ‚ÄúWhy does Louis take over? He doesn‚Äôt trust my ability to communicate. He thinks that because I‚Äôm a woman, people won‚Äôt listen to me.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 111\rIf we take control of our stories, they won‚Äôt control us. People who excel at dialogue are able to influence their emotions during crucial conversations. They recognize that while it‚Äôs true that at first we are in control of the stories we tell‚Äîafter all, we do make them up of our own accord‚Äîonce they‚Äôre told, the stories control us.\nYellow highlight | Page: 111\rBut it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. We can tell different stories and break the loop. In fact, until we tell different stories, we cannot break the loop.\nYellow highlight | Page: 113\rNot only do those who are best at crucial conversations notice when they‚Äôre slipping into silence or violence, but they‚Äôre also able to admit it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 113\rThe moment they realize that they‚Äôre killing dialogue, they review their own Path to Action.\nYellow highlight | Page: 113\rActually, identifying your emotions is more difficult than you might imagine. In fact, many people are emotionally illiterate. When asked to describe how they‚Äôre feeling, they use words such as ‚Äúbad‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 113\ror ‚Äúangry‚Äù or ‚Äúfrightened‚Äù‚Äîwhich would be okay if these were accurate descriptors, but often they‚Äôre not.\nYellow highlight | Page: 113\rIndividuals say they‚Äôre angry when, in fact, they‚Äôre feeling a mix of embarrassment and surprise. Or they suggest they‚Äôre unhappy when they‚Äôre feeling violated. Perhaps they suggest they‚Äôre upset when\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rthey‚Äôre really feeling humiliated and cheated.\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rSince life doesn‚Äôt consist of a series of vocabulary tests, you might wonder what difference words can make. But words do matter. Knowing what you‚Äôre really feeling helps you take a more accurate look at what is going on and why. For instance, you‚Äôre far\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rmore likely to take an honest look at the story you‚Äôre telling yourself if you admit you‚Äôre feeling both embarrassed and surprised rather than simply angry.\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rMeaning, of course, are you telling the right story? After all, feelings come from stories, and stories are our own invention.\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rThe first step to regaining emotional control is to challenge the illusion that what you‚Äôre feeling is the only right emotion under the circumstances.\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rThis may be the hardest step, but it‚Äôs also the most important one.\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rBy questioning our feelings, we open ourselves up to question our stories. We challenge the comfortable conclusion that our story is right and true. We willingly question whether our emotions (very real), and the story behind them (only one of many possible explanations), are accurate.\nYellow highlight | Page: 115\rAs we said earlier, others could watch Maria‚Äôs interactions with Louis and walk away with different stories.\nYellow highlight | Page: 115\rTest your ideas against a simple criterion: Can you see or hear this thing you‚Äôre calling a fact? Was it an actual behavior?\nYellow highlight | Page: 115\rHowever, the statement ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt trust me‚Äù is a conclusion. It explains what you think, not what the other person did. Conclusions are subjective.\nYellow highlight | Page: 116\rEither our stories are completely accurate and propel us in healthy directions, or they‚Äôre quite inaccurate but justify our current behavior\nYellow highlight | Page: 116\rus feel good about ourselves and calling for no need to change.\nYellow highlight | Page: 116\rWe call these imaginative and self-serving concoctions ‚Äúclever stories.‚Äù They‚Äôre clever because they allow us to feel good about behaving badly. Better yet, they allow us to feel good about behaving badly even while achieving abysmal results.

Learn what the three are and how to counteract them, and you can take control of your emotional\nYellow highlight | Page: 118\rIn Victim Stories we exaggerate our own innocence. In Villain Stories we overemphasize the other person‚Äôs guilt or stupidity.\nYellow highlight | Page: 118\rWe automatically assume the worst possible motives or grossest incompetence while ignoring any possible good or neutral\nYellow highlight | Page: 118\rintentions or skills a person may have.\nYellow highlight | Page: 118\rLabeling is a common device in Villain Stories. For example, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe that bonehead gave me bad materials again.‚Äù By employing the handy label, we are now dealing not with a complex human being, but with a bonehead.\nYellow highlight | Page: 118\rAfter all, we can feel okay insulting or abusing a bonehead‚Äîwhereas we might have to be more careful with a living, breathing person.\nYellow highlight | Page: 118\rThen when we fail to get the results we really want, we stay stuck in our ineffective behavior because, after all, look who we‚Äôre dealing with!\nYellow highlight | Page: 119\rFinally come Helpless Stories. In\nYellow highlight | Page: 119\rthese fabrications we make ourselves out to be powerless to do anything healthy or helpful.\nYellow highlight | Page: 119\rWe convince ourselves that there are no healthy alternatives for dealing with our predicament, which justifies the action we‚Äôre about to take.\nYellow highlight | Page: 119\rVillain and Victim Stories look back to explain why we‚Äôre in the situation we‚Äôre in, Helpless Stories look forward to explain why we can‚Äôt do anything to change our situation.\nYellow highlight | Page: 119\rhelpless when we turn others‚Äô behavior into fixed and unchangeable traits. For example, when we decide our colleague is a ‚Äúcontrol freak‚Äù (Villain Story), we are less inclined to give her feedback because, after all, control freaks like her don‚Äôt accept feedback (Helpless Story). Nothing we can do will change that fact.\nYellow highlight | Page: 119\rAs you can see, Helpless Stories often stem from Villain Stories and typically offer us nothing more than Fool‚Äôs Choices‚Äî we can either be honest and ruin the relationship or stay silent and suffer.\nYellow highlight | Page: 119\rClever stories match reality.\nYellow highlight | Page: 120\rClever stories get us off the hook.\nYellow highlight | Page: 121\rYour spouse‚Äôs annoying habit didn‚Äôt become a source of resentment until you became part of the problem.\nYellow highlight | Page: 122\rOnce we‚Äôve learned to recognize the clever stories we tell ourselves, we can move to the final Master My Stories skill. The dialogue-smart\nYellow highlight | Page: 122\rrecognize that they‚Äôre telling clever stories, stop, and then do what it takes to tell a useful story. A useful story, by definition, creates emotions that lead to healthy action‚Äîsuch as dialogue.\nYellow highlight | Page: 123\r‚Ä¢ Am I pretending not to notice my role in the problem? This question jars you into facing up to the fact that maybe, just maybe, you did something to help cause the problem.\nYellow highlight | Page: 123\rPerhaps your contribution was merely a thoughtless omission. Nonetheless, you contributed.\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rTurn villains into humans. When you find yourself labeling or otherwise vilifying others, stop and ask:\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\r‚Ä¢ Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do what this person is doing? This particular question humanizes others. As we search for plausible answers to it, our emotions soften. Empathy often replaces judgment, and depending upon how we‚Äôve treated others, personal accountability replaces self-justification.\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rWhy would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do what this person is doing?\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rAs we search for plausible answers to it, our emotions soften.

And if you do, don‚Äôt you run the risk of ruining a relationship?\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rThe purpose of the humanizing question is to deal with our own stories and emotions. It provides us with still another tool for working on ourselves first by providing a variety of possible reasons for the other person‚Äôs behavior.\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rIn fact, with experience and maturity we learn to worry less about others‚Äô intent and more about the effect others‚Äô actions are having on us.\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rAnd here‚Äôs the good news. When we reflect on alternative motives, not only do we soften our emotions, but equally important, we relax our absolute certainty long enough to allow for dialogue‚Äî the only reliable way of discovering others‚Äô genuine motives.\nYellow highlight | Page: 125\rTurn the helpless into the able. Finally, when you catch yourself bemoaning your own helplessness, you can tell the complete story by returning to your original motive. To do so, stop and ask:\nYellow highlight | Page: 125\rWhat do I really want? For me? For others? For the relationship? Then, kill the Fool‚Äôs Choice that‚Äôs made you feel helpless to choose anything other than silence or violence. Do this by asking:\nYellow highlight | Page: 125\r‚Ä¢ What would I do right now if I really wanted these results?\nYellow highlight | Page: 125\rWhat would I do right now if I really wanted these results?\nYellow highlight | Page: 125\rWhen you refuse to make yourself helpless, you‚Äôre forced to hold yourself accountable for using your dialogue skills rather than bemoaning your weakness.\nYellow highlight | Page: 126\rAs we tell the rest of the story, we free ourselves from the poisoning effects of unhealthy emotions. Best of all, as we regain control and move back to dialogue, we become masters of our own emotions rather than hostages.\nYellow highlight | Page: 128\rAs soon as she shows signs of frustration, I stop and remind her that I am on her side.\nYellow highlight | Page: 131\rSo far we‚Äôve gone to great pains to prepare ourselves to step up to and master crucial conversations. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve learned. Our hearts need to be in the right place. We need to pay close attention to crucial conversations‚Äîparticularly when people start feeling unsafe‚Äîand restore safety when necessary. And heaven forbid that we should tell ourselves clever and unhelpful stories.\nYellow highlight | Page: 131\rMost of the time, we walk into a discussion and slide into autopilot. ‚ÄúHi, how are the kids? What‚Äôs going on at work?‚Äù What could be easier than talking? We know thousands of words and generally weave them into sentences that suit our needs. Most of the time.\nYellow highlight | Page: 132\rHowever, when stakes rise and our emotions kick in, well, that‚Äôs when we open our mouths and don‚Äôt do so well.\nYellow highlight | Page: 132\rIn fact, as we suggested earlier, the more important the discussion, the less likely we are to be on our best behavior. More specifically, we advocate or express our views quite poorly.\nYellow highlight | Page: 132\r‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Marta, but people simply don‚Äôt like working with you. You‚Äôve been asked to leave the special-projects team.‚Äù It‚Äôs one thing to argue that your company needs to shift from green to red packaging; it‚Äôs quite another to tell a person that he or she is offensive or unlikable. When the topic turns from things to people, it‚Äôs always more difficult, and to nobody‚Äôs surprise, some people are better at it than others.\nYellow highlight | Page: 133\rThe best at dialogue speak their minds completely and do it in a way that makes it safe for others to hear what they have to say and respond to it as well.\nYellow highlight | Page: 133\rThey are both totally frank and completely respectful.\nYellow highlight | Page: 133\rif you know how to carefully blend three ingredients‚Äîconfidence, humility, and skill.\nYellow highlight | Page: 133\rPeople who are skilled at dialogue have the confidence to say what needs to be said to the person who needs to hear it. They are confident that their opinions deserve to be placed in the pool of meaning. They are also confident that they can speak openly without brutalizing others or causing undue offense.\nYellow highlight | Page: 133\rSkilled people are confident that they have something to say, but also realize that others have valuable input. They are humble enough to realize that they don‚Äôt have a monopoly on the truth nor do they always have to win their way.\nYellow highlight | Page: 134\rThis means they‚Äôre willing to both express their opinions and encourage others to do the same. Skill. Finally, people who willingly share delicate information are good at doing it. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre confident in the first place. They don‚Äôt make a Fool‚Äôs Choice, because they‚Äôve found a path that allows for both candor and safety. They speak the unspeakable, and people are grateful for their honesty.\nYellow highlight | Page: 134\rmoving back to Australia)? What‚Äôs the worst way of talking about the problem? Most people agree that jumping in with an ugly accusation followed by a threat is a good candidate for that distinction. It‚Äôs also what most people do, and Carole is no exception.\nYellow highlight | Page: 136\rShare your facts ‚Ä¢ Tell your story ‚Ä¢ Ask for others‚Äô paths ‚Ä¢ Talk tentatively ‚Ä¢ Encourage testing\nYellow highlight | Page: 137\rOf course, starting with our ugly stories is the most controversial, least influential, and most insulting way we could begin.\nYellow highlight | Page: 138\rit. We hold it inside where the story builds up steam, and when we do eventually share our horrific story, we do so with a vengeance. The cycle starts all over again.\nYellow highlight | Page: 138\rFacts are the least controversial. Facts provide a safe beginning. By their very nature, facts aren‚Äôt controversial. That‚Äôs why we call them facts. For example, consider the statement: ‚ÄúYesterday you arrived at work twenty minutes late.‚Äù No dispute there. Conclusions, on the other hand, are highly controversial. For example: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be trusted.‚Äù That‚Äôs hardly a fact. Actually, it‚Äôs more like an insult, and\nYellow highlight | Page: 138\rFacts are the most persuasive. In addition to being less controversial, facts are also more persuasive than subjective conclusions. Facts form the foundation of belief. So if you want to persuade others, don‚Äôt start with your stories. Start with your observations. For example, which of the following do you find more persuasive?\nYellow highlight | Page: 138\r‚ÄúI want you to stop sexually harassing me!‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhen you talk to me, your eyes move up and down rather than look at my face. And sometimes you put your hand on my shoulder.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 139\rWhen we start with shocking or offensive conclusions (‚ÄúQuit groping me with your eyes!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI think we should declare bankruptcy‚Äù), we actually encourage others to tell Villain Stories about us. Since we‚Äôve given them no facts to\nYellow highlight | Page: 139\rsupport our conclusion, they make up reasons we‚Äôre saying these things. They‚Äôre likely to believe we‚Äôre either stupid or evil.\nYellow highlight | Page: 139\rAnd if you aren‚Äôt sure what your facts are (your story is absolutely filling your brain), take the time to think them through before you enter the crucial conversation. Take the time to sort out facts from conclusions. Gathering the facts is the homework required for crucial conversations. Facts are the least insulting. If you do want to share your story, don‚Äôt start with it. Your story (particularly if it has led to a rather ugly conclusion) could easily surprise and insult others. It could kill safety in one rash, ill-conceived sentence.\nYellow highlight | Page: 140\rBegin your path with facts. In order to talk about your stories, you need to lead the others involved down your Path to Action. Let them experience your path from the beginning to the end, and not from the end to‚Äîwell, to wherever\nYellow highlight | Page: 140\rEarn the right to share your story by starting with your facts. Facts lay the groundwork for all delicate conversations.\nYellow highlight | Page: 140\rSharing your story can be tricky. Even if you‚Äôve started with your facts, the other person can still become defensive when you move from facts to stories. After all, you‚Äôre sharing potentially unflattering conclusions and judgments.\nYellow highlight | Page: 141\r(Sounds like it‚Äôs time for a conclusion.) ‚ÄúI was wondering what the software is doing in your briefcase. It looks like you‚Äôre taking it home. Is that what‚Äôs going on here?‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 141\rIt takes confidence. To be honest, it can be difficult to share negative conclusions and unattractive judgments (e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wondering if you‚Äôre a thief‚Äù). It takes confidence to share such a potentially inflammatory story. However, if you‚Äôve done your homework by thinking through the facts behind your story, you‚Äôll realize that you are drawing\nYellow highlight | Page: 141\rBy thinking through the facts and then leading with them, you‚Äôre much more likely to have the confidence you need to add controversial and vitally important meaning to the shared pool.\nYellow highlight | Page: 142\rLook for safety problems. As you share your story, watch for signs that safety is deteriorating. If people start becoming defensive or appear to be insulted, step out of the conversation and rebuild safety by Contrasting.\nYellow highlight | Page: 143\rBe careful not to apologize for your views. Remember, the goal of Contrasting is not to water down your message, but to be sure that people don‚Äôt hear more than you intend. Be confident enough to share what you really want to\nYellow highlight | Page: 144\rOne of the ironies of dialogue is that, when talking with those holding opposing opinions, the more convinced and forceful you act, the more resistant others become. Speaking in absolute and overstated terms does not increase your influence, it decreases it. The converse is also true‚Äîthe more tentatively you speak, the more open people become to your opinions.\nYellow highlight | Page: 145\r‚ÄúIt‚Äôs starting to look like you‚Äôre\nYellow highlight | Page: 145\r‚ÄúIt‚Äôs leading me to conclude that you‚Äôre\nYellow highlight | Page: 145\rstarting to use drugs.

Some people make Fool‚Äôs Choices in these circumstances. They worry that if they share their true opinions, others will clam up. So they choose between speaking their minds and hearing others out. But the best at dialogue don‚Äôt choose. They do both. They understand that the only limit to how strongly you can express your opinion is your willingness to be equally vigorous in encouraging others to challenge\nYellow highlight | Page: 146\rInvite opposing views. So if you think others may be hesitant, make it clear that you want to hear their views‚Äîno matter how different. If others disagree, so much the better.\nYellow highlight | Page: 147\r‚ÄúDoes anyone see it differently?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat am I missing here?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôd\nYellow highlight | Page: 147\rreally like to hear the other side of this story.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 147\rMean it. Sometimes people offer an invitation that sounds more like a threat than a legitimate call for opinions. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs how I see it. Nobody disagrees, do they?‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 147\rPlay devil‚Äôs advocate. Occasionally you can tell that others are not buying into your facts or story, but they‚Äôre not speaking up either. You‚Äôve sincerely invited them, even encouraged differing views, but nobody says anything. To help grease the skids, play devil‚Äôs advocate. Model disagreeing by disagreeing with your own view. ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm wrong here. What if the opposite is true? What if the reason sales have dropped is because\nYellow highlight | Page: 148\rIt‚Äôs just that it might help put my mind to rest if we were to check on this right now.\nYellow highlight | Page: 150\rIt starts with a story. When we feel the need to push our ideas on others, it‚Äôs generally because we believe we‚Äôre right and everyone else is wrong. There‚Äôs no need to expand the pool of meaning, because we own the pool. We also firmly believe it‚Äôs our duty to fight for the truth that we‚Äôre holding. It‚Äôs the honorable thing to do. It‚Äôs what people of character do.\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rWe use debating tricks that we‚Äôve picked up throughout the years. Chief among them is the ability to ‚Äústack the deck.‚Äù We cite information that supports our ideas while hiding or discrediting anything that doesn‚Äôt.\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rThen we spice things up with exaggeration: ‚ÄúEveryone knows that this is the only way to go.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rWhen this doesn‚Äôt work, we lace our language with inflammatory terms: ‚ÄúAll right-thinking people would agree with me.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rWe appeal to authority: ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs what the boss thinks.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rWe draw hasty generalizations:\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rAnd again, the harder we try and the more forceful and nasty our tactics, the greater the resistance we create, the worse the results, and the more battered our relationships.\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rWhen you find yourself just dying to convince others that your way is best, back off your current attack and think about what you really want for yourself, others, and the relationship. Then ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow would I behave if these were the results I really wanted?‚Äù When your adrenaline level gets below the 0.05 legal limit, you‚Äôll be able to use your STATE skills.\nYellow highlight | Page: 152\rFirst, Learn to Look. Watch for the moment when people start to resist you‚Äîperhaps they begin to raise their volume and/or overstate the facts behind their views in reaction to your tactics‚Äîor perhaps they retreat into silence. Turn your attention away from the topic (no matter how important) and onto yourself. Are you leaning forward? Are you speaking more loudly? Are you starting to try to win? Are you speaking in lengthy monologues and using dirty tricks? Remember: The more you care about an issue, the less likely you are to be on your best behavior.\nYellow highlight | Page: 152\rOf course, this isn‚Äôt easy. Backing off when we care the most is so counterintuitive that most of us have trouble doing so. It‚Äôs not easy to soften your language when you‚Äôre positive about something. And who wants to ask for other views when you know they‚Äôre wrong? That‚Äôs positively nuts.\nYellow highlight | Page: 152\rLet‚Äôs face it. When it comes to our strongest views, passion can be our enemy. Of course, feeling strongly about something isn‚Äôt bad in and of itself. It‚Äôs okay to have strong opinions. The problem comes when we try to express them.\nYellow highlight | Page: 153\rCatch yourself. So what‚Äôs a person to do? Catch yourself before you launch into a monologue. Realize that if you‚Äôre starting to feel indignant or if you can‚Äôt figure out why others don‚Äôt buy in‚Äîafter all, it‚Äôs so obvious to you‚Äîrecognize that you‚Äôre starting to enter dangerous territory. Back off your harsh and conclusive language. But don‚Äôt back off your belief. Hold to your belief; merely soften your approach.\nYellow highlight | Page: 157\rwhen most people become furious, we need to become curious. Rather than respond in kind, we need to wonder what‚Äôs behind the ruckus.\nBlue highlight | Page: 157\rBut how? How can we possibly act curious when others are either attacking us or heading for cover? People who routinely seek to find out why others are feeling unsafe do so because they have learned that getting at the source of fear and discomfort is the best way to return to dialogue.\nYellow highlight | Page: 157\rEither they‚Äôve seen others do it or they‚Äôve stumbled on the formula themselves. Either way, they realize that the cure to silence or violence isn‚Äôt to respond in kind, but to get at the underlying source. This calls for genuine curiosity‚Äîat a time when you‚Äôre likely to be feeling frustrated or angry.\nBlue highlight | Page: 158\rStay curious. When people begin to share their volatile stories and feelings, we now face the risk of pulling out our own Victim, Villain, and Helpless Stories to help us explain why they‚Äôre saying what they‚Äôre saying. Unfortunately, since it‚Äôs rarely fun to hear other people‚Äôs unflattering stories, we begin to assign negative motives to them for telling the stories. For example:\nBlue highlight | Page: 159\rTo avoid overreacting to others‚Äô stories, stay curious. Give your brain a problem to stay focused on. Ask: ‚ÄúWhy would a reasonable, rational, and decent person say this?‚Äù This question keeps you retracing the other person‚Äôs Path to Action until you see how it all fits together. And in most\nBlue highlight | Page: 159\rBe patient. When others are acting out their feelings and opinions through silence or violence, it‚Äôs a good bet they‚Äôre starting to feel the effects of adrenaline. Even if we do our best to safely and effectively respond to the other person‚Äôs verbal attack, we still have to face up to the fact that it‚Äôs going to take a little while for him or her to settle down. Say, for example, that a friend dumps out an ugly story and you treat it with respect and continue on with the conversation. Even if the two of you now share a similar view, it may seem like your friend is still pushing too hard. While it‚Äôs natural to move quickly from one thought to the next, strong emotions take a while to subside. Once the chemicals that fuel emotions are released, they hang around in the bloodstream for a time‚Äîin some cases, long after thoughts have changed.\nBlue highlight | Page: 159\rSo be patient when exploring how others think and feel. Encourage them to share their path and then wait for their emotions to catch up with the safety that you‚Äôve created.\nYellow highlight | Page: 159\rOnce you‚Äôve decided to maintain a curious approach, it‚Äôs time to help the other person retrace his or her Path to Action. Unfortunately, most of us fail to do so. That‚Äôs because when others start playing silence or violence games, we‚Äôre joining the conversation at the end of their Path to Action. They‚Äôve seen and heard things, told themselves a story or two, generated a feeling (possibly a mix of fear and anger or disappointment), and now they‚Äôre starting to act out their story. That‚Äôs where we come in. Now, even though we may be hearing their first words, we‚Äôre coming in somewhere near the end of their path. On the Path to\nYellow highlight | Page: 160\rEvery sentence has a history.\nBlue highlight | Page: 161\rBreak the cycle. And then guess what happens? When we‚Äôre on the receiving end of someone‚Äôs retributions, accusations, and cheap shots, rarely do we think: ‚ÄúMy, what an interesting story he or she must have told.

[Ask]\nBlue highlight | Page: 170\rAs you watch families and work groups take part in heated debates, it‚Äôs common to notice a rather intriguing phenomenon. Although the various parties you‚Äôre observing are violently arguing, in truth, they‚Äôre in violent agreement. They actually agree on every important point, but they‚Äôre still fighting. They‚Äôve found a way to turn subtle differences into a raging debate.\nBlue highlight | Page: 171\rMost arguments consist of battles over the 5 to 10 percent of the facts and stories that people disagree over. And while it‚Äôs true that people eventually need to work through differences, you shouldn‚Äôt start there. Start with an area of agreement.\nBlue highlight | Page: 171\rSo here‚Äôs the take-away. If you completely agree with the other person‚Äôs path, say so and move on. Agree when you agree. Don‚Äôt turn an agreement into an argument.\nBlue highlight | Page: 171\rOf course, the reason most of us turn agreements into debates is because we disagree with a certain portion of what the other person has said. Never mind that it‚Äôs a minor portion. If it‚Äôs a point of disagreement, we‚Äôll jump all over it like a fleeing criminal.\nBlue highlight | Page: 171\rit first is even better. And of course, having it first after others are wrong endows you with an even greater glory! Over time you find that finding even the tiniest of errors in others‚Äô facts, thinking, or logic reinforces your supreme place in the spotlight of teacher and peer admiration. So you point out their errors. Being right at the expense of others becomes skillful sport.\nBlue highlight | Page: 171\rOn the other hand, when you watch people who are skilled in dialogue, it becomes clear that they‚Äôre not playing this everyday game of Trivial Pursuit‚Äîlooking for trivial differences and then proclaiming them aloud. In fact, they‚Äôre looking for points of agreement. As a result, they‚Äôll often start with the words ‚ÄúI agree.‚Äù Then they talk about the part they agree with. At least, that‚Äôs where they start.\nBlue highlight | Page: 172\rNow when the other person has merely left out an element of the argument, skilled people will agree and then build. Rather than saying: ‚ÄúWrong. You forgot to mention . . .,‚Äù they say: ‚ÄúAbsolutely. In addition, I noticed that. .\nBlue highlight | Page: 172\rIf you agree with what has been said but the information is incomplete, build. Point out areas of agreement, and\nBlue highlight | Page: 172\rthen add elements that were left out of the discussion.\nBlue highlight | Page: 172\rFinally, if you do disagree, compare your path with the other person‚Äôs. That is, rather than suggesting that he or she is wrong, suggest that you differ. He or she may, in fact, be wrong, but you don‚Äôt know for sure until you hear both sides of the story. For now, you just know that the two of you differ. So instead of pronouncing ‚ÄúWrong!‚Äù start with a tentative but candid opening, such as ‚ÄúI think I see things differently. Let me describe how.‚Äù\nBlue highlight | Page: 172\rIn summary, to help remember these skills, think of your ABCs. Agree when you agree. Build when others leave out key pieces. Compare when you differ. Don‚Äôt turn differences into debates that lead to unhealthy relationships and bad results.\nBlue highlight | Page: 178\rThey have unclear expectations about how decisions will be made.\nBlue highlight | Page: 178\r‚Ä¢ They do a poor job of acting on the decisions they do make. This\nBlue highlight | Page: 179\rBoth of these problems are solved if, before making a decision, the people involved decide how to decide. Don‚Äôt allow people to assume that dialogue is decision making. Dialogue is a process for getting all relevant meaning into a shared pool. That process, of course, involves everyone. However, simply because everyone is allowed to share their meaning‚Äîactually encouraged to share their meaning‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt mean they are then guaranteed to take part in making all the decisions. To avoid violated expectations, separate dialogue from decision making. Make it clear how decisions will be made‚Äîwho will be involved and why.\nBlue highlight | Page: 179\rWhen the line of authority isn‚Äôt clear. When there is no clear line of authority, deciding how to decide can be quite difficult.\nBlue highlight | Page: 180\rDon‚Äôt mention lawyers or a lawsuit in your opening comments; this only reduces safety and sets up an adversarial climate.\nBlue highlight | Page: 180\rThere are four common ways of making decisions: command, consult, vote, and consensus.\nBlue highlight | Page: 181\rConsulting is a process whereby decision makers invite others to influence them before they make their choice.\nBlue highlight | Page: 182\rConsensus This method can be both a great blessing and a frustrating curse. Consensus means you talk until everyone honestly agrees to one decision. This method can produce tremendous unity and high-quality decisions. If misapplied, it can also be a horrible waste of time. It should only be used with (1) high-stakes and complex issues or (2) issues where everyone absolutely must support the final choice.\nBlue highlight | Page: 184\rBe sure to spell out the exact deliverables you have in mind. The fuzzier the expectations, the higher the likelihood of disappointment.\nBlue highlight | Page: 185\rassignment, clarify up front the exact details of what you want. Couples get into trouble in this area when one of the parties doesn‚Äôt want to take the time to think carefully about the ‚Äúdeliverables‚Äù and then later on becomes upset because his or her unstated desires weren‚Äôt met. Have you ever remodeled a room with a loved one? Then you know what we‚Äôre talking about. Better to spend the time up front clarifying exactly what you want rather than waste resources and hurt feelings on the back end.\nBlue highlight | Page: 186\rIt‚Äôs shocking how often people leave this element out of an assignment. Instead of giving a deadline, people simply point to the setting sun of ‚Äúsomeday.‚Äù With vague or unspoken deadlines, other urgencies come up, and the assignment finds its way to the bottom of the pile, where it is soon forgotten. Assignments without deadlines are far better at producing guilt than stimulating action. Goals without deadlines aren‚Äôt goals; they‚Äôre merely directions.\nBlue highlight | Page: 186\rRemember, if you want people to feel accountable, you must give them an opportunity to account. Build an expectation for follow-up into every assignment.\nBlue highlight | Page: 186\rOnce again, a proverb comes to mind. ‚ÄúOne dull pencil is worth six sharp minds.‚Äù\nBlue highlight | Page: 191\rWhen you feel a measure of respect for the other person, you‚Äôre ready to begin.

In an article largely overlooked since it was published in 2002, they described how they were able to draw website visitors‚Äô attention to the goal of comfort merely by placing fluffy clouds on the background wallpaper of the site‚Äôs landing page. That maneuver led those visitors to assign elevated levels of importance to comfort when asked what they were looking for in a sofa. Those same visitors also became more likely to search the site for information about the comfort features of the sofas in stock and, most notably, to choose a more comfortable (and more costly) sofa as their preferred purchase. To make sure their results were due to the landing page wallpaper and not to some general human preference for comfort, Mandel and Johnson reversed their procedure for other visitors, who saw wallpaper that pulled their attention to the goal of economy by depicting pennies instead of clouds. These visitors assigned greater levels of importance to price, searched the site primarily for cost information, and preferred an inexpensive sofa.\nYellow highlight | Location: 997\rThe outcomes were always the same: whomever‚Äôs face was more visible was judged to be more causal.\nYellow highlight | Location: 999\rwhat‚Äôs-focal-is-presumed-causal\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,381\r‚ÄúYou use your cuts to get people to swing attention to the parts of your message you really want them to focus on.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,536\rtactics such as setting up a specific time to write every day, limiting distractions during that time, and\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,540\rShe never lets herself finish a writing session at the end of a paragraph or even a thought.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,541\rBy keeping the final feature of every writing session near-finished, she\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,542\ruses the motivating force of the drive for closure to get her back to her chair quickly, impatient to write again.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,629\rbest ways to enhance audience acceptance of one‚Äôs message is to reduce the availability of strong counterarguments to it‚Äî because counterarguments are typically more powerful than arguments.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,642\r‚Äúthe most beautiful thing we can experience‚Äù and ‚Äúthe source of all true science and art.‚Äù His contention: the mysterious.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,670\rthe main purpose of speech is to direct listeners‚Äô attention to a selected sector of\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,704\rWe don‚Äôt attack a problem, we approach it.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,705\rthe nonviolent-language policy.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,706\rAnd one of those goals is no longer to beat our competition; it‚Äôs to outdistance or outpace them.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,709\rI was skeptical that such small wording shifts would affect the thinking\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,714\rHe who wants to persuade should put his trust not in the right argument, but in the right word.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,749\rIf you want to change the world, change the metaphor.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,751\rThey‚Äôve been told that an effective way to convey a somewhat elusive concept to an audience is to describe it in terms of another concept that the audience can recognize readily.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,752\rLong-distance runners, for instance, recount the experience of being unable to continue a race as ‚Äúhitting the wall.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,762\rRecall that new psycholinguistic analysis suggests that the main function of language is not to express or describe but to influence‚Äîsomething it does by channeling recipients to sectors of reality pre-loaded with a set of mental associations favorable to the communicator‚Äôs view.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,822\r‚Äúused‚Äù‚Äîwhich links to notions of wear and tear‚Äîbut to say ‚Äúpreowned,‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,061\rDr.¬†Sonja Lyubomirsky\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,068\r‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt all bleak,‚Äù she wrote in her 2013 book, The Myths of Happiness, ‚Äúbut if I knew then what I know now, my family would have been better positioned to make the best of it.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,172\rsteering attention from one feature of a person‚Äôs inner geography to another can affect performance,\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,187\rthat by guiding preliminary attention strategically, it‚Äôs possible for a communicator to move recipients into agreement with a message before they experience it.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,194\runderappreciated characteristic of mental activity: its elements don‚Äôt just fire when ready; they fire when readied.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,474\rThey are reciprocation, liking, social proof, authority, scarcity, and consistency.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,546\rthey did something for him that was meaningful, unexpected, and customized:\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,567\rWe were instructed to highlight similarities and provide compliments.

The authors described a state of affairs that seemed to make no sense and then invited the reader into the material as a way of solving the mystery.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 81\rMysteries are powerful, Cialdini says, because they create a need for closure. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve heard of the famous Aha! experience, right?‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWell, the Aha! experience is much more satisfying when it is preceded by the Huh? experience.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 81\rCialdini began to create mysteries in his own classroom, and the power of the approach quickly became clear.\nYellow highlight | Page: 81\r‚ÄúNormally five to ten minutes before the scheduled end time, some students start preparing to leave. You know the signals‚Äîpencils are put away, notebooks folded, backpacks zipped up.‚Äù\nBlue highlight | Page: 82\rCialdini believes that a major benefit of teaching using mysteries is that ‚Äúthe process of resolving mysteries is remarkably similar to the process of science.‚Äù So, by using mysteries, teachers don‚Äôt just heighten students‚Äô interest in the day‚Äôs material; they train them to think like scientists.\nBlue highlight | Page: 82\rMystery is created not from an unexpected moment but from an unexpected journey. We know where we‚Äôre headed‚Äîwe want to solve the mystery‚Äîbut we‚Äôre not sure how we‚Äôll get there.\nBlue highlight | Page: 83\rMcKee says, ‚ÄúCuriosity11 is the intellectual need to answer questions and close open patterns. Story plays to this universal desire by doing the opposite, posing questions and opening situations.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 83\rIn McKee‚Äôs view, a great script is designed so that every scene is a Turning Point. ‚ÄúEach Turning Point hooks curiosity. The audience wonders, What will happen next? and How will it turn out?\nYellow highlight | Page: 83\rMcKee notes that the How will it turn out? question is powerful enough to keep us watching even when we know better. ‚ÄúThink of all the bad films you‚Äôve sat through just to get the answer to that nagging question.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 84\rIn 1994, George Loewenstein,12 a behavioral economist at Carnegie Mellon University, provided the most comprehensive account of situational interest. It is surprisingly simple. Curiosity, he says, happens when we feel a gap in our knowledge.\nYellow highlight | Page: 84\rLoewenstein argues that gaps cause pain.\nYellow highlight | Page: 85\r‚ÄúStory works by posing questions and opening situations.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 85\rPok√©mon cards cause kids to wonder, Which characters am I missing?\nYellow highlight | Page: 85\rOne important implication of the gap theory is that we need to open gaps before we close them. Our tendency is to tell people the facts. First, though, they must realize that they need these facts. The trick to convincing people that they need our message, according to Loewenstein, is to first highlight some specific knowledge that they‚Äôre missing. We can pose a question or puzzle that confronts people with a gap in their knowledge.\nYellow highlight | Page: 85\rWe can point out that someone else knows something they don‚Äôt. We can present them with situations that have unknown resolutions, such as elections, sports events, or mysteries. We can challenge them to predict an outcome (which creates two knowledge gaps‚ÄîWhat will happen? and Was I right?).\nBlue highlight | Page: 85\rThey work because they tease you with something that you don‚Äôt know‚Äîin fact, something that you didn‚Äôt care about at all, until you found out that you didn‚Äôt know it. ‚ÄúIs my daughter strung out on one of my old prescriptions? I wonder if I ate at the restaurant with the slime?\nBlue highlight | Page: 86\rIn improving this message, we need to think about how to elicit interest rather than force-feeding facts.\nYellow highlight | Page: 87\rThis approach is inspired by the gap theory. The goal is not to summarize; it‚Äôs to make you care about knowing something, and then to tell you what you want to know.\nBlue highlight | Page: 87\rThe improvement here is driven by structure, not content. Let‚Äôs face it, this is not a particularly interesting mystery. It would never make an episode of Law \u0026amp; Order. But our minds are extremely generous when it comes to mysteries‚Äîthe format is inherently appealing.\nYellow highlight | Page: 88\rThe news-teaser approach can be used with all sorts of ideas in all sorts of contexts. To make our communications more effective, we need to shift our thinking from ‚ÄúWhat information do I need to convey?‚Äù to ‚ÄúWhat questions do I want my audience to ask?‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 88\rknow. One complication is that people tend to think they know a lot.\nYellow highlight | Page: 88\rIf people believe they know everything, it‚Äôs hard to make the gap theory work. Fortunately, there are strategies for combating overconfidence. For instance, Nora Ephron‚Äôs journalism teacher prevented overconfidence by causing the students‚Äô schemas of journalism to fail. He made them commit to their preconceived ideas and then pulled the rug out from under them.\nBlue highlight | Page: 88\rMaking people commit to a prediction can help prevent overconfidence.\nYellow highlight | Page: 89\rEric Mazur, a physics professor at Harvard, came up with a pedagogical innovation known as ‚Äúconcept testing.‚Äù Every so often in his classes, Mazur will pose a conceptual question and then ask his students to vote publicly on the answer. The simple act of committing to an answer makes the students more engaged and more curious about the outcome.\nYellow highlight | Page: 89\rThe thirst to fill a knowledge gap‚Äîto find out who was right‚Äîcan be more powerful than the thirst for slides and jungle gyms.\nYellow highlight | Page: 89\rIf curiosity arises from knowledge gaps, we might assume that when we know more, we‚Äôll become less curious because there are fewer gaps in our knowledge.\nYellow highlight | Page: 89\rBut Loewenstein argues that the opposite is true. He says that as we gain\nYellow highlight | Page: 89\rinformation we are more and more likely to focus on what we don‚Äôt know. Someone who knows the state capitals of 17 of 50 states may be proud of her knowledge. But someone who knows 47 may be more likely to think of herself as not knowing 3 capitals.\nYellow highlight | Page: 90\rHuman-interest stories are fascinating because we know what it‚Äôs like to be human‚Äîbut we don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to have certain dramatic experiences.\nYellow highlight | Page: 90\rGossip is popular because we know a lot about some people but there‚Äôs some information that we lack.\nBlue highlight | Page: 91\rThe trick, Arledge said, was to give people enough context about the game so that they‚Äôd start to care.\nYellow highlight | Page: 91\rArledge intuitively made use of Loewenstein‚Äôs gap theory. How do you get people interested in a topic? You point out a gap in their knowledge. But what if they lack so much knowledge about, say, the Georgia Bulldogs, that they‚Äôve got more of an abyss than a gap? In that case, you have to fill in enough knowledge to make the abyss into a gap.\nYellow highlight | Page: 92\rThe tool kit he developed for NCAA football stood the test of time. The way to get people to care is to provide context. Today that seems obvious, because these techniques have become ubiquitous. But this avalanche of context started because a twenty-nine-year-old wrote a memo about how to make college football more interesting.\nYellow highlight | Page: 92\rKnowledge gaps create interest. But to prove that the knowledge gaps exist, it may be necessary to highlight some knowledge first.\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\r‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what you know. Now here‚Äôs what you‚Äôre missing.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\rAlternatively, you can set context so people care what comes next.\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\rUnexpected ideas, by opening a knowledge gap, tease and flirt.\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\rThey mark a big red X on something that needs to be discovered but don‚Äôt necessarily tell you how to get there.\nYellow highlight | Page: 96\rIn Kennedy‚Äôs address to Congress, he outlined a series of requests to help the United States maintain its leadership during the Cold War. He asked for funds to achieve a number of strategic goals: to establish the AID program for international development, to expand the NATO alliance, to build radio and television stations in Latin America and Southeast Asia, and to shore up civil defense.\nYellow highlight | Page: 96\rnext, the ideas give us a sudden, dramatic glimpse of how the world might unfold. And not just how but why.\nYellow highlight | Page: 96\rit‚Äôs important to remember that knowledge gaps are painful. ‚ÄúIf people like curiosity,15 why do they work to resolve it?\nYellow highlight | Page: 97\rWhen we‚Äôre skeptical about our ability to get people‚Äôs attention, or our ability to keep people‚Äôs attention, we should draw inspiration from Kennedy and Ibuka. And, on a smaller scale, from Nora Ephron‚Äôs journalism teacher and Nordstrom‚Äôs managers. Unexpectedness, in the service of core principles, can have surprising longevity.\nYellow highlight | Page: 99\rClearly, Aesop was illustrating a universal human shortcoming. The fable would not have survived for more than 2,500 years if it didn‚Äôt reflect some profound truth about human nature.\nYellow highlight | Page: 99\rThis truth is especially sticky because of the way it was encoded. The concrete images evoked by the fable‚Äîthe grapes, the fox, the dismissive comment about sour grapes‚Äîallowed its message to persist.\nYellow highlight | Page: 99\rOur favorite from medicine: ‚Äúidiopathic cardiomyopathy.‚Äù ‚ÄúCardiomyopathy‚Äù means something is wrong with your heart, and ‚Äúidiopathic‚Äù means ‚Äúwe have no idea why yours isn‚Äôt working.\nBlue highlight | Page: 99\rLanguage is often abstract, but life is not abstract. Teachers teach students about battles and animals and books. Doctors repair problems with our stomachs, backs, and hearts. Companies create software, build planes, distribute newspapers; they build cars that are cheaper, faster, or fancier than last year‚Äôs. Even the most abstract business strategy must eventually show up in the tangible actions of human beings. It‚Äôs easier to understand those tangible actions than to understand an abstract strategy statement‚Äîjust as it‚Äôs easier to understand a fox dissing some grapes than an abstract commentary about the human psyche.\nYellow highlight | Page: 100\rCalifornia is one of only five Mediterranean climate regions in the world. (The others are the fynbos of South Africa, the matorral of Chile, the kwongan of Australia, and, of course, the Mediterranean.) These Mediterranean climate zones occupy only 2 percent of the world‚Äôs landmass but host more than 20 percent of its plant species. If you want to buy environmentally precious land, Mediterranean climates give you a lot of bang for your buck.\nBlue highlight | Page: 101\rThese new strategies made sense‚ÄîTNC could protect more areas than it could reach through ‚Äúbucks and acres.‚Äù But they also had drawbacks. First, they were much less concrete to donors. Donors can‚Äôt ‚Äúwalk around on‚Äù a favorable government regulation. Second, they were also potentially demoralizing for employees‚Äîthey made progress less tangible. When\nBlue highlight | Page: 101\rTNC was focused on land deals, Sweeney said, ‚Äúit was easy to celebrate a deal closing, to tell everyone, ‚ÄòJohn and Mary got this land,‚Äô and to pat them on the back.‚Äù These ‚Äúmilestone moments,‚Äù so great for morale, were harder to find in the new model. How could TNC make the new strategy more concrete?\nBlue highlight | Page: 103\rTNC named the oak savanna the Mount Hamilton Wilderness (based on its highest peak, the site of a local observatory). Identifying the area as a coherent landscape and naming it put it on the map for local groups and policymakers.\nBlue highlight | Page: 103\rtangible. But when you say, ‚ÄòThe Mount Hamilton Wilderness,‚Äô their interest perks up.\nYellow highlight | Page: 103\rThe Mount Hamilton Wilderness is not a set of acres; it‚Äôs an eco-celebrity.\nYellow highlight | Page: 103\rThis is not a story about land; it‚Äôs a story about abstraction. TNC avoided the trap of abstraction‚Äîsaving 2 million acres per year‚Äîby converting abstract blobs on a map into tangible landscapes.\nYellow highlight | Page: 104\rConcreteness is an indispensable component of sticky ideas.\nYellow highlight | Page: 104\r‚ÄúUnexpected‚Äù chapter, we talked about Nordstrom‚Äôs world-class customer service. ‚ÄúWorld-class customer service‚Äù is abstract. A Nordie ironing a customer‚Äôs shirt is concrete.\nYellow highlight | Page: 104\rConcrete language helps people, especially novices, understand new concepts. Abstraction is the luxury of the expert.\nYellow highlight | Page: 104\rIf you‚Äôve got to teach an idea to a room full of people, and you aren‚Äôt certain what they know, concreteness is the only safe language.\nPink highlight | Page: 107\rYale researcher Eric Havelock3 studies tales that have been passed down by word of mouth, such as the Iliad and the Odyssey. He notes that these tales are characterized by lots of concrete actions, with few abstractions. Why? The ancient Greeks certainly had no problem with abstraction‚Äîthis was the society that produced Plato and Aristotle, after all. Havelock believes that the stories evolved away from abstraction over time. When they were passed along from generation to generation, the more memorable concrete details survived and the abstractions evaporated.\nBlue highlight | Page: 111\rBrown Eyes, Blue Eyes\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rNovices perceive concrete details as concrete details. Experts perceive concrete details as symbols of patterns and insights that they have learned through years of experience.\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rTo build such machinery, the firm needed two sets of skills: engineers who could create brilliant designs, and skilled manufacturing people who could transform those designs into complex physical machines. If the firm was to succeed, these two sets of people had to be able to communicate smoothly.\nYellow highlight | Page: 115\rIt‚Äôs easy to lose awareness that we‚Äôre talking like an expert. We start to suffer from the Curse of Knowledge, like the tappers in the ‚Äútappers and listeners‚Äù game. It can feel unnatural to speak concretely about subject matter we‚Äôve known intimately for years. But if we‚Äôre willing to make the effort we‚Äôll see the rewards: Our audience will understand what we‚Äôre saying and remember it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 115\rthe moral of the story is to find a ‚Äúuniversal language,‚Äù one that everyone speaks fluently. Inevitably, that universal language will be concrete.\nYellow highlight | Page: 116\rWhen Boeing prepared to launch the design of the 727 passenger plane in the 1960s, its managers set a goal that was deliberately concrete: The 727 must seat 131 passengers,8 fly nonstop from Miami to New York City, and land on Runway 4-22 at La Guardia. (The 4-22 runway was chosen for its length‚Äîless than a mile, which was much too short for any of the existing passenger jets.)\nYellow highlight | Page: 116\rWith a goal this concrete, Boeing effectively coordinated the actions\nYellow highlight | Page: 116\rof thousands of experts in various aspects of engineering or manufacturing. Imagine how much harder it would have been to build a 727 whose goal was to be ‚Äúthe best passenger plane in the world.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 119\rWrite down as many things that are white in color as you can think of. STOP. Reset your timer for fifteen seconds. Turn the page for the instructions for Step 2. STEP 2 INSTRUCTIONS: Write down as many white things in your refrigerator as you can think of.\nBlue highlight | Page: 120\rWhy does this happen? Because concreteness is a way of mobilizing and focusing your brain. For another example of this phenomenon, consider these two statements: (1) Think of five silly things that people have done in the world in the past ten years. (2) Think about five silly things your child has done in the past ten years.\nYellow highlight | Page: 123\rConcreteness creates a shared ‚Äúturf‚Äù on which people can collaborate. Everybody in the room feels comfortable that they‚Äôre tackling the same challenge. Even experts‚Äîeven the Kleiner Perkins venture capitalists, the rock stars of the technology world‚Äîbenefit from concrete talk that puts them on common ground.\nYellow highlight | Page: 129\rTo be simple‚Äîto find our core message‚Äîis quite difficult. (It‚Äôs certainly worth the effort, but let‚Äôs not kid ourselves that it‚Äôs easy.) Crafting our ideas in an unexpected way takes a fair amount of effort and applied creativity. But being concrete isn‚Äôt hard, and it doesn‚Äôt require a lot of effort. The barrier is simply forgetfulness‚Äîwe forget that we‚Äôre slipping into abstractspeak. We forget that other people don‚Äôt know what we know. We‚Äôre the engineers who keep flipping back to our drawings, not noticing that the assemblers just want us to follow them down to the factory floor.\nYellow highlight | Page: 138\rA person‚Äôs knowledge of details is often a good proxy for her expertise.\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rWe‚Äôve seen that we can make our ideas more credible, on their own merits, by using compelling details or by using statistics.\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rIt‚Äôs the Sinatra Test: If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. Safexpress, a family-owned business\nYellow highlight | Page: 153\rFor an example that unites all three of the ‚Äúinternal credibility‚Äù sources‚Äîdetails, statistics, and the Sinatra Test‚Äîwe can turn to Bill McDonough, an\nYellow highlight | Page: 155\rSo far we‚Äôve talked about creating credibility by drawing on external sources‚Äîauthorities and antiauthorities. And we‚Äôve talked about creating credibility by drawing on sources inside the message itself‚Äîby using details and statistics and examples that pass the Sinatra Test. But there‚Äôs one remaining source of credibility that we haven‚Äôt discussed. And it may be the most powerful source of all.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rThe ads were a refreshing departure from the standard advertiser tool kit that attempts to paint powerful but irrelevant emotions on consumer goods‚Äîfor instance, associating a mother‚Äôs love of her children with a particular brand of fabric softener.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rWendy‚Äôs did something more admirable: It highlighted a genuine advantage of its product and presented it in an enjoyable way.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rthe commercials developed a brand-new source of credibility: the audience. Wendy‚Äôs outsourced its credibility to its customers.\nYellow highlight | Page: 157\rThe spots implicitly challenged customers to verify Wendy‚Äôs claims: See for yourself‚Äîlook at our burgers versus McDonald‚Äôs burgers. You‚Äôll notice the size difference!\nYellow highlight | Page: 157\rTestable credentials can provide an enormous credibility boost, since they essentially allow your audience members to ‚Äútry before they buy.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 157\rbait-and-switch version of ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the Beef?‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 158\rTestable credentials are useful in many domains. For example, take the question ‚ÄúAre you better off now than you were four years ago?‚Äù Ronald Reagan famously posed this question to the audience during his 1980 presidential debate with Jimmy Carter.\nYellow highlight | Page: 158\rThe mission of the PCA is to emphasize that youth sports should not be about winning at all costs; it should be about learning life lessons.\nYellow highlight | Page: 159\rObserving their own behavior, the coaches learn the lesson‚Äîhow they found it easier to criticize than to support, to think of ten clever insults rather than a single consolation.\nYellow highlight | Page: 159\rThompson found a way to transform his point into a testable credential, something the coaches could experience for themselves.\nYellow highlight | Page: 160\revent, to judge the event‚Äôs probability by its availability in our memory.\nYellow highlight | Page: 160\rWe intuitively think that events are more likely when they are easier to remember. But often the things we remember are not an accurate summary of the world.\nYellow highlight | Page: 163\rBut what‚Äôs more likely to stick with someone: hearing about someone who fooled someone else, or being fooled yourself?\nYellow highlight | Page: 163\rIt‚Äôs not always obvious which wellspring of credibility we should draw from. What Marshall showed so brilliantly was perseverance‚Äîknowing when it was time to draw on a different well. In this chapter we‚Äôve seen that the most obvious sources of credibility‚Äîexternal validation and statistics‚Äîaren‚Äôt always the best. A few vivid\nYellow highlight | Page: 164\rdetails might be more persuasive than a barrage of statistics. An antiauthority might work better than an authority. A single story that passes the Sinatra Test might overcome a mountain of skepticism. It‚Äôs inspirational to know that a medical genius like Marshall had to climb over the same hurdles with his idea as we‚Äôll have to climb with ours‚Äîand to see that he eventually prevailed, to the benefit of us all.\nYellow highlight | Page: 167\rThe researchers theorized that thinking about statistics shifts people into a more analytical frame of mind. When people think analytically, they‚Äôre less likely to think emotionally. And the researchers believed it was people‚Äôs emotional response to Rokia‚Äôs plight that led them to act.\nYellow highlight | Page: 167\rWhen people were primed to feel before they read about Rokia, they gave $2.34, about the same as before. But when they were primed to calculate before they read about Rokia, they gave $1.26.\nYellow highlight | Page: 167\rThese results are shocking. The mere act of calculation reduced people‚Äôs charity. Once we put on our analytical hat, we react to emotional appeals differently. We hinder our ability to feel.\nYellow highlight | Page: 168\rIN THE LAST chapter, we discussed how to convince people that our ideas are credible, how to make them believe. Belief counts for a lot, but belief isn‚Äôt enough. For people to take action, they have to care.\nYellow highlight | Page: 169\rRather, the goal of making messages ‚Äúemotional‚Äù is to make people care. Feelings inspire people to act.\nYellow highlight | Page: 171\rThe Truth campaign isn‚Äôt about rational decision-making; it‚Äôs about rebellion. And it made a lot of teens care enough to do something. In this case, that something was nothing.\nYellow highlight | Page: 171\rIn fact, many ideas use a sort of piggybacking strategy, associating themselves with emotions5 that already exist.\nYellow highlight | Page: 172\rThe movie questions the existence of absolute truth‚Äîor, at least, our ability to uncover it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 172\rFrom Einstein‚Äôs view, things don‚Äôt look unpredictable; they look surprisingly orderly.\nYellow highlight | Page: 176\rThey called it Honoring the Game. People care about sports, they care about the Game.

Principles‚Äîequality, individualism, ideals about government, human rights, and the like‚Äîmay matter to us even when they violate our immediate self-interest.\nYellow highlight | Page: 189\rAnd perhaps the most important part of the story is this: ‚ÄúGroup interest‚Äù is often a better predictor of political opinions than self-interest. Kinder says that in forming opinions people seem to ask not ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in it for me?‚Äù but, rather, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in it for my group?‚Äù Our group affiliation may be based on race, class, religion, gender, region, political party, industry, or countless other dimensions of difference.\nYellow highlight | Page: 190\rThis model is the standard view of decision-making in economics classes: People are self-interested and rational.\nYellow highlight | Page: 190\rThe second model is quite different. It assumes that people make decisions based on identity. They ask themselves three questions: Who am I? What kind of situation is this?\nYellow highlight | Page: 190\rAnd what do people like me do in this kind of situation?\nYellow highlight | Page: 190\rThere are no calculations, only norms and principles. Which sofa would someone like me‚Äîa Southeastern accountant‚Äîbe more likely to buy? Which political candidate should a Hollywood Buddhist get behind?\nYellow highlight | Page: 191\rBut from the perspective of the identity model of decision-making, turning down the popper makes perfect sense. The thought process would be more like this: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a firefighter. You‚Äôre offering me a popcorn popper to get me to view a film on safety. But firefighters aren‚Äôt the kind of people who need little gifts to motivate us to learn about safety. We risk our lives, going into burning buildings to save people. Shame on you for implying that I need a popcorn popper!‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 191\rto unite these two decision models. What if the marketer had offered to donate fifty dollars to a school‚Äôs fire-safety program in exchange for the firemen‚Äôs viewing the film?

Think about the students who missed both a fantastic lecture and a great film because they couldn‚Äôt decide which one was better, or how hard it was for Jeff Hawkins, the leader of the Palm Pilot development group, to get his team to focus on a few issues rather than on many.

Getting a message across has two stages: the Answer stage and the Telling Others stage. In the Answer stage, you use your expertise to arrive at the idea that you want to share.

Business managers may deliberate for months to arrive at the Answer.\nYellow highlight | Page: 245\rHere‚Äôs the rub: The same factors that worked to your advantage in the Answer stage will backfire on you during the Telling Others stage. To get the Answer, you need expertise, but you can‚Äôt dissociate expertise from the Curse of Knowledge. You know things that others don‚Äôt know, and you can‚Äôt remember what it was like not to know those things. So when you get around to sharing the Answer, you‚Äôll tend to communicate as if your audience were you.\nYellow highlight | Page: 245\rThere is a curious disconnect between the amount of time we invest in training people how to arrive at the Answer and the amount of time we invest in training them how to Tell Others.\nNote:made a good point\nYellow highlight | Page: 245\rCollege professors take dozens of courses in their areas of expertise but none on how to teach.\nYellow highlight | Page: 245\rA lot of engineers would scoff at a training program about Telling Others.\nYellow highlight | Page: 245\rclicked through a PowerPoint\nYellow highlight | Page: 245\rIf they‚Äôre good speakers, they may even have created an enhanced sense,\nYellow highlight | Page: 246\rThey‚Äôve shared data, but they haven‚Äôt created ideas that are useful and lasting.

Pause for two full seconds before you speak.\nPink highlight | Location: 222\rCHARISMATIC BEHAVIOR CAN be broken down into three core elements: presence, power, and warmth.\nYellow highlight | Location: 225\rIn order to be charismatic, we need to choose mental states that make our body language, words, and behaviors flow together and express the three core elements of charisma.\nYellow highlight | Location: 285\rWhen you‚Äôre fully present, it shows in your body language in a highly charisma-enhancing way.\nYellow highlight | Location: 286\rBeing charismatic does not depend on how much time you have but on how fully present you are in each interaction.\nYellow highlight | Location: 288\rThe people you‚Äôre with feel that they have your full attention and that they are the most important thing in the world to you at that moment.\nYellow highlight | Location: 298\r‚ÄúIn most moments we have a continuous internal commentary on what is happening and what we should do next. We might greet a friend with a hug, but the warmth of our greeting becomes blurred by our computations about how long to embrace or what we‚Äôre going to say when we‚Äôre done. We rush through the motions, not fully present.‚Äù Being present enables you to fully notice and drink in the good moments.\nYellow highlight | Location: 307\rWe look for clues of power in someone‚Äôs appearance, in others‚Äô reaction to this person, and, most of all, in the person‚Äôs body language.\nYellow highlight | Location: 308\rothers. Warmth tells us whether or not people will want to use whatever power they have in our favor.\nYellow highlight | Location: 310\rWarmth is assessed almost entirely through body language and behavior; it‚Äôs evaluated more directly than power.\nYellow highlight | Location: 322\rwarmth. The combination of power and warmth would have been very rare and very, very precious:\nPink highlight | Location: 327\rFrom lab experiments to neuroimaging, research has consistently shown that they are the two dimensions we evaluate first and foremost in assessing other people.3 Both power and warmth are necessary conditions for charisma.\nYellow highlight | Location: 341\rThough this may sound incredible‚Äîhow could words carry so little weight compared to the body language of the person delivering them?‚Äîit actually makes sense. In the scope of human evolution, language is a relatively recent invention.\nYellow highlight | Location: 344\rThis is why nonverbal communication has a far greater impact.\nYellow highlight | Location: 359\rThe second consequence is that our body language expresses our mental state whether we like it or not.\nYellow highlight | Location: 364\r(remember, people can read your face in as little as seventeen milliseconds).\nYellow highlight | Location: 375\rThus, the first step in learning charisma‚Äîand what the first part of this book is all about‚Äîis developing the various mental states that produce charismatic body language and behaviors.\nYellow highlight | Location: 389\rIndividuals with strong internal skills are aware of what exactly is happening inside them and know how to handle\nYellow highlight | Location: 399\r‚ÄúTo know others is knowledge. To know oneself is wisdom.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 400\rKnowing your internal world starts with one key insight upon which all charisma is built: your mind can‚Äôt tell fact from fiction. This is the one dimension of your internal world that can help you get into the right charismatic mental state at will, and almost instantly.\nYellow highlight | Location: 423\rThe placebo effect is the basis for many of the best charisma-enhancing techniques,\nYellow highlight | Location: 436\rWhen you exhibit presence, those around you feel listened to, respected, and valued.\nYellow highlight | Location: 438\rexhibit presence, power, and warmth‚Äîyou must display charismatic body language.\nYellow highlight | Location: 440\rby creating a charismatic internal state your body language will authentically display charisma.\nYellow highlight | Location: 441\rcritical.

How well you breathe affects how much oxygen gets to your brain, and therefore how well you perform mentally.\nYellow highlight | Location: 524\rFor many of us, a state of doubt or uncertainty is an uncomfortable place to be.\nYellow highlight | Location: 526\rOur inability to tolerate uncertainty carries multiple costs.\nYellow highlight | Location: 529\rAnxiety is a serious drawback to charisma. First, it impacts our internal state: quite obviously, it‚Äôs hard to be fully present while you‚Äôre feeling anxious. Anxiety can also lower our confidence. Anxiety, low presence, and low confidence can show up directly in our body language, as well as reduce our ability to emanate warmth.\nYellow highlight | Location: 531\rYet if there‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs certain, it‚Äôs that uncertainty isn‚Äôt going away.\nYellow highlight | Location: 533\rThose who are better at handling it will gain a distinctive advantage over others.\nYellow highlight | Location: 537\rBut how many of us have felt our minds going over the different outcomes again and again, rehashing the various plans we‚Äôve made, replaying possible scenarios, mentally rehearsing the upcoming conversations not just once or twice but ad nauseam?\nYellow highlight | Location: 547\rThe reason Tom couldn‚Äôt let go is that our minds are fundamentally uncomfortable with uncertainty.\nYellow highlight | Location: 548\rThe minute our brain registers ambiguity, it flashes an error signal. Uncertainty registers as a tension: something that must be corrected before we can feel comfortable again.\nPink highlight | Location: 549\rOur natural discomfort with uncertainty is yet another legacy of our survival instincts. We tend to be more comfortable with what is familiar, which obviously hasn‚Äôt killed us yet, than with what is unknown or uncertain, which could turn out to be dangerous.\nYellow highlight | Location: 552\rthe ability to be comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity turns out to be one of the strongest predictors of success in business.\nYellow highlight | Location: 558\rThe single most effective technique I‚Äôve found to alleviate the discomfort of uncertainty is the responsibility transfer.\nYellow highlight | Location: 577\rIf you did feel something happen, fantastic: you‚Äôve just performed a responsibility transfer.\nYellow highlight | Location: 580\rThe reason this technique works is that when presented with a scenario, our brain‚Äôs first reaction is to consider it as possible.\nYellow highlight | Location: 585\rmay last only a brief moment, it‚Äôs enough to produce an emotional and physical reassurance,\nYellow highlight | Location: 591\rHowever, the responsibility transfer works without trying to negate uncertainty. Instead, it helps you to be less affected by it, drawing you out of the negative mental and physical states that often accompany a position of not knowing.\nYellow highlight | Location: 593\rBy presenting your mind with the possibility that responsibility has been transferred, you‚Äôre putting to good use the wonderful placebo effect‚Äîthe brain‚Äôs inability to distinguish between imagination and reality.\nYellow highlight | Location: 603\rPersonally, I‚Äôve chosen to believe in a benevolent Universe, which has a grand master plan for me (and for everything else).\nYellow highlight | Location: 605\rperform a quick visualization to transfer responsibility. It‚Äôs amazing to feel the instant sense of relief and the warmth, calm, and serenity rising. I feel my whole body relax, and it‚Äôs as if my whole being starts to glow.\nYellow highlight | Location: 607\rDissatisfaction Caused by Comparison\nYellow highlight | Location: 611\rHuman beings are by nature driven to compare.\nYellow highlight | Location: 614\rThe very act of comparing and evaluating hinders our ability to be fully present.\nYellow highlight | Location: 616\rAnd a negative evaluation can easily put us in a negative mental state, such as dissatisfaction, envy, or resentment.\nYellow highlight | Location: 623\rFew things impact people‚Äôs performance more than how they feel about themselves.\nYellow highlight | Location: 624\rAthletes will tell you that a bad mental state will affect their performance no matter how well prepared they are physically. Psychological negativity can have real physical consequences.\nPink highlight | Location: 625\rWhen our internal voice starts criticizing us, lashing out, it can feel like we‚Äôre under attack. Because our brain doesn‚Äôt distinguish between imagination and reality, these internal attacks are perceived by our mind just as a real, physical attack would be, and they can generate an automatic physical reaction known as the threat response or fight-or-flight response.\nPink highlight | Location: 628\rThe effects of this activation are well-known. Just as a zebra reacts to the stress of being chased by a lion, the human body shoots adrenaline and cortisol (stress hormones) through its veins, and directs all its resources toward crucial functions: elevated heart and breathing rates, muscle reaction, vision acuity, and so forth. The body is no longer concerned with living ten more years, but with surviving ten more minutes. It shuts down nonurgent functions such as muscle repair, digestion, and the immune system,\nYellow highlight | Location: 633\rIn other words, because it‚Äôs not critical to survival, intelligent thinking gets shut down.\nPink highlight | Location: 633\rDavid Rock, founder of the NeuroLeadership Institute, explains that ‚Äúthe threat response impairs analytic thinking, creative insight, and problem solving.‚Äù7 This kind of negativity doesn‚Äôt just affect our actual performance, it also affects how others perceive us.\nYellow highlight | Location: 639\rNo matter how brief that negative expression, the person facing you is going to spot it. And all they know is that while you were looking at them and listening to them, a negative expression crossed your face. Naturally they‚Äôll assume that expression was a reaction to them‚Äîwhat they said or did, or what you thought about them. This is how internal negativity affects your body language, and thus your charisma, in addition to your performance.\nYellow highlight | Location: 642\rSelf-criticism is one of the most common obstacles to great performance in any field.\nYellow highlight | Location: 646\r‚ÄúEighty percent of my day is spent fighting my inner critic.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 650\renough. In one of the manifestations of self-doubt, known as the impostor syndrome, competent people feel they don‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre doing and are just waiting for someone to expose them as a fraud.\nYellow highlight | Location: 654\rBut already, just knowing the universality of such feelings can help us neutralize their effect and reduce their power.\nYellow highlight | Location: 668\rThe difficult feelings we experience are a natural by-product of one of our most useful survival mechanisms.\nYellow highlight | Location: 669\rFeelings like fear or anxiety are designed to get you to do something. They‚Äôre uncomfortable because they‚Äôre ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù to be uncomfortable.\nYellow highlight | Location: 706\rFeeling internal discomfort and negativity is a natural part of life. Everyone experiences it.\nYellow highlight | Location: 713\rwe feel they ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt‚Äù be happening. So not only do we feel bad, we then also feel bad about feeling bad.\nYellow highlight | Location: 735\rThe brain equates social needs with survival; being hungry and being ostracized activate similar neural responses.1 Somewhere in the back of our minds is the fear of being so disapproved-of that we‚Äôd be excluded by those who matter to our survival.\nYellow highlight | Location: 740\rthat the tendency to feel bad about feeling bad is especially true for good people.\nYellow highlight | Location: 767\rwhatever I‚Äôve seen may well be the sign of how they‚Äôre feeling about themselves, an itchy wool suit, or something else entirely.\nYellow highlight | Location: 784\rreality. But sometimes our mind will present us with a seriously distorted view of reality. And the distortion often skews negative because the elements that our danger-focused brain deems important\nYellow highlight | Location: 785\rare usually the most negative ones. This tendency is called the negativity bias, and\nYellow highlight | Location: 798\rWhen your brain spins negative scenarios, remind yourself that you may not be getting an accurate perception of reality.\nYellow highlight | Location: 810\rfailure is seldom fatal, and just realizing that even the worst-case scenario is survivable can bolster your confidence.\nYellow highlight | Location: 830\rthoughts. We want to avoid falling into the trap of arguing with them or trying to suppress them.\nYellow highlight | Location: 837\rBecause trying to suppress a self-critical thought only makes it more central to your thinking, it‚Äôs a far better strategy to simply aim to neutralize it.\nYellow highlight | Location: 850\rOnce the fight-or-flight response is aroused, it‚Äôs hard to quiet down.\nYellow highlight | Location: 852\rIf you aimed to simply suppress the anger, you would pay a high price.\nYellow highlight | Location: 854\rBut what if you happened to learn that this apparently reckless driver was actually a distraught mother whose baby was choking in the backseat, and she was desperately trying to pull over into the breakdown lane while reaching back to save her baby‚Äôs life?\nYellow highlight | Location: 857\rDeciding to change your belief about what happened (technically called cognitive reappraisal) effectively decreases the brain‚Äôs stress levels.\nYellow highlight | Location: 859\rThe researchers concluded that deciding to change beliefs was a far more effective and healthier solution than attempting to repress or ignore emotions.4 In most situations, we don‚Äôt know for certain what motivates a person‚Äôs actions, so we might as well choose the explanation that is most helpful to us and create a version of events that gets us into the specific mental state we need for charisma.\nYellow highlight | Location: 863\rfirst, choosing to rewrite your perception of reality is actually the rational and smart thing to do.\nYellow highlight | Location: 864\rIt can help you get back into the right mental state to emanate charismatic body language and can improve\nYellow highlight | Location: 875\rWhat if this unfortunate, unpleasant experience is absolutely perfect just as it is‚Äîthe insomnia, the nausea, the fact that this is happening the very night before a high-profile assignment?\nYellow highlight | Location: 876\rIn what way can this turn out to be absolutely perfect for me?\nYellow highlight | Location: 890\r‚ÄúI decide to interpret everything favorably toward myself.\nYellow highlight | Location: 890\rIt‚Äôs not just that I‚Äôm optimistic, I‚Äôm actually conveniently deluded.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 891\rOnce again, we can thank the brain‚Äôs tendency to accept imagination as reality.\nYellow highlight | Location: 894\rrather than trying to suppress or ignore your internal difficulties, consider a few alternate versions of reality.

We must learn to think in moments, to spot the occasions that are worthy of investment.\nYellow highlight | Location: 254\rThis ‚Äúmoment-spotting‚Äù habit can be unnatural. In organizations, for instance, we are consumed with goals. Time is meaningful only insofar as it clarifies or measures our goals. The goal is the thing.\nYellow highlight | Location: 255\rBut for an individual human being, moments are the thing. Moments are what we remember and what we cherish. Certainly we might celebrate achieving a goal, such as completing a marathon or landing a significant client‚Äîbut the achievement is embedded in a moment.\nYellow highlight | Location: 261\rWe‚Äôll explore three situations that deserve punctuation: transitions, milestones, and pits.\nBlue highlight | Location: 265\rcrisp up an otherwise gradual evolution\nYellow highlight | Location: 269\rThat logic shows why the first day of work is an experience worth investing in.

If you‚Äôre struggling to make a transition, create a defining moment that draws a dividing line between Old You and New You.\nYellow highlight | Location: 435\rThe little girl asked, ‚ÄúCan we come back tomorrow?‚Äù Dietz began to weep.

Their attention is naturally drawn to the customers who had the worst experiences. But in indulging that instinct, they miss an enormous opportunity. To be clear,\nYellow highlight | Location: 705\rHow do you build peaks? You create a positive moment with elements of elevation, insight, pride, and/or connection.\nYellow highlight | Location: 707\rTo elevate a moment, do three things: First, boost sensory appeal. Second, raise the stakes. Third, break the script.\nYellow highlight | Location: 741\rWhy? It‚Äôs no one‚Äôs job, and it‚Äôs a hassle, and there‚Äôs always something happening that seems more urgent. This same dynamic is what makes it so hard to create peaks in our personal lives as well.\nYellow highlight | Location: 749\rWe‚Äôre not trying to pop your balloon. Rather, we want to build your determination: It‚Äôs going to be way harder than you think to create peaks. But once you‚Äôve done it, you‚Äôre going to consider every ounce of effort worth it.

He knows professors are approaching curriculum design the wrong way, and he has a solution for them (backward-integrated design). If he pitched the virtues of the solution, that would make him, in essence, a salesman for backward-integrated design.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,261\rBut how do audiences respond to sales pitches? With skepticism. We quibble and challenge and question.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,262\rIf Palmer wants to persuade the professors, he needs them to trip over the truth.

He knew that many people become paralyzed by the fear of failure. They‚Äôre constantly afraid of what others will think if they don‚Äôt do a great job and, as a result, take no risks. My father wanted us to try everything and feel free to push the envelope. His attitude taught me to define failure as not trying something I want to do instead of not achieving the right outcome.‚Äù His question, ‚ÄúWhat did you guys fail at this week?‚Äù was a push to stretch. It was an attempt to normalize failure, to make it part of a casual dinner conversation. Because when you seek out situations where you might fail, failure loses some of its menace. You‚Äôve been inoculated against it.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,531\rThe promise of stretching is not success, it‚Äôs learning. It‚Äôs self-insight. It‚Äôs the promise of gleaning the answers to some of the most important and vexing questions of our lives: What do we want? What can we do? Who can we be? What can we endure?\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,539\rMoments of insight deliver realizations and transformations.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,556\rThe promise of stretching is not success, it‚Äôs learning.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,567\rGreat experiences are mostly forgettable and occasionally remarkable.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,699\rKeith Risinger, who works in leadership development at Eli Lilly, has made recognition a hallmark of his management style.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,721\rAbout a month later, Risinger kicked off a sales meeting with the story of Hughes‚Äôs progress with Dr.¬†Singh, highlighting the value of asking more questions and listening to the answers.

What‚Äôs important is authenticity: being personal not programmatic. And frequency: closer to weekly than yearly. And of course what‚Äôs most important is the message: ‚ÄúI saw what you did and I appreciate it.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,839\rThe common goal to ‚Äúget in shape‚Äù is ambiguous and un-motivating. Pursuing it puts you on a path with no clear destination and no intermediate moments to celebrate.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,843\rThree months ago, I couldn‚Äôt run 100 yards without heaving, and now I‚Äôm the kind of person who can finish a race!\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,848\rHe worried about how much of his life he was losing to the escapist pleasures of gaming.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,888\rBy using Kamb‚Äôs level-up strategy, we multiply the number of motivating milestones we encounter en route to a goal. That‚Äôs a forward-looking strategy:\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,890\rWe‚Äôre anticipating moments of pride ahead. But the opposite is also possible: to surface those milestones you‚Äôve already met but might not have noticed.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,921\rA numerical goal plus supporting plans. Notice what that combination leaves us with: A destination that is not inherently motivating and that lacks meaningful milestones along the way. As a result, achieving the ‚Äú20 by 2020‚Äù goal\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,925\rWe should be careful that we don‚Äôt let this corporate style of goal-setting infiltrate our personal lives, where we‚Äôre in full control. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to lose 10 pounds in 2 months,‚Äù for instance, is a classic corporate goal: arbitrary, numerical, and lacking intermediate milestones.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,928\rBy now, you know what to do: Restore the milestones. Level up: Go one week straight without using the elevator. Pick out 2 microbrews to enjoy on Saturday after a full week without booze. If I jog continuously for three songs on my playlist, that entitles me to download three new ones. And so on.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,944\rThe same logic applies to milestones involving less tangible goals, such as building leadership\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,944\rskills. In most organizations, the only clear ‚Äúlevels‚Äù en route to leadership positions are promotions. But what if it takes five years for an employee to earn a promotion, or what if she is not interested in or suited for a promotion? How do you create the intermediate milestones that could provide moments of pride?\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,958\rHitting a milestone sparks pride. It should also spark a celebration‚Äîa moment of elevation. (Don‚Äôt forget that milestones, along with pits and transitions, are three natural defining moments that deserve extra attention.) Milestones deserve peaks.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,001\r‚ÄúFrom my experience, the most common trait you will consistently observe in accomplished people is an obsession with completion.6 Once a project falls into their horizon, they crave almost compulsively, to finish it.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,004\rWhat milestones do is compel us to make that push, because (a) they‚Äôre within our grasp, and (b) we‚Äôve chosen them precisely because they‚Äôre worth reaching for.

As the psychologist S. J.

The civil rights demonstrator and the bomb-disposal operator must be able to control their fears to be successful.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,114\rBut courage isn‚Äôt just suppressed fear. It‚Äôs also the knowledge of how to act in the moment.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,117\rHis workshops weren‚Äôt just about toughening up emotionally. They were about mental rehearsals.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,117\rParticipants had to anticipate how they would react to certain situations. In a sense, they were preloading a response so that, in the moment, they could act quickly without deliberation.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,119\rThe psychologist Peter Gollwitzer has studied the way this preloading affects our behavior. His research shows that when people make advance mental commitments‚Äîif X happens, then I will do Y‚Äîthey are substantially more likely to act in support of their goals than people who lack those mental plans.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,123\rGollwitzer calls these plans ‚Äúimplementation intentions,‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,124\rand often the trigger for the plan is as simple as a time and place: When I leave work today, I‚Äôm going to drive straight to the gym.

Some people like to live in a planned, orderly way and others prefer flexibility and spontaneity.35 Planners (or ‚ÄúJudgers‚Äù in Myers-Briggs terms) like to focus on a plan and stick with it, while perceivers are prone to focus on what‚Äôs happening around them and adapt to it. Perceivers work from the outside in; they see things happening and work backward to understand the cause and how to respond; they also see many possibilities that they compare and choose from‚Äîoften so many that they are confused by them. In contrast, planners work from the inside out, first figuring out what they want to achieve and then how things should unfold. Planners and perceivers have trouble appreciating each other. Perceivers see new things and change direction often. This is discomforting to planners, who weigh precedent much more heavily in their decision making, and assume if it was done in a certain way before, it should be done in the same way again. Similarly, planners can discomfort perceivers by being seemingly rigid and slow to adapt.\nYellow highlight | Page: 228\rCreators generate new ideas and original concepts.

I‚Äôve found that shapers tend to share attributes such as intense curiosity and a compulsive need to make sense of things, independent thinking that verges on rebelliousness, a need to dream big and unconventionally, a practicality and determination to push through all obstacles to achieve their goals, and a knowledge of their own and others‚Äô weaknesses and strengths so they can orchestrate teams to achieve them. Perhaps even more importantly, they can hold conflicting thoughts simultaneously and look at them from different angles. They typically love to knock things around with other really smart people and can easily navigate back and forth between the big picture and the granular details, counting both as equally important.\nYellow highlight | Page: 231\rNature made everything and everyone for a purpose.

Negotiation will often present you with a similar situation.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,671\rThe siren song of ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs all agree and put an end to this‚Äù becomes persuasive. You may end up with a deal you should have rejected.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,676\rHaving a bottom line makes it easier to resist pressure and temptations of the moment.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,684\rBut the protection afforded by adopting a bottom line involves high costs. It limits your ability to benefit from what you learn during negotiation. By definition, a bottom line is a position that is not to be changed.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,686\rA bottom line also inhibits imagination. It reduces the incentive to invent a tailor-made solution that would reconcile differing interests in a way more advantageous for both you and them.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,691\rthis. A bottom line‚Äîby its very nature rigid‚Äîis almost certain to be too rigid.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,699\rIs there an alternative to the bottom line? Is there a measure for agreements that will protect you against both accepting an agreement you should reject and rejecting an agreement you should accept? There is.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,708\rThe reason you negotiate is to produce something better than the results you can obtain without negotiating.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,709\rWhat is your BATNA‚Äîyour Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement? That is the standard against which any proposed agreement should be measured.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,714\rIf you have not thought carefully about what you will do if you fail to reach an agreement, you are negotiating with your eyes closed.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,718\rOne frequent mistake is psychologically to see your alternatives in the aggregate. You may be telling yourself that if you do not reach agreement on a salary for this job, you could always go to California, or go south, or go back to school, or write, or work on a farm, or live in Paris, or do something else. In your mind you are likely to find the sum of these alternatives more attractive than working for a specific salary in a particular job.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,722\ryou fail to reach agreement, you will have to choose just one.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,723\rIn most circumstances, however, the greater danger is that you are too committed to reaching agreement. Not having developed any alternative to a negotiated solution, you are unduly pessimistic about what would happen if negotiations broke off.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,727\rYou may think to yourself, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs negotiate first and see what happens. If things don‚Äôt work out, then I‚Äôll figure out what to do.‚Äù But having at least a tentative answer to the question is absolutely essential if you are to conduct your negotiations wisely.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,732\rit is useful to identify one far from perfect agreement that is better than your BATNA.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,741\rIn fact, the relative negotiating power of two parties depends primarily upon how attractive to each is the option of not reaching agreement.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,745\rThe tourist may be wealthy and ‚Äúpowerful,‚Äù but in this negotiation he will be weak indeed unless he knows approximately how much it would cost and how difficult it would be to find a comparable pot elsewhere.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,749\rThink for a moment about how you would feel walking into a job interview with no other job offers‚Äîonly some uncertain leads.

Having an attractive BATNA, the small town had more ability to affect the outcome of the negotiation than did one of the world‚Äôs largest corporations.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,763\rVigorous exploration of what you will do if you do not reach agreement can greatly strengthen your hand. Attractive alternatives are not just sitting there waiting for you; you usually have to develop them.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,764\r(1) inventing a list of actions you might conceivably take if no agreement is reached; (2) improving some of the more promising ideas and converting them into practical alternatives; and (3) selecting, tentatively, the one alternative that seems best.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,770\rThe second stage is to improve the best of your ideas and turn the most promising into real alternatives.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,777\rHaving gone through this effort, you now have a BATNA.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,777\rJudge every offer against it. The better your BATNA, the greater your ability to improve the terms of any negotiated agreement.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,779\rIt is easier to break off negotiations if you know where you‚Äôre going. The\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,780\rgreater your willingness to break off negotiations, the more forcefully you can present your interests and the basis on which you believe an agreement should be reached.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,783\rIf they think you lack a good alternative when in fact you have one, then you should almost certainly let them know.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,789\rreached.

If they criticize your proposal, you may be tempted to defend it and dig yourself in.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,827\rIf they attack you, you may be tempted to defend yourself and counterattack. In short, if they push you hard, you will tend to push back.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,834\rBreak the vicious cycle by refusing to react. Instead of pushing back, sidestep their attack and deflect it against the problem.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,836\rRather than resisting their force, channel it into exploring interests, inventing options for mutual gain, and searching for independent standards.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,847\rask them how they think it addresses the problem at hand.

When the other side attacks you personally ‚Äî as frequently happens ‚Äî resist the temptation to defend yourself or to attack them. Instead, sit back and allow them to let off steam.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,883\rListen to them, show you understand what they are saying,\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,887\rAsk questions and pause. Those engaged in negotiation jujitsu use two key tools. The first is to use questions instead of statements.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,888\rStatements generate resistance, whereas questions generate answers.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,893\rSilence is one of your best weapons. Use it. If they have made an unreasonable proposal or an attack you regard as unjustified, the best thing to do may be to sit there and not say a word.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,894\rIf you have asked an honest question to which they have provided an insufficient answer, just wait. People tend to feel uncomfortable with silence, particularly if they have doubts about the merits of something they have said.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,899\rSilence often creates the impression of a stalemate that the other side will feel impelled to break by answering your question or coming up with a new suggestion.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,900\rWhen you ask questions, pause. Don‚Äôt take them off the hook by going right on with another question or some comment of your own. Some of the most effective negotiating you will ever do is when you are not talking.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,967\rthat a camel is a horse designed by a committee.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,973\rNote that in most situations you do not have to get anyone‚Äôs consent to start using the one-text procedure.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,974\rSimply prepare a draft and ask for criticism.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,992\rThe essence of principled negotiation lies in remaining open to persuasion by objective facts and principles.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,000\rMaking yourself open to correction and persuasion is a pillar in the strategy of principled negotiation. You can convince the other side to be open to the principles and objective standards you suggest only if you show yourself open to the ones they suggest.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,002\r‚ÄúWe appreciate what you‚Äôve done for us‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,007\r‚ÄúWe have nothing against you personally.

At the same time, he lets Mrs.¬†Jones know he is open to persuasion along the lines of this principle. She is thus left with little choice but to reason with him in pursuit of her interests.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,018\rHis ends, he claims, are a fair balance between rent paid and time spent.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,020\r‚ÄúWe would like to settle this on the basis of independent standards, not of who can do what to whom‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,035\rBut instead of reacting, Turnbull keeps his temper and brings the negotiation back to the merits. This is a good example of negotiation jujitsu. He deflects Mrs.¬†Jones‚Äôs attack by taking responsibility for her mistaken perceptions, and he tries to persuade her of his sincere interest in principle.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,037\rHe does not hide either his selfish interests or his leverage over her; on the contrary, he makes both explicit. Once they are acknowledged, he can distinguish them from the merits and they can cease being an issue.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,047\rhowever, by expressing his gratitude once more and then defining the question of trust as irrelevant. Turnbull at once reaffirms his appreciation of Mrs.¬†Jones while he remains firm on the principle. In doing so, he avoids connecting the two thoughts with ‚Äúbut,‚Äù implicitly using ‚Äúand‚Äù instead. ‚ÄúBut,‚Äù sometimes called the ‚Äúgreat eraser,‚Äù has a tendency to negate the first thing you say by implying that only one of two statements can be true, making it either/or. ‚ÄúAnd‚Äù underscores the more complex reality that both thoughts can be true at the same time.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,065\rAnalysis. Statements of fact can feel lecturing or threatening. Whenever you can, ask a question instead.\nNote:important\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,069\rPhrasing each piece of information as a question allows Mrs.¬†Jones to participate, listen to the information, evaluate it, and either accept or correct it.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,070\rTurnbull communicates the same information to her but in a less provocative manner. He reduces the heat still further by attributing a particularly pointed question to his absent roommate.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,076\rA principled negotiator neither accepts nor rejects the other side‚Äôs positions.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,076\rTo keep the dialogue focused on the merits, Turnbull questions Mrs.¬†Jones about the reasons for her position. He does not ask whether there were any reasons. He assumes there are good reasons. This flattering assumption leads the other side to search for reasons even if there are none, thus keeping the negotiation on the basis of principle.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,086\rAnalysis. Principled negotiation requires good communication. Before responding to Mrs.¬†Jones‚Äôs arguments, Turnbull restates to her in positive terms what he has heard to make sure he has indeed understood her.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,087\rOnce she feels understood, she can relax and discuss the problem constructively.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,088\rShe can‚Äôt dismiss his arguments on the grounds that they do not take into account what she knows. She is more likely to listen now and be more receptive. In trying to sum up her point of view, Turnbull establishes a cooperative game in which both are making sure he understands the facts.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,093\rAnalysis. A good negotiator rarely makes an important decision on the spot. The psychological pressure to be nice and to give in is too great. A little time and distance help disentangle the people from the problem.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,097\rHe shows not only decisiveness but also control over the course of the negotiation.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,103\rTurnbull: Let me show you where I have trouble following some of your reasons for the extra $268 a month.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,108\rAnalysis. In principled negotiation you present your reasons first before offering a proposal. If principles come afterward, they appear not as the objective criteria that any proposal should satisfy but as mere justifications for an arbitrary position.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,110\rFor Turnbull to explain his reasons first shows his openness to persuasion and his awareness of the need to convince Mrs.¬†Jones. If he announced his proposal first, Mrs.¬†Jones probably would not bother to listen to the reasons that followed. Her mind would be elsewhere, considering what objections and counterproposals she could make.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,114\rIn preparing for your negotiation, it helps to think about what standards would be useful, who might be able to provide them, and how to frame your questions to elicit the most relevant information.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,116\r‚ÄúOne fair solution might be ‚Ä¶‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,120\rAnalysis. Turnbull presents a proposal not as his, but as a fair option that deserves their joint consideration.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,120\rHe does not claim it is the only fair solution, but one fair solution. He is specific without digging himself into a position and inviting rejection.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,127\rTurnbull is trying to make it easy for Mrs.¬†Jones to say yes to his proposal. So he starts by making it clear that all it takes for the problem to go away is Mrs.¬†Jones‚Äôs agreement.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,130\rwithout upsetting the negotiations? He bases the alternative on objective principle by attributing it to a legal authority‚Äîthe hearing examiner.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,131\rHe distances himself personally from the suggestion.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,144\rIncorporating her interests into the agreement not only gives her more of a stake in it but also allows Mrs.¬†Jones to save face.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,148\rPaul and I do appreciate, Mrs.¬†Jones, all that you‚Äôve done for us, and I‚Äôm pleased that we‚Äôve settled this last problem fairly and amicably.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,194\rDon‚Äôt attack people personally for using a tactic you consider illegitimate. If they get defensive it may be more difficult for them to give up the tactic, and they may be left with a residue of anger that will fester and interfere with other issues.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,198\rDon‚Äôt be diverted from the negotiation by the urge to teach them a lesson.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,202\rInvent options for mutual gain.

In contrast, looking behind positions for interests, inventing options for mutual gain, and finding and using objective criteria take hard work and, when the other side seems recalcitrant, emotional restraint and maturity.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,461\rHow complex are the issues? The more complex the subject matter, the more unwise it is to engage in positional bargaining. Complexity calls for careful analysis of interests that are shared or that can be creatively dovetailed, and then for brainstorming.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,463\rHow important is it to maintain a good working relationship? If the other side is a valued customer or client, maintaining your ongoing relationship may be more important to you than the outcome of any one deal. This does not mean you should be less persistent in pursuing your interests, but it does suggest avoiding tactics such as threats or ultimatums that involve a high\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,482\rBargaining over positions does the least harm if it comes after you have identified each other‚Äôs interests, invented options for mutual gain, and discussed relevant standards of fairness.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,486\rYet using external standards improves on haggling in three ways: An outcome informed even by conflicting standards of fairness and community practice is likely to be wiser than an arbitrary result.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,506\rUsing external standards often helps narrow the range of disagreement and may help expand the area of potential agreement.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,527\rMany negotiators are overly optimistic in assuming that they are more clever than their counterparts.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,548\rThe human propensity for defensive and reactive behavior is one reason so many negotiations fail when agreement would otherwise make sense.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,551\rThe more seriously you disagree with someone, the more important it is that you be able to deal well with that disagreement.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,561\rRather, substantive issues need to be disentangled from relationship and process issues. The content of a possible agreement needs to be separated from questions of how you talk about it and how you deal with the other side. Each set of issues needs to be negotiated on its own merits. The following list illustrates the distinction: Substantive Issues Terms Conditions Prices Dates Numbers Liabilities Relationship Issues Balance of emotion and reason Ease of communication Degree of trust and reliability Attitude of acceptance (or rejection) Relative emphasis on persuasion (or coercion) Degree of mutual understanding People often assume that there is a trade-off between pursuing a good substantive outcome and pursuing a good relationship. We disagree. A good working relationship tends to make it easier to get good substantive outcomes (for both sides). Good substantive outcomes tend to make a good relationship even better.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,575\rOur point is that you should not give in for the purpose of trying to improve a relationship.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,587\rOur behavior should be designed to model and encourage the behavior we would prefer and to avoid any reward for the behavior we dislike, both without compromising our substantive interests.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,600\rIt is the perception that is skewed, not the response to that perception.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,601\rOn the other hand, if you inquire empathetically, taking their feelings seriously and trying to trace their reasoning to its roots, it is sometimes possible to effect change.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,603\rWorking with them, you may discover a logical leap, a factual misperception, or a traumatic association from an earlier time that, once brought to light, can be examined and modified by the people themselves.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,604\rIn essence, you are looking for the psychological interests behind their position, to help them find a way to meet more of their interests more effectively.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,656\rA key point, worth repeating, is that negotiating does not require compromising your principles.

When people blame their partner‚Äôs personality for the problem, they feel anger and disgust toward them.\nYellow highlight | Page: 154\rRelationship expert Daniel Wile says that choosing a partner is choosing a set of problems. There are no problem-free candidates. The trick is to acknowledge each other‚Äôs limitations, and build from there.\nYellow highlight | Page: 155\rIt was a problem of communication, not a problem of personality or character. Yet in the fixed mindset, the blame came fast and furious.\nYellow highlight | Page: 155\rIn the end, this marriage was saved‚Äîonly because the couple learned to respond to each other not with angry labels, but with helpful actions. One day, when Karen was swamped with work, Ted came home to a messy house. He was angry and wanted to scold her, but, drawing on what he‚Äôd learned from Beck, he instead said to himself, ‚ÄúWhat is the mature thing to do?‚Äù He answered his own question by starting to clean things up. He was offering Karen support rather than judgment.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rAaron Beck tells couples in counseling never to think these fixed-mindset thoughts: My partner is incapable of change. Nothing can improve our relationship. These ideas, he says, are almost always wrong.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rBill was a permanently bad and untrustworthy husband or a man who needed a lot of help.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rYet Hillary could not have forgiven a person she saw as a liar and a cheat.

The rest is not really relevant since I wasn‚Äôt seeking validation, but I‚Äôll tell you anyway.\nYellow highlight | Page: 158\rWhat allowed me to take that first step, to choose growth and risk rejection? In the fixed mindset, I had needed my blame and bitterness. It made me feel more righteous, powerful, and whole than thinking I was at fault. The growth mindset allowed me to give up the blame and move on. The growth mindset gave me a mother.\nYellow highlight | Page: 158\rIn a relationship, the growth mindset lets you rise above blame, understand the problem, and try to fix it‚Äîtogether.\nYellow highlight | Page: 158\rIn the fixed mindset, where you‚Äôve got to keep proving your competence, it‚Äôs easy to get into a competition with your partner.

They go out and meet new people, and, after their nerves settle down, their relationships proceed normally. The shyness doesn‚Äôt tyrannize them.\nYellow highlight | Page: 167\rIn our study, the students with the growth mindset were not as prone to see the bullying as a reflection of who they were. Instead, they saw it as a psychological problem of the bullies, a way for the bullies to gain status or charge their self-esteem: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd think that the reason he is bothering me is probably that he has problems at home or at school with his grades.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 168\rwould want to forgive them eventually‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy number one goal would be to help them become better people.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 168\r‚ÄúPeople do have the potential to change.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 169\rBullies judge.

First, while enforcing consistent discipline, he doesn‚Äôt judge the bully as a person. No criticism is directed at traits. Instead, he makes them feel liked and welcome at school every day.\nYellow highlight | Page: 170\rdirection. But again, he does not praise the person; he praises their effort.\nYellow highlight | Page: 170\rnotice that you have been staying out of fights. That tells me you are working on getting along with people.‚Äù You can see that Davis is leading students directly to the growth mindset. He is helping them see their actions as part of an effort to improve. Even if the change was not intentional on the part of the bullies, they may now try to make it so.\nYellow highlight | Page: 171\rbut hopeful of forgiving, learning, and moving on? Think of the worst rejection you ever had. Get in touch with all the feelings, and see if you can view it from a growth mindset. What did you learn from it? Did it teach you something about what you want and don‚Äôt want in your life? Did it teach you some positive things that were useful in later relationships? Can you forgive that person and wish them well? Can you let go of the bitterness?\nYellow highlight | Page: 172\rProblems can be a vehicle for developing greater understanding and intimacy. Allow your partner to air his or her differences, listen carefully, and discuss them in a patient and caring manner.\nYellow highlight | Page: 172\rAre you a blamer like me? It‚Äôs not good for a relationship to pin everything on your partner. Create your own Maurice and blame him instead. Better yet, work toward curing yourself of the need to blame. Move beyond thinking about fault and blame all the time. Think of me trying to do that too.\nYellow highlight | Page: 172\rAre you shy? Then you really need the growth mindset. Even if it doesn‚Äôt cure your shyness, it will help keep it from messing up your social interactions. Next time you‚Äôre venturing into a social situation, think about these things: how social skills are things you can improve and how social interactions are for learning and enjoyment, not judgment. Keep practicing this.\nYellow highlight | Page: 173\r‚ÄúI would do anything, give anything, to make my children successful.‚Äù Yet many of the things they do boomerang.

The fact is, you already know how to find yourself; you have just gotten distracted and disoriented.\nYellow highlight | Page: 4\r‚ÄúThis above all: to thine own self be true.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 10\rThere is nothing more important to true growth than realizing that you are not the voice of the mind‚Äîyou are the one who hears it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 10\rThe truth is that most of life will unfold in accordance with forces far outside your control, regardless of what your mind says about it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 10\rThey are simply making you feel better or worse about what is going on now, what has gone on in the past, or what might go on in the future.\nYellow highlight | Page: 10\rthere is no reason to constantly attempt to figure everything out. Eventually you will see that the real cause of problems is not life itself. It‚Äôs the commotion the mind makes about life that really causes problems.\nYellow highlight | Page: 12\rWhat you end up experiencing is really a personal presentation of the world according to you, rather than the stark, unfiltered experience of what is really out there.\nYellow highlight | Page: 12\rYour consciousness is actually experiencing your mental model of reality, not reality itself.\nYellow highlight | Page: 12\rIf you can‚Äôt get the world the way you like it, you internally verbalize it, judge it, complain about it, and then decide what to do about\nYellow highlight | Page: 14\rIf you decide not to narrate and, instead, just consciously observe the world, you will feel more open and exposed.\nYellow highlight | Page: 14\rYou will come to see that the mind talks all the time because you gave it a job to do. You use it as a protection mechanism, a form of defense.\nYellow highlight | Page: 14\rTrue personal growth is about transcending the part of you that is not okay and needs protection.\nYellow highlight | Page: 14\rThe one inside who is aware that you are always talking to yourself about yourself is always silent. It is a doorway to the depths of your being.\nYellow highlight | Page: 14\rIf used properly, the same mental voice that has been a source of worry, distraction, and general neurosis can become the launching ground for true spiritual awakening. Come to know the one who watches the voice, and you will come to know one of the great mysteries of creation.\nYellow highlight | Page: 15\rYour inner growth is completely dependent upon the realization that the only way to find peace and contentment is to stop thinking about yourself.\nYellow highlight | Page: 15\rgrow when you finally realize that the ‚ÄúI‚Äù who is always talking inside will never be content.\nYellow highlight | Page: 15\rThe bottom line is, you‚Äôll never be free of problems until you are free from the part within that has so many problems.\nYellow highlight | Page: 15\rWhen a problem is disturbing you, don‚Äôt ask, ‚ÄúWhat should I do about it?‚Äù Ask, ‚ÄúWhat part of me is being disturbed by this?‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 16\ryou think the solution to your inner problems is in the world outside. You think that if you change things outside, you‚Äôll be okay. But nobody has ever truly become okay by changing things outside. There‚Äôs always the next problem.\nYellow highlight | Page: 16\rThe first problem you have to deal with is your own reaction.\nYellow highlight | Page: 16\rYou will not be able to solve anything outside until you own how the situation affects you inside.\nYellow highlight | Page: 16\ryou will realize that the real problem is that there is something inside of you that can have a problem with almost anything.\nYellow highlight | Page: 16\ra change from ‚Äúouter solution consciousness‚Äù to ‚Äúinner solution consciousness.‚Äù You have to break the habit of thinking that the solution to your problems is to rearrange things outside.\nYellow highlight | Page: 22\ryourself. You will eventually catch on that you have to distance yourself from your psyche.\nYellow highlight | Page: 22\rThere is nothing you can‚Äôt do. Your will is supreme over all of this.\nYellow highlight | Page: 22\rYou do this as though your life depended on it, because it does. As it is right now, your life is not your own; it belongs to your inner roommate, the psyche. You have to take it back. Stand firm in the seat of the witness and release the hold that the habitual mind has on you. This is your life‚Äîreclaim it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 30\r1As explicated by the Buddha in the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra (trans. Kosho Yamamoto 1973). 2Atman: Hinduism - The innermost essence of each individual (Merriam-Webster 2003).\nNote:book\nYellow highlight | Page: 35\rAs scary as it sounds, that is your predicament in life.\nYellow highlight | Page: 35\rUnless you‚Äôre fully seated in witness consciousness, you‚Äôre not back there being aware that you‚Äôre the one watching all this. That is what it means to be lost.\nYellow highlight | Page: 45\rYou could actually be in the habit of experiencing an uptight, closing sensation whenever somebody walks up to you. You can train yourself to do the opposite. You can train yourself to open every time you see a person.\nYellow highlight | Page: 46\rWhat you‚Äôll find is that the only thing you really want from life is to feel enthusiasm, joy, and love. If you can feel that all the time, then who cares what happens outside?\nYellow highlight | Page: 46\rif you can always feel excited about the experience of the moment, then it doesn‚Äôt make any difference what the experience is.\nYellow highlight | Page: 46\rSo you learn to stay open no matter what happens. If you do, you get for free what everybody else is struggling for: love, enthusiasm, excitement, and energy.\nYellow highlight | Page: 46\rDo not let anything that happens in life be important enough that you‚Äôre willing to close your heart over\nYellow highlight | Page: 46\rsay, ‚ÄúNo.¬†I‚Äôm not going to close. I‚Äôm going to relax. I‚Äôm going to let this situation take place and be there with\nYellow highlight | Page: 46\rNo matter what anyone does, no matter what situation takes place, you won‚Äôt even feel the tendency to close. You will just embrace life with all your heart and soul.\nYellow highlight | Page: 48\rAs long as you are defining what you like and what you don‚Äôt like, you will open and close. You are actually defining your limits. You are allowing your mind to create triggers that open and close you.\nYellow highlight | Page: 48\rLet go of that. Dare to be different. Enjoy all of life.\nYellow highlight | Page: 52\rLife must now compete with this blocked event for your attention, and the impression does not just sit in there quietly.\nYellow highlight | Page: 53\rIn the yogic tradition, that unfinished energy pattern is called a Samskara. This is a Sanskrit word meaning ‚Äúimpression,‚Äù and in the yogic teachings it is considered one of the most important influences affecting your life. A Samskara is a blockage, an impression from the past. It‚Äôs an unfinished energy pattern that ends up running your life.\nYellow highlight | Page: 57\rThe alternative is to be willing to let it go when it gets stimulated. It only hurts for a minute and then it‚Äôs over.\nYellow highlight | Page: 60\rBecause most of us don‚Äôt have to worry about food, clothing, or shelter, we have the luxury of worrying about a spot on our pants, or laughing too loud, or saying something wrong. Because we‚Äôve developed this hypersensitive psyche, we constantly use our energies to close around it and protect ourselves. But this process only hides the problems; it doesn‚Äôt fix them. You‚Äôre locking your illness inside yourself,\nYellow highlight | Page: 61\rif you protect yourself, you will never be free. It‚Äôs that simple.\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rOnce you close, you have to make sure that what you protected doesn‚Äôt get disturbed. You then carry this task for the rest of your life.\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rday. How often do you find yourself trying to protect and defend that weak part of you? You feel like the world wants to get right at it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rThe reward for not protecting your psyche is liberation. You are free to walk through this world without a problem\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rYou are just having fun experiencing whatever happens next.\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rdisturbed. You no longer have to listen to ‚ÄúWhat will they think of me?‚Äù or, ‚ÄúOh God, I wish I hadn‚Äôt said that. It sounded so stupid.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rSpiritual growth is about the point at which you start to feel your energy change.\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rFor instance, somebody says something, and you start to feel the energy get a little strange inside. You will actually start to feel a tightening. That is your cue that it‚Äôs time to grow. It‚Äôs not time to defend yourself, because you don‚Äôt want the part of you that you would be defending.\nYellow highlight | Page: 64\rThis technique of freeing yourself is done with the understanding that thoughts and emotions are just objects of consciousness.\nYellow highlight | Page: 64\rconsciousness. If you want to be free, then every time you feel any change in the energy flow, relax behind it. Don‚Äôt fight with it, don‚Äôt try to change it, and don‚Äôt judge it. Don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúOh, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm still feeling this. I promised myself I wouldn‚Äôt think about that car anymore.‚Äù Don‚Äôt do that; you‚Äôll just end up going with the guilt thoughts instead of the car thoughts. You have to let them all go.\nYellow highlight | Page: 65\rOnly you can take inner freedom away from yourself, or give it to yourself. Nobody else can.\nYellow highlight | Page: 71\rIf you have a lot of fear, you won‚Äôt like change. You‚Äôll try to create a world around you that is predictable, controllable, and definable. You‚Äôll try to create a world that doesn‚Äôt stimulate your fears. Fear doesn‚Äôt want to feel itself; it‚Äôs actually afraid of itself.\nYellow highlight | Page: 71\rYou can do one of two things with fear: you can recognize that you have it and work to release it, or you can keep it and try to hide from\nYellow highlight | Page: 72\rYour definitions of desirable and undesirable, as well as good and bad, all come about because you have defined how things need to be in order for you to be okay.\nYellow highlight | Page: 72\rAs you grow spiritually, you will realize that your attempts to protect yourself from your problems actually create more problems.\nYellow highlight | Page: 73\rWhen your heart is weak it becomes susceptible to lower vibrations, and one of the lowest of all vibrations is fear. Fear is the cause of every problem. It‚Äôs the root of all prejudices and the negative emotions of anger, jealousy, and possessiveness.\nYellow highlight | Page: 73\rYou‚Äôd be willing to face everything and everyone because you wouldn‚Äôt have fear inside of you that could cause you disturbance.\nYellow highlight | Page: 73\rThe purpose of spiritual evolution is to remove the blockages that cause your fear.\nYellow highlight | Page: 74\rEveryone is saying, ‚ÄúI will do every single thing I can to keep my stuff. If you say anything that disturbs me, I will defend myself. I‚Äôll yell at you and make you take it back. If you cause any disturbance inside of me, I will make you so sorry.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 74\ragain. First you defend yourself, and then you protect yourself. You do whatever you can to keep from feeling disturbance.\nYellow highlight | Page: 74\rYou only have to be willing to open your heart in the face of anything and everything, and permit the purification process to take place.\nYellow highlight | Page: 76\rYour consciousness leaves the centered position of witnessing the many energies around you, and you get sucked into focusing on just one of them.\nYellow highlight | Page: 76\rThings you liked, now look dark and depressing. But nothing has really changed. It‚Äôs just that you‚Äôre looking at life from that seat of disturbance.\nYellow highlight | Page: 80\rSo don‚Äôt fall. Let go. No matter what it is, let it go. The bigger it is, the higher the reward of letting go and the worse the fall if you don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs pretty black-and-white. You either let go or you don‚Äôt. There really isn‚Äôt anything in between. So let all of your blockages and disturbances become the fuel for the journey. That which is holding you down can become a powerful force\nYellow highlight | Page: 81\rReal transformation begins when you embrace your problems as agents for growth. In order to understand how this process works, let‚Äôs examine the following situation.\nYellow highlight | Page: 88\rThis is what you begin to experience if you hang out with the Self instead of hanging out with inner disturbances.\nYellow highlight | Page: 88\rAwareness is simply aware while everything in the universe parades before it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 89\rWhen Buddha said that all of life is suffering, this is what he was referring to. People do not understand how much they are suffering because they have never experienced what it is like to not suffer.\nYellow highlight | Page: 90\rYou are either trying to stop suffering, controlling your environment to avoid suffering, or worrying about suffering in the future. This state of affairs is so prevalent that you don‚Äôt see it, just as a fish doesn‚Äôt see the water.\nYellow highlight | Page: 91\rInner sensitivity is a symptom of non-well-being. It‚Äôs the same as when the body sends pain or displays other symptoms when it‚Äôs not well.\nYellow highlight | Page: 91\rYour psyche is communicating through its universal language: fear. Self-consciousness, jealousy, insecurity, anxiety‚Äîthey are all fear.\nYellow highlight | Page: 92\rWhat you‚Äôll see is that your mind is always telling you that you have to change something outside in order to solve your inner problems. But if you are wise, you won‚Äôt play this game. You‚Äôll realize that the advice your mind is giving you is psychologically damaged advice. Your mind‚Äôs thoughts are disturbed by its fears.\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\rThe fact is, however, external changes are not going to solve your problem because they don‚Äôt address the root of your problem. The root problem is that you don‚Äôt feel whole and complete within yourself.\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\rYou began with a problem inside yourself, and you tried to solve it by getting involved with somebody else.\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\rImagine what fun life would be if you didn‚Äôt have those neurotic, personal thoughts going on within you. You could enjoy things, and you could actually get to know people instead of needing them.\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\rYou could just live and experience your life, instead of trying to use life to fix what‚Äôs wrong inside of you. You are capable of achieving that state. It‚Äôs never too late.\nYellow highlight | Page: 95\ryour mind starts telling you what you have to do to make everything inside okay, don‚Äôt buy into what it‚Äôs\nYellow highlight | Page: 95\rThe truth is, everything will be okay as soon as you are okay with everything. And that‚Äôs the only time everything will be okay.\nYellow highlight | Page: 96\rThere are billions of people on this planet, and one of them didn‚Äôt say hello to you. Are you saying that you can‚Äôt handle that? Is that reasonable?\nYellow highlight | Page: 96\rBegin this journey to freedom by regularly reminding yourself to watch the psyche.\nYellow highlight | Page: 97\rEvery time you get into your car, as you‚Äôre settling into the seat, just stop. Take a moment to remember that you‚Äôre spinning on a planet in the middle of empty space. Then remind yourself that you‚Äôre not going to get involved in your own melodrama.\nYellow highlight | Page: 97\rPersistently centered consciousness is the seat of Self.\nYellow highlight | Page: 98\rby untethering yourself from the bondage of your psyche,\nYellow highlight | Page: 98\rThis freedom is so great it has been given a special name‚Äîliberation.\nYellow highlight | Page: 101\rheart. What is that feeling? Why is that happening? People don‚Äôt normally ask why; they just try to keep it from happening.\nYellow highlight | Page: 101\rYou must go deeper than that and look at the dynamics of the layers that have been created. At the core there is the pain. Then, in order to avoid the pain, you try to stay busy with friends and hide\nYellow highlight | Page: 102\rsky. You are sitting on a planet spinning around in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Though you can only see a few thousand stars, there are hundreds of billions of stars in our Milky Way Galaxy alone. In fact, it is estimated that there are over a trillion stars in the Spiral Galaxy.\nYellow highlight | Page: 102\rFrom that perspective, do you really care what people think about your clothes or your car? Do you really need to feel embarrassed if you forget someone‚Äôs name?\nYellow highlight | Page: 102\rTo spend your life avoiding pain means it‚Äôs always right behind you. At any point you could slip and say the wrong thing. At any point anything can happen. So you end up devoting your life to the avoidance of pain.\nYellow highlight | Page: 103\rIn essence, you can simply live your life and experience what it‚Äôs like to be on a planet that is spinning around in the middle of nowhere, until you die.\nYellow highlight | Page: 103\rIf you want to be free, simply view inner pain as a temporary shift in your energy flow.\nYellow highlight | Page: 103\rYou cannot spend your life avoiding things that are not actually happening, or everything will become negative.\nYellow highlight | Page: 103\rProbably more than there are stars in the sky. If you want to grow and be free to explore life, you cannot spend your life avoiding the myriad things that might hurt your heart or mind.\nYellow highlight | Page: 103\rYou must look inside yourself and determine that from now on pain is not a problem. It is just a thing in the universe.\nYellow highlight | Page: 103\rwith it, you will devote your life to avoiding it. If you feel insecurity, it‚Äôs just a feeling. You can handle a feeling. If you feel embarrassed, it‚Äôs just a feeling. It‚Äôs just a part of creation. If you feel jealousy and your heart burns, just look at it objectively, like you would a mild bruise. It‚Äôs a thing in the universe that is passing through your system. Laugh at it, have fun with it, but don‚Äôt be afraid of\nYellow highlight | Page: 103\rit. It cannot touch you unless you touch it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 104\rWise beings do not want to remain a slave to the fear of pain. They permit the world to be what it is instead of being afraid of it. They wholeheartedly participate in life, but not for the purpose of using life to avoid themselves.\nYellow highlight | Page: 104\rlet it pass through you like the wind.\nYellow highlight | Page: 105\rJust start seeing these inner experiences as energy passing through your heart and before the eye of your consciousness.\nYellow highlight | Page: 105\rrelax. Do the opposite of contracting and closing.\nYellow highlight | Page: 106\rIf you have any wisdom, you will leave it alone and not try to change your life to avoid it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 106\ryou. If you do not care, if you are no longer afraid of yourself, you are free.\nYellow highlight | Page: 106\rYou will feel everything at a deeper level. You will begin to have truly beautiful experiences rise up within you. Eventually you will understand that there is an ocean of love behind all of this fear and pain.\nYellow highlight | Page: 112\rImagine that you found yourself in the midst of an open field where the sun was always shining. It was a beautiful place of great light and great openness.\nNote:Great analogy\nYellow highlight | Page: 116\rIt‚Äôs not really difficult to get past the walls. Time and again, every day, the natural flow of life collides with our walls and tries to tear them down. But time and again, we defend them. You must realize that when you defend yourself, you are really defending your walls.\nYellow highlight | Page: 120\rSince the analytical mind cannot handle the infinite, you created an alternate reality of finite thoughts that can remain fixed within your mind.\nYellow highlight | Page: 120\rThis mental model has become your reality. You must now struggle day and night to make the world fit your model, and you label everything that doesn‚Äôt fit as wrong, bad, or unfair.\nYellow highlight | Page: 120\rYou get frustrated and angry over simple little things. This is the result of being unable to fit what‚Äôs actually happening into your model of reality.\nYellow highlight | Page: 120\rIn order to truly go beyond your model, you must first understand why you built it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 121\rIf you really want to see why you do things, then don‚Äôt do them and see what happens.\nNote:interesting\nYellow highlight | Page: 121\rThe moment somebody starts behaving in a way that is outside your expectations, your mind starts talking. It says, ‚ÄúWhat should I do about this? I can‚Äôt just ignore what he did. I could confront him directly or ask someone else to talk to him.‚Äù Your mind is telling you to fix it.\nNote:fix it in order to fit into your model\nYellow highlight | Page: 122\rThis zone is finite. All attempts to stay within it keep you finite. Going beyond always means letting go of the effort to keep things within your defined limits.\nYellow highlight | Page: 122\rIn other words, you can devote your whole life to the process of making sure everything fits within your limited model, or you can devote your life to freeing yourself from the limits of your model.\nYellow highlight | Page: 122\rBut in truth, the confines of your comfort zone create just such a cage. This inner cage doesn‚Äôt limit your body; it limits the expanse of your consciousness.\nYellow highlight | Page: 122\rIf you examine this, you will see that you‚Äôre willing to stay in this cage because you‚Äôre afraid.\nYellow highlight | Page: 122\rThey don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúGet me out of here! I‚Äôm locked in this tiny world in which everything has to be a certain way. I have to worry about what everybody‚Äôs doing, what I look like, and everything I‚Äôve ever said. I want out.‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 123\rYou see that you‚Äôre afraid to tell people what you really think. You see that you‚Äôre too self-conscious to freely express yourself.\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rSpirituality begins when you decide that you‚Äôll never stop trying. Spirituality is the commitment to go beyond,\nYellow highlight | Page: 126\rThe day unfolds and the mind doesn‚Äôt say anything. You simply interact with the day with a peaceful, fully inspired heart.\nYellow highlight | Page: 129\ron. The more consciousness narrows its focus onto this mental structure, the greater the tendency to utilize it to define the concept of self.\nYellow highlight | Page: 130\rWho are you that is lost and trying to build a concept of yourself in order to be found?\nNote:why design a concept of self?\nYellow highlight | Page: 130\rYou will never find yourself in what you have built to define yourself. You‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs doing the building.\nYellow highlight | Page: 130\rIn this panic, in this lost state, you learned to cling and hold onto the thoughts and emotions that were passing before you. You used them to build a personality, a persona, a self-concept that would allow you to define yourself.\nYellow highlight | Page: 131\rIf you get that model down absolutely right, and behave consistently every time, you have actually ‚Äúcreated‚Äù someone.\nYellow highlight | Page: 131\rIt got engrained in you at a very young age,\nYellow highlight | Page: 134\rthe events that happen in the moment belong to the moment. They don‚Äôt belong to you.\nYellow highlight | Page: 135\rWhen your mind is disturbed, don‚Äôt ask, ‚ÄúWhat do I do about this?‚Äù Instead ask, ‚ÄúWho am I that notices this?‚Äù\nYellow highlight | Page: 136\raware. If you pass through a period of darkness or depression, just ask, ‚ÄúWho is aware of the darkness?‚Äù That‚Äôs how you pass through the different stages of your inner growth. You just keep letting go, and remain aware that you are still there.\nYellow highlight | Page: 136\rWhen you‚Äôve let go of the dark psyche, and you‚Äôve let go of the light psyche, and you‚Äôre no longer clinging to anything, you will reach a point where it will all open up behind you.\nYellow highlight | Page: 136\rYou will then walk through every moment of your daily life with the flow of this inner force sustaining you,\nYellow highlight | Page: 136\rYou will still have thoughts, emotions, and a self-concept floating around in inner space, but they will be just one small part of what you experience. You will not identify with anything outside the sense of Self.\nYellow highlight | Page: 143\rEvents don‚Äôt determine whether or not you‚Äôre going to be happy. They‚Äôre just events. You determine whether or not you‚Äôre going to be happy. You can be happy just to be alive. You can be happy having all these things happen to you, and then be happy to die. If you can live this way, your heart will be so open and your Spirit will be so free, that you will soar up to the heavens.\nYellow highlight | Page: 143\rYou‚Äôre sitting on a planet spinning around in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Go ahead, take a look at reality. You‚Äôre floating in empty space in a universe that goes on forever. If you have to be here, at least be happy and enjoy the experience. You‚Äôre going to die anyway. Things are going to happen anyway. Why shouldn‚Äôt you be happy?\nYellow highlight | Page: 144\rEvery time a part of you begins to get unhappy, let it go. Work with\nYellow highlight | Page: 145\rThe technique of unconditional happiness is ideal because what you‚Äôre doing with the rest of your life is already defined‚Äîyou‚Äôre letting go of yourself so that you can remain happy. As far as\nYellow highlight | Page: 146\ryour spirituality goes, you‚Äôre going to grow very rapidly.\nYellow highlight | Page: 146\rThey‚Äôre also going to notice the purification of their mind because they are not getting involved in the mind‚Äôs melodrama.\nYellow highlight | Page: 148\rEverything I look at just creates waves of joy inside me.\nYellow highlight | Page: 148\rGod in the yogic tradition is Satchitananda‚ÄîEternal, Conscious Bliss. God is ecstasy.\nYellow highlight | Page: 149\rIf you‚Äôre neither pushing life away, nor pulling it toward you, then you are not creating any resistance. You are simply present. In this state, you are just witnessing and experiencing the events of life taking place.\nYellow highlight | Page: 150\ryour being. It is what makes your arms and legs move. They don‚Äôt just move randomly by themselves. They move the way they do because you assert will to make them do so. You use the same will to hold onto thoughts when you want to concentrate on them.\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rEventually you‚Äôll see that this resistance is a tremendous waste of energy. The fact is, you‚Äôre generally using your will to resist one of two things: that which has already happened or that which hasn‚Äôt happened yet.\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rIt is not life‚Äôs events that are causing problems or stress. It is your resistance to life‚Äôs events that is causing this experience.\nYellow highlight | Page: 152\rThis is because we don‚Äôt all have the same preconceived notions of how things should be or how much they should matter to us.\nYellow highlight | Page: 152\rIf you want to understand stress, begin by realizing that you carry around with you your own set of preconceived notions of how things should be. It is based upon these notions that you assert your will to resist what has already happened. Where did you get these preconceived notions?\nYellow highlight | Page: 153\rbegin dealing with each situation with acceptance.\nYellow highlight | Page: 153\rThis is because events are not problems; they‚Äôre just events. Your resistance to them is what causes the problem. But, again, don‚Äôt think that because you\nYellow highlight | Page: 153\rYou will be surprised to find that in most situations there‚Äôs nothing to deal with except for your own fears and desires. Fear and desire make everything seem so complicated.\nYellow highlight | Page: 153\rWhen the events of this world make it through you, you have reached a deep spiritual state. You can then be conscious in the presence of whatever takes place, without building up blocked energies. When you attain that state, everything becomes clear. In contrast, everybody else is attempting to deal with the world around them while struggling with their own reactions and personal preferences. When a person is dealing with their own fears, anxieties, and desires, how much energy is left for dealing with what‚Äôs actually happening?\nYellow highlight | Page: 154\rStop and think about what you‚Äôre capable of achieving. Up to now, your capacities have been constrained by constant inner struggles. Imagine what would happen if your awareness was free to focus only on the events actually taking place.
