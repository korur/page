Covid-19 pandemic caught us off-guard.\nGoing through this topic, I created an R Shiny app, which allows users to fill in a health/behaviour survey which is then converted into a location based risk score through a data analytics module. To achieve this the app:\n\ruses google firebase authentication\rasks users permission to track location via a javascript code\rcreates a risk score around users location\rallows users to store and review their previous data\r\rWhen users from a given location submit their health data, the app can assess the number of symptomatic vs healthy people and record the daily changes in the risk score around the location.\nYou can access the app here: cRew symptomTracker\nThe app will need location information and user provided health parameters as input to calculate real-time risks. You can still test the app without providing your location. If location is not provided the app will locate you automatically in a remote place. Guess where?\nThe green circles on the map denotes healthy and red circle denotes the people with flu like symptoms.\nThe risk score is a value from 0 to 25, the maximum score you can get without any disease symptoms is 4. Thus, a value higher than 4 signals a risk. If you have all of the three symptoms in the survey like coughing, high fever and breathing difficulties and going to work then the algorithm will assess your risk score as max at 25.\nTo create an health tracking app we need to store user submitted data.\rI used firebase R package from John Coene to set up google firebase authentication so that users can sign in the app via their gmail or twitter accounts. If you want to set up firebase authentication for your shiny app please visit the package website, it is very descriptive and easy to understand.\nFor data storage, I used google firebase realtime database. User specific variables created during the authentication process can be used to set up user specific folders in the firebase database. Thus, users can access and only access their own data.\nIf you want to know more about how this process you can look at the readme of the R package (cRew).\n\rUsing modules or packaging Shiny apps make them much more manageable when the complexity increases.\rIf you have not used modules or packaged your Shiny apps here are some links to get you started:\n\rModularizing Shiny code\n\rPackaging Shiny apps\n\r\rGoing through some example Shiny apps which utilized Golem and modules will be very helpful:\n\rYou can check Coronavirus Tracker from John Coene\ror if you want to start from something simpler this one and go through the code files in the R folder.\r\r\rFuture thoughts\rR Shiny framework is really versatile and allows you create beautiful apps with advanced features.\nInstead of location, the app can also be applied to track health status of employees in big organizations. The organization may provide access to employees and they will enter their data regulary, this might help to warn individuals working in same departments or floors if some employees started to show disease symptoms. This can help to warn individuals and prevent further spread.\nThe survey data also can be easily integrated into a statistical/analytics pipeline to assess the results in real-time.\nUntil next time!\nSerdar\n\r","date":1591142400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591210763,"objectID":"96f9b4602975575d23d1129845c8fc5c","permalink":"/r/health-tracking/","publishdate":"2020-06-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/r/health-tracking/","section":"post","summary":"It is all about being positive or negative.\nMay be this sentence is enough to summarise our experiences from the last couple of months.

S. Eliot\nI was reading lately lots of books on productivity and self-development and often I found pieces of advice that I want to re-read later. The highlighting option on kindle makes this very easy. By reading and highlighting consistently I accumulated a sizeable amount text which was a good representation of the books I read.\nSince I know the content very well. I want to apply text mining and sentiment analysis to this data so that I can compare the results to my real opinion about the books. And if they match I will be more convinced to apply it to my next business problem.\nIn part, this is also a self-exploration, since I could answer questions such as what kind of content I like more, what was their emotional charge?\nLet’s find the answers.\nTo be objective, I will create an independent character called “the bat”. His next mission is to hack my data and analyze it to gather insights for selling me more books. Unfortunately, reading is not his specialty.\nThe room was in a mess when he entered. As he plugged the USB drive on his laptop, he barely heard the radio which was still on. The reporter:\n\rFrom the moment we switch on the early morning our cell phones to deal with the flood of information in some form of a whatsapp or facebook message or a tweet until we fall asleep at night overwriting or reading a product review we leave bread crumbs to our personal flavors on internet.\n\r\rMany businesses use this unstructured data to drive their sales by better marketing through targeted product recommendations or to segregate their customers…\n\rHe squeezed his teeth when he saw the data of 21000 lines of text from 28 books. His first encounter was the book “Mindset” by Carol Dweck, where she introduces the concept of growth mindset. The idea behind is people who have the growth mindset believe their abilities can be improved by putting effort whereas the people with the fixed mindset believe that their abilities are fixed at birth. As a consequence, people who has the fixed mindset miss the opportunity to get better at many things even though they can. Simply, because they don’t believe in it in the first place.\nIf you are not familiar with the concept, here is a video of Carol Dweck explaining her research on growth mindset.\nLong lines of text made him tired, he didn’t realize how the time passed. Now, he was a man of growth. He decided to learn text mining.\nHe started to learn the R packages for text mining, he didn’t like the package name tidytext but he was slightly losing his prejudices. It was a long night. He fell asleep on his table as the sun slowly rose.\r…\nIt was lighting my back garden where I could glance from time to time to the trees painted by the snow overnight ⛄️. Without an idea about how things went on the another part of the town, I continued to read and highlight my kindle as I zip from a glass of red wine 🍷.\n…\nWe will know what happened to our hacker later. First, let’s go together through his notebook.\nThe hacker’s notes\nHe noted down each step of his text mining plan carefully. Let me help you go through them.\nThis is how the exported kindle highlights look like.Reading and parsing the text file\n# Use readLines function to parse the text file\rhighlights \u0026lt;- readLines(\u0026quot;posts_data/Kindle_highlights_Serdar.Rmd\u0026quot;, encoding = \u0026quot;UTF-8\u0026quot;)\r# Create a dataframe where each row is a line from the text\rdf \u0026lt;- data.frame(highlights)\r# Packages\rlibrary(tidyverse) # includes ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats\rlibrary(tidytext)\rlibrary(wordcloud2)\rEvery data science project requires some sort of data preparation. Stop words are generally the most common words in a language and are usually filtered out before processing of text data.\nLet’s look at the stop_words dataset from the tidytext package. Since it is a long list of words (\u0026gt;1K) I will print every fifth word as an example.\ndata(stop_words)\r# print every 50th word stop_words_small \u0026lt;- stop_words[seq(1, nrow(stop_words), 50),]\rstop_words_small %\u0026gt;% print(n=50)\r## # A tibble: 23 x 2\r## word lexicon ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 a SMART ## 2 at SMART ## 3 contain SMART ## 4 few SMART ## 5 hers SMART ## 6 last SMART ## 7 nine SMART ## 8 presumably SMART ## 9 some SMART ## 10 they\u0026#39;d SMART ## 11 very SMART ## 12 without SMART ## 13 what snowball\r## 14 they\u0026#39;ll snowball\r## 15 during snowball\r## 16 again onix ## 17 but onix ## 18 finds onix ## 19 if onix ## 20 much onix ## 21 parted onix ## 22 since onix ## 23 under onix\rEvery data science project requires some sort of data preparation. Stop words are generally the most common words in a language and are usually filtered out before processing of text data.\ne.g. they’ll in stop_words\nAnd how the word they’ll appears in the text:\nYellow highlight | Page: 200\rMemories are continually revised, along with the meaning we derive from them, so that in the future they’ll be of even more use.\nWe have to make stop_words and our data compatible, otherwise some words such as they’ll, don’t, can’t might appear in our results.\nWe can use str_replace_all() function from stringr package to find all the apostrophes and convert them into single quotes.\ndf$highlights \u0026lt;- str_replace_all(df$highlights, \u0026quot;’\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026#39;\u0026quot;)\rNow, the text is ready for the frequency analysis. Words in a text mining project are called tokens. We can split the text into single words by unnest_tokens() function from tidytext package, filter the stop_words and count.\ndf \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% unnest_tokens(word, highlights) %\u0026gt;%\ranti_join(stop_words) %\u0026gt;% filter(!word %in% c(\u0026quot;highlights\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;highlight\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;page\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;location\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;yellow\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pink\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;))\rHe also added here some additional words which frequently appear in kindle highlights output.\ndplyr() package functions are very useful for grouping and counting the words from the lists that are created.\ntop_kindle_highlights \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% group_by(word) %\u0026gt;% count() %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(n))\rHe noted down his first insight. 10 most frequent words from my kindle highlights.\ntop_kindle_highlights\r## # A tibble: 12,433 x 2\r## # Groups: word [12,433]\r## word n\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt;\r## 1 people 592\r## 2 story 340\r## 3 life 318\r## 4 time 309\r## 5 mind 213\r## 6 change 212\r## 7 feel 211\r## 8 world 171\r## 9 person 170\r## 10 habits 157\r## # ... with 12,423 more rows\rIf you don’t like to look at long list of words wordclouds are a good alternative. Wordcloud2 package gives additional customization options for your wordclouds, for example you can use any image as a markup.wordcloud2(top_kindle_highlights, figPath = bat, size = 1, backgroundColor = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;, color = color_vector(data$freq) )\rSome ideas started to get shaped in his mind. He thought who made those highlights is someone interested in storytelling, writing and good communication, good habits, and people. Someone who wants to influence his life in a positive way. He was becoming more and more interested in the books.\nHe wanted to dig deeper.\nBigram Analysis\nSingle words are a good starting point what the books were about. But they are limited without the context. Frequency analysis can also be performed to measure how often word pairs (bigrams) occur in the text. This allows us to capture finer details in the text.\nTo do this he combined the unnested single tokens which is isolated above back into a continuous text and then performed bigram analysis. You can use str_c() function from stringr package to concatenate the single words.\n# Recreate the df\rdf \u0026lt;- data.frame(highlights)\rdf$highlights \u0026lt;- str_replace_all(df$highlights, \u0026quot;’\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026#39;\u0026quot;)\rdf \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% unnest_tokens(word, highlights) %\u0026gt;% anti_join(stop_words) %\u0026gt;% filter(!word %in% c(\u0026quot;highlights\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;highlight\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;page\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;location\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;yellow\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pink\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;export\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;hidden\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;truncated\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;kindle\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;note\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;limits\u0026quot;))\rdf_com \u0026lt;- str_c(df$word, \u0026quot; \u0026quot;) df_com \u0026lt;- data.frame(df_com)\rLet’s split the text into bigrams and count the most common word pairs.\ndf_bigram \u0026lt;- df_com %\u0026gt;% unnest_tokens(bigram, df_com, token = \u0026quot;ngrams\u0026quot;, n = 3, n_min = 2)\rtop_bigrams \u0026lt;- df_bigram %\u0026gt;% group_by(bigram) %\u0026gt;% count() %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(n))%\u0026gt;% print(n=20)\r## # A tibble: 107,317 x 2\r## # Groups: bigram [107,317]\r## bigram n\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt;\r## 1 body language 30\r## 2 behavior change 23\r## 3 crucial conversations 19\r## 4 fixed mindset 19\r## 5 growth mindset 19\r## 6 subconscious mind 19\r## 7 told story 18\r## 8 type person 17\r## 9 object desire 16\r## 10 system 1 16\r## 11 pay attention 15\r## 12 bad habits 13\r## 13 law behavior 13\r## 14 law behavior change 13\r## 15 social media 13\r## 16 inciting incident 12\r## 17 people feel 12\r## 18 subject matter 12\r## 19 human nature 11\r## 20 objective criteria 11\r## # ... with 1.073e+05 more rows\r# And visualize them on a plot\rtop \u0026lt;- top_bigrams[1:25,]\rtop %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% mutate(bigram = fct_reorder(bigram, n)) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=bigram, y=n)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() +\rtheme_classic() + theme(legend.position = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;,\rtext = element_text(size=18))\rI see that one of the most frequent bigrams is behavioral change. We can use this information to make sense of what we have found previously. For example, one of the most frequent word was change. And we saw with bigram analysis that the word change was used mostly in a context of behavioral change. So bigrams are useful tools to get deeper insights about the text content.\nMy highlighted text data come from 28 different books, and by looking at the most frequent words and bigrams in the whole document we got an overview of them.\nTo see how the individual books differ we can repeat this procedure for each of them.\nBut how can we capture them individually?\nLet’s first look at the text once more.Before each book “Your Kindle Notes For:” appears.\nLet’s find out the line numbers for the beginning and the end of each book and use those indexes for fishing out each book.\nWe will reuse the data frame df we created above. str_which() function returns line index numbers which contain an given input pattern.\nIn the final step, a for loop to capture the text between two consecutive indexes will give us the book between them.\n# Since I modified df above. I will recreate it again.\rdf \u0026lt;- data.frame(highlights)\rdf$highlights \u0026lt;- str_replace_all(df$highlights, \u0026quot;’\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026#39;\u0026quot;)\r# Getting the index number for each book\rindexes \u0026lt;- str_which(df$highlights, pattern = fixed(\u0026quot;Your Kindle Notes For\u0026quot;))\rbook_names \u0026lt;- df$highlights[indexes + 1]\rindexes \u0026lt;- c(indexes,nrow(df))\r# Create an empty list books \u0026lt;- list()\r# Now the trick.

For example success and effective for positive, bad and hard for negative sentiment.Here is how R produced the above plot:\ndf \u0026lt;- data.frame(highlights)\rdf$highlights \u0026lt;- str_replace_all(df$highlights, \u0026quot;’\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026#39;\u0026quot;)\rdf \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% unnest_tokens(word, highlights) %\u0026gt;% anti_join(stop_words) %\u0026gt;% filter(!word %in% c(\u0026quot;highlights\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;highlight\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;page\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;location\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;yellow\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pink\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;export\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;hidden\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;truncated\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;kindle\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;note\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;limits\u0026quot;))\rbing_word_counts \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% inner_join(get_sentiments(\u0026quot;bing\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %\u0026gt;%\rungroup()\rbing_word_counts\r## # A tibble: 1,854 x 3\r## word sentiment n\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt;\r## 1 bad negative 93\r## 2 success positive 91\r## 3 hard negative 85\r## 4 love positive 69\r## 5 difficult negative 63\r## 6 negative negative 63\r## 7 easy positive 62\r## 8 fear negative 62\r## 9 wrong negative 62\r## 10 positive positive 58\r## # ... with 1,844 more rows\r# Top contributors to positive and negative sentiment\rbing \u0026lt;- bing_word_counts %\u0026gt;% group_by(sentiment) %\u0026gt;% top_n(10) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(word, n), n, fill=sentiment)) + geom_bar(alpha=0.8, stat=\u0026quot;identity\u0026quot;, show.legend = FALSE)+\rfacet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = \u0026quot;free_y\u0026quot;) +\rlabs(y= \u0026quot;Contribution to sentiment\u0026quot;, x = NULL) +\rcoord_flip()\rbing\rUsing nrc lexion\nI am more likely to highlight a text if it is positive rather than negative.

But here I got some data that I know the content and I applied text mining approaches and sentiment analysis.\nBoth the monograms or bigrams pointed to similar ideas what the books were about. And the sentiments made sense with the genres of the books in my kindle.\nLet’s come back to our hacker.\nAn unanticipated side effect of text mining changed him forever. Analyzing my books and gaining the insights made him more and more interested in reading. And he started to care about the world around him. The world was different.\nWhat I was trying to do for myself, he did for himself. He transformed into a better version of himself.\nThe world was brighter. ☀️\nThe radio disrupted the silence.\n\r“brrring…..brrring…..brrring…..”\n\rI woke up.\n…\nThank you for reading.

When we initiate multiple tasks they are performed one after the other, new task starts only after the previous one is completed.\nThis might become the bottleneck when you come across a computationally heavy process. Such as running monte carlo simulations or fitting multiple machine learning models.Typically, if I have a process which runs longer than 3 minutes, I consider using parallel processing.\nIt might sound complicated but parallel computing is simple. When you have a repetitive task which takes too much of your valuable time why not implement it and save time? Even if you have a single task, you can benefit from parallel processing by dividing the task into smaller pieces.\nTwo widely used packages for parallel processing are parallel and foreach.\nLet’s do some parallel processing..\n\rWhat is our goal?\rI recently analyzed data from horror movies released in the world between 2012 and 2017. What caught my attention was that movies are more likely to be released at the 13th of each month. You can visit my recent post if you want to know more about this data.\nLet’s get the data\rThere are 2782 movies released in one of the 30 days (categories). The resulting table below shows the days of the month and how many movies released at that day.\nlibrary(tidyverse) # ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, # purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats\rhorror_movies \u0026lt;- readr::read_csv(\u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-10-22/horror_movies.csv\u0026quot;)\rdim(horror_movies)\r## [1] 3328 12\rhorror_date \u0026lt;- horror_movies %\u0026gt;% separate(\rrelease_date, c(\u0026quot;day\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;month\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;year\u0026quot;),\rsep = \u0026quot;-\u0026quot;)\rhorror_date$day \u0026lt;- as.numeric(horror_date$day)\r# Remove rows without Date of the month\rhorror_date \u0026lt;- horror_date %\u0026gt;% filter(day \u0026lt; 32) # I am excluding Day 1 from the analysis (Most aggreements starts at 1st)\rhorror_date_table \u0026lt;- horror_date %\u0026gt;% filter(day \u0026gt; 1)\r# let\u0026#39;s check what is the most common day in the month for a horror movie release\rdata \u0026lt;- horror_date_table %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(day) %\u0026gt;% count() %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(n))\rdata %\u0026gt;% print(n=30)\r## # A tibble: 30 x 2\r## # Groups: day [30]\r## day n\r## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt;\r## 1 13 124\r## 2 18 119\r## 3 25 119\r## 4 21 110\r## 5 31 107\r## 6 28 102\r## 7 10 100\r## 8 20 100\r## 9 5 99\r## 10 7 98\r## 11 2 95\r## 12 29 94\r## 13 14 91\r## 14 12 90\r## 15 24 90\r## 16 8 88\r## 17 15 88\r## 18 17 88\r## 19 16 87\r## 20 3 86\r## 21 4 86\r## 22 6 86\r## 23 9 85\r## 24 22 85\r## 25 26 84\r## 26 11 83\r## 27 27 82\r## 28 19 77\r## 29 30 74\r## 30 23 65\rI will simulate 1 million multinomial trials of distributing 2782 movies to 30 days of the month. This type of distributions (k \u0026gt; 2) are called multinomial distributions.xx`\nI created a function to find p values for each day. But it takes sometime to run. I will try to improve the runtime by optimizing my code and using parallel processing.\nmultfun \u0026lt;- function(x){ a \u0026lt;- list()\ravc \u0026lt;- rmultinom(1000000, size=2782, prob=rep(1/30, 30)) # Create probability matrix\rfor (i in 1:30){ a[[i]] \u0026lt;- mean(avc[i,1:1000000] \u0026gt;=x) } # Find probabilities for each day\rifelse(do.call(sum,a)/30 \u0026lt;= 0.5, p_val \u0026lt;- 2 * do.call(sum,a)/30, p_val \u0026lt;- 2*(1 - do.call(sum,a)/30))\r}\rmultfun() uses rmultinom() function to produce a matrix of monte carlo simulations of 1.000.000 random multinomial distributions with 30 categories. Then calculates total probabilities of any given observation or rarer events at each day from this matrix.\nThis actually translates into the p value for a given (n) observation.\rFor example, when I run multfun(124), It will give me the p value for observing a day with at least 124 movie releases.\n# Run an example\rmultfun(124)\r## [1] 0.001844267\rTo calculate the p values for the top 5 days with highest number of movie releases, I can run multfun() multiple times for each value.\nExecute the multfun() function multiple times\rsystem.time({\rmultfun(124)\rmultfun(119)\rmultfun(110)\rmultfun(107)\rmultfun(102)\r})\r## user system elapsed ## 15.72 0.21 15.94\rFor few values it can be ok, but easier methods exist if you need to run your function repetitvely for a bigger number of inputs.\n\rUsing lapply() function\rInstead of running a function for different input values several times, you can use lapply() function.

In my computer, I have 6 cores and I will assign 5 cores as the multiple workers.\nParallel processing: parLapply\rparLapply is the easiest way to parallelise computation. You first need to replace lapply with parLapply and enter an extra cluster argument.\nThen, an additional preparation step to create the clusters required. makeCluster() function creates the number of cluster that you intend to use. In my computer, I have 6 cores and I will assign 5 cores as the multiple workers.\nlibrary(parallel)\rsystem.time({\rn_cores \u0026lt;- detectCores(logical=FALSE)\rcl \u0026lt;- makeCluster(n_cores-1)\rparLapply(cl , c(124,119,119,197,102), multfun)\r})\r## user system elapsed ## 0.02 0.01 4.54\rstopCluster(cl)\rWhen done, include stopCluster() argument to avoid running R sessions in different clusters in the background.\nTheoretically, I can expect 5X quicker processing with 5 cores. But there are overhead costs. Additional preparation steps such as makecluster() function also takes time.\nWe had much quicker execution by parallel processing. Is there a room for further improvement?\nLet’s look at our multfun function again…\nmultfun \u0026lt;- function(x){ a \u0026lt;- list()\ravc \u0026lt;- rmultinom(1000000, size=2782, prob=rep(1/30, 30)) # Create probability matrix\rfor (i in 1:30){ a[[i]] \u0026lt;- mean(avc[i,1:1000000] \u0026gt;=x) } # Find probabilities for each day\rifelse(do.call(sum,a)/30 \u0026lt;= 0.5, p_val \u0026lt;- 2 * do.call(sum,a)/30, p_val \u0026lt;- 2*(1 - do.call(sum,a)/30))\r}\rIn R, it is possible to do things in multiple ways. Sometimes we need more readable version and sometimes just fast code. I see that multfun uses a list and a for loop. If I find a way without using them I can get a faster run.\n\r\r\rImproved multfun: Define the function without using a loop and list\rMean function in R can be vectorized instead of looping.\nI can achieve the same result what the first multfun() was doing by including what for loop was doing inside the “[ ]”. Mean function will be applied find the total proportion of values equal or bigger than x.\nmultfun_opt \u0026lt;- function(x){ avc \u0026lt;- rmultinom(1000000, size=2782, rep(1/30, 30))\rp \u0026lt;- mean(avc[1:30, 1:1000000] \u0026gt;=x)\rifelse(p \u0026lt;= 0.5, p_val \u0026lt;- 2 * p, p_val \u0026lt;- 2*(1 - p))}\rLet’s check whether improved multfun is faster.\nsystem.time({\rn_cores \u0026lt;- detectCores(logical=FALSE)\rcl \u0026lt;- makeCluster(n_cores-1)\rparLapply(cl , c(124,119,119,197,102), multfun_opt)\r})\r## user system elapsed ## 0.00 0.06 4.32\rstopCluster(cl)\rSince rmultinom is the bottleneck here, we did not see very big improvement in overall function.

We can see that rmultinom() part of takes more than 90% of the processing time.\nIf we are looking further improvement we can focus on it. To improve rmultinom() part, I will isolate it by splitting the multfun into two functions.\n In general, to be able to apply parallel processing we need to be able to dispatch our tasks as functions, with one task going to each processor. We can apply parLapply to execute multiple functions at the same time.   Above, first improvement was using parLapply instead of lapply and second replacing a loop with a faster vectorized operation. Now, we will utilize another approach, dividing a task into smaller pieces.\nI need to create a new rmultinom() function, which I call fastbinom. To keep things simple, it will take only one argument which I will use to divide 1.000.000 rmultinom simulations into 5 equal parts of 200.000 rmultinom simulations. Each will be handled by a different core in my CPU boosting my speed.\nfastbinom \u0026lt;- function(x) {\rrmultinom(x, size=2782, rep(1/30,30)) }\rmultfun_fin \u0026lt;- function(x){ p \u0026lt;- mean(avc[1:30, 1:1000000] \u0026gt;=x)\rifelse(p \u0026lt;= 0.5, p_val \u0026lt;- 2 * p, p_val \u0026lt;- 2*(1 - p))\r}\rHere comes an additional overhead. Since, multfun_fin will be executed on different cores, we need to export the data to each cluster.

It is all about success and failure.\nWhat are binomial distributions and why are they so useful?\rWhen we repeat a set of events like 10 times coin flipping and each single event in a set has two possible outcomes (head or tails) think about Binomial distributions. Each single event here is known as a Bernoulli Trial.\nBi- in binomial distributions refers to the two outcomes usually described as Success or no Success. A “yes” or “no”.\nProbability distributions in general are used to predict future events and often based on nasty looking mathematical formulas. But, there is also a beautiful thing here. For example the specific binomial distribution mathematical function can be used to predict the outcomes of any real life event which has two outcomes.\nLet’s start with a simple example.\nWhy is this interesting?\rFor example, playing with the coins, the two possibilities are getting heads (success) or tails (no success). And let’s say you have a of e.g. 50 times coin flipping. We can repeat this set as many times as we like and record how many times we got heads (success) in each repetition.\nAnd if plot the results we will have a probability distribution plot. And if you make enough repetitions you will approach a binomial probability distribution curve. We will do this in a minute. But, first generate data to draw our plot.\nWe can use R to generate the data. We will generate random data from repeating set of 50-times coin flipping 100000 times and record the number of successes in each repetition.\nrbinom() function can generate a given number of repeated (here 100.000) sets (50 times of coin flipping) of experiments. It requires 3 arguments.\nrbinom(\nn = number of repetitions = 100.000,\nsize = sample size = 50,\np = the probability of success (chance of throwing heads is 0.5))\nR code can be used to find the exact probabilities. Let’s compare the probabilities of getting more than 25, 35 or even 49 heads. You can combine rbinom with mean function to find the percentage of the events with a chosen outcome.\n# Probability of getting 25 or more heads\rmean(rbinom(100000, 50, .5) \u0026gt;= 25)\r## [1] 0.55734\r# Probability of getting 35 or more heads\rmean(rbinom(100000, 50, .5) \u0026gt;= 35)\r## [1] 0.00358\r# Probability of getting 49 or more heads\rmean(rbinom(100000, 50, .5) \u0026gt;= 49)\r## [1] 0\rWe found the probability of throwing 49 or more heads to be 0. But to be technically precise it is one in 375 trillion times\r(= \\(1/((1/(2^{49}) + (1/2^{50})))\\)).\nLet’s visualize our simulation. The bars in red represents the sets which had 35 or more heads.\nlibrary(tidyverse) # ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, # purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats\rlibrary(viridis)\rheads \u0026lt;- rbinom(100000, 50, 0.5)\rheads \u0026lt;- data.frame(heads)\rheads \u0026lt;- heads %\u0026gt;% mutate(events = ifelse(heads \u0026gt; 35, \u0026quot;\u0026gt; 35\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026lt; 35\u0026quot;))\rheads %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=heads, fill = events)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;)) +\rtheme_classic() +\rtheme(text = element_text(size = 18),\rlegend.position = c(0.85, 0.85)) +\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;Number of heads in 50 coin flips\u0026quot;)\r\rBinomial probability distributions help us to understand the likelihood of rare events and to set probable expected ranges.\n\rThe above plot illustrates if we randomly flip a coin 50 times, we will most likely get between 20 to 30 successes (heads) and events such as having more more than 35 successes (heads) out of 50 trials are very unlikely. The bars in red represents the sets which had 35 or more heads.\nSo what are all those will be useful for?\nYou can impress your friends with your ability to use binomial distributions to predict coin flipping outcomes, but let’s look at other real life applications of them.\n\rThe performance of a machine learning model\r\rYou built a machine learning model with a binary outcome. Let’s say pathological image recognition algorithm for liver cancer that is 90% accurate. You tested 100 patients and you want to know your 95% confidence interval? Or your new results showed that your model detected less than 70 patients correctly. Is it possible? Or you should start optimizing your parameters again?\n\rNumber of patients responding to a treatment.\r\rLet’s say you have a new therapy for cancer which has 10% probability to cure a patient. You have 500 patients which took the drug. The expected number of recovering patients is 50. But in your trial 75 patients responded. Is this due to chance or a significant effect? Or you should start looking underlying factors if there is something about the therapy or the patient group?\n\rThink about a hospital emergency station.\r\rYou are a hospital manager and you want to organize the staff numbers correctly for different weekdays. You know total number of patients came in to a emergency station because of alcohol poisoning in a given time period. You can analyse the distribution of patient numbers for each day of the week. Most likely you will have more such cases in the weekends and you need larger staff.\nThis will be also true for other businesses. They can use binomial distributions to calculate changes in demand and plan accordingly.\n\rIf you are running a Webserver.\r\rYou can allocate your resources better by identifying times when traffic will be higher.\nSome other questions in which binomial distributions will come in handy are:\n\rNumber of people who answered ‘yes’ to a survey question\rHow many games a team will win in one season?\rVote counts for a candidate in an election.\rNumber of defective products in a production run.\r\r\rBinomial distributions are common and they have many applications of real life situations.\n\rWe can expand binomial distributions to multinomial distributions when instead there are more than two outcomes for the single event.\nSuch as there are 6 outcomes when rolling a die, or analyzing distributions of eye color types (Black, blue, green etc) in a population. When it is about distributions for events with multiple categories think about multinomial distributions.\nIf the number of observations(n) are large we can think of a multinomial draw as being a series of binomial draws (Gentle, 2003, pp. 198–199). For example, when rolling a die the 6 categories can be thought of a combination of 6 different binomial trials (getting 1, 2 ,3 and so on).\nIf you are not convinced just by reading this, I will simulate how the shape of a multinomial event changes by increasing the number of trials.Let’s use some real life data to apply our knowledge so far. The data comes from TidyTuesday which I introduced in my last post.\nIt contains data about Horror Movies released since 2012. And what I asked was whether horror movies are more likely be released at the 13th each month?\nIf you are in the right mindset anything feels better and if you are not in the mood nothing will make us happy. The mindset we have prior to an event influences what we will feel about an event. This is at least what behavioral scientist Robert Cialdini’s research says.\nImagine you are a horror movie fan and you went to the cinema. On the screen couple of ads are running just before the movie starts. You approach your mobile to turn off the voice and the date catches your attention, it is the 13th.\nAnd usually with the number 13 we associate cursed events. Do you think it will influence your impression about the movie?\nWe don’t know if this is true but I wanted to test whether movie makers have similar ideas and selected 13th as the release date more often than other days. So, I explored Horror movies data and calculated number of releases in different days of the month.\nLet’s look at the data.\nhorror_movies \u0026lt;- readr::read_csv(\u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-10-22/horror_movies.csv\u0026quot;)\rdim(horror_movies)\r## [1] 3328 12\rhead(horror_movies)\r## # A tibble: 6 x 12\r## title genres release_date release_country movie_rating review_rating\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 Gut ~ Drama~ 26-Oct-12 USA \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 3.9\r## 2 The ~ Horror 13-Jan-17 USA \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 3 Slee~ Horror 21-Oct-17 Canada \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 4 Trea~ Comed~ 23-Apr-13 USA NOT RATED 3.7\r## 5 Infi~ Crime~ 10-Apr-15 USA \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 5.8\r## 6 In E~ Horro~ 2017 UK \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## # ... with 6 more variables: movie_run_time \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, plot \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, cast \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;,\r## # language \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, filming_locations \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, budget \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;\rI need some data pre-processing before I can make my visualizations.

So expected movie release per day is 92 (2782 / 30).\nThis is a good example of a multinomial probability distribution with 30 categories, and since the number of samples are large it will approximate a binomial distribution.\nThus, we can apply binomial probability distributions for calculating the probabilities in our multinomial data.\nWe saw above that in some days more movies are released than the expected value. What we want to know is, which days are in the range of random chance and which days there is a significant preference or an aversion to release a movie.\n# Size of our distribution is the total number of movies released n_value \u0026lt;- horror_date_table %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% summarize(n2 = sum(n))\rsize \u0026lt;- n_value$n2\rsize\r## [1] 2782\r# The probability (= success rate = a given outcome to occur = movie released)\rp \u0026lt;- 1/30 # Since it can occur any of the 30 days in a months\rYou can simulate this 2782 movie release dates events 100.000 times with rbinom function and calculate the mean and variance.\n# Simulated statistics\restimates \u0026lt;- rbinom(100000, 2782, 1/30)\r# Simulated mean\rmean(estimates)\r## [1] 92.73831\r# Simulated variance\rvar(estimates)\r## [1] 90.01739\rThe average value is around 92 movies released in one day.\nWe can also calculate theoretical values by the derived mathematical formulas that define the binomial function:\nMean = size * p\nVariance = size * p * (1 - p)\nLet’s calculate.\n# Theoretical statistics\r# Expected mean = size * p\rmean_theoretical \u0026lt;- 2782 * 1/30\rmean_theoretical\r## [1] 92.73333\r# Expected Variance = size * p * (1-p)\rvar_theoretical \u0026lt;- size * 1/30 * (1-1/30)\rvar_theoretical\r## [1] 89.64222\rGreat, simulated and theoretical values are almost the same. So, I can use my simulations to find out 95% confidence interval which will contain the values that can happen due to random chance.\nI will define an interval that contains 95% of probabilities in our simulated distributions. And the values outside will be the ones which were not due to random chance. To do this I need 2.5th and 97.5th quantiles of the distribution.\nWe can do this by the qbinom() function in r. For example qbinom(0.975, size, p) will return the value which will define the cut off which contains 0.975 of the probabilities. And our confidence interval will be the interval between:\nqbinom(0.025, size, p) \u0026lt; Confidence Interval \u0026lt; qbinom(0.975, size, p)\n# Boundaries for p values smaller than 0.05\rlower \u0026lt;- qbinom(0.975, 2782, 1/30)\rlower\r## [1] 112\rupper \u0026lt;- qbinom(0.025, 2782, 1/30)\rupper\r## [1] 75\rmovies \u0026lt;- rbinom(100000, 2782, 1/30)\rmovies \u0026lt;- data.frame(movies)\rmovies \u0026lt;- movies %\u0026gt;% mutate(events = ifelse(movies \u0026gt; qbinom(.025, 2782, 1/30) \u0026amp; movies \u0026lt; qbinom(.975, 2782, 1/30), \u0026quot;95% Conf.

Higher or lower values than this range can not happen due to random chance according to our probability distribution.\n124 movies released at the 13th of any month. This value is above the 97.5th quantile. So it is significant. But what is the exact p value? Let’s define p value first.\n\rHow to calculate the p-value for a binomial test using pbinom?\r P value is the sum of the probability of that event plus the sum of the probabilities of similar events that are equally likely or less likely.   For example in coin flipping, probability of heads is (0.5). If we follow our definition, p value is the sum of the probability of that event (0.5) and similar events which is equally or less likely i.e. tails (0.5). This makes our p value 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.\nSimilarly, in our horror movie data this will be the sum of the probabilities of getting 124 movie releases or events that are equally probable or rarer.\nIn R, pbinom function defines the cumulative probabilities. For example, pbinom(124, 2782, 1/30) will give us the cumulative probabilities of any number of movie releases up to 124. By using 1-pbinom(124, 2782, 1/30) we can find the sum of the probabilities with equal or lower chance than having 124.\nThus, p value for getting at least 124 movie release is;\n# Probability of getting at least 124 movie releases (e.g. the 13th)\rp_val_binom \u0026lt;- 2 * (1 - pbinom(124, 2782, 1/30))\rp_val_binom\r## [1] 0.001335455\rWe multiplied by two because same rare events can happen in the left side of our confidence interval as well.\nLet’s put those p values on our barplot to highlight the significant days.\n# I will add a new column so I can separately define values outside the 95% confidence interval.\rhorror_date_table \u0026lt;- horror_date_table %\u0026gt;% mutate(p_val = 2 * (1 - pbinom(n, 2782, 1/30, lower.tail = ifelse(n\u0026gt;93, TRUE, FALSE)))) %\u0026gt;% mutate(p_val = cut(p_val, breaks = c(-Inf, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, Inf), labels = c(\u0026quot;\u0026lt; 0.001\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;\u0026lt; 0.01\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026lt; 0.05\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;NS\u0026quot;))) # Visualize the significant days p_ci \u0026lt;- horror_date_table %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% mutate(day=fct_reorder(day, n, .desc=TRUE)) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=day, y=n)) +\rgeom_col(aes(fill=p_val)) +\rscale_fill_manual(values = viridis(4)) + theme(\rplot.title = element_text(size=24, color= \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, hjust=0.5, vjust = -1),\rplot.subtitle = element_text(size=36, color= \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, hjust=0.5, vjust = -1),\rpanel.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;), plot.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;),\rpanel.grid = element_blank(),\rtext = element_text(size=18), axis.text.x =element_text(vjust=12, size=17, colour= \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;, face= \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;),\raxis.title.x = element_text(vjust=9.5), axis.text.y=element_blank(),\raxis.ticks= element_blank(), plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, vjust = 10)) +\rlabs(\rcaption= \u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;Day of the Month\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Number of movies released\u0026quot;,\rtitle = \u0026quot;Calculating p values in binomial distributions\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_label(aes(label = n), size=5, fill=\u0026quot;yellow\u0026quot;, alpha=0.9) p_ci\rWe tested our hypothesis about movie makers and calculated the p value and used the pbinom() function and found couple of other days where movies are more or less likely to be released.\nHowever, another widely used way to calculate p values is to calculate the mean of the distribution and its standard deviation and to verify how many standard deviations the observed value is away from the mean (the z score).\nCalculating the p-value by normal approximation\rWhen the sample size is large, binomial distributions can be approximated by a normal distribution.

You need to plot it. And adding statistics to your plots will make it more informative.\nTo evaluate data, we typically use mean and median to define its central tendency and range, quartiles, variance and standard deviation to define how spread it is.\nMean and standard deviation is a good representation of the data if we don’t have extreme values that result in a skewed distribution. But, if we have outliers they might misguide us. In those conditions, median and quartiles will serve us better.\nMedian is the central point which divides the data into half. Quartiles are used to describe the spread of the data. The word comes from the Medieval Latin “quartilis” which means fourth and quartiles break the data into four equal parts.\n The advantage is that they are much less effected by the outliers or skeweness of the data.   For this reason, quartiles are often used along with the median as the best measures of spread.\nThey are often expressed as an Interquartile range (IQR), which is the interval between first and third quartiles and represents 50% of the data points.\nFor example, you measured height of adults in a population, with Interquartile range you can describe a discrete interval centered around the median including 50% of the measurements.\nHere is a representative graph.[source:wikipedia]\nHow to include statistics in ggplot2\rStats make it easier to grasp the data. And different statistics are suited for different data types. For example, you may want to show a 95% confidence interval? or mean? median? or any other statistics which captures the details best for your data.\nSo let’s go through on an example data to understand how statistics can be overlayed in ggplot2. The data is about the effects of two Herbicides (glyphosate \u0026amp; bentazone) on the yield of white mustard (Sinapis alba) seeds.\nFirst, import ggplot2 package and read in the data.\nlibrary(ggplot2)\rpath \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;C:/Users/serda/Downloads/S.alba.csv\u0026quot;\rdata \u0026lt;- read.csv(path)\rstr(data)\r## \u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;: 68 obs. of 4 variables:\r## $ X : int 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\r## $ Dose : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 ...\r## $ Herbicide: Factor w/ 2 levels \u0026quot;Bentazone\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Glyphosate\u0026quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\r## $ DryMatter: num 4.7 4.6 4.1 4.4 3.2 3 3.8 3.9 3.8 3.8 ...\rThese chemicals used at 8 different doses and the yield is measured. I will convert the dose variable as a factor.\ndata$Dose \u0026lt;- as.factor(data$Dose)\rlevels(data$Dose)\r## [1] \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; \u0026quot;10\u0026quot; \u0026quot;20\u0026quot; \u0026quot;40\u0026quot; \u0026quot;80\u0026quot; \u0026quot;160\u0026quot; \u0026quot;320\u0026quot; \u0026quot;640\u0026quot;\rWe can make an initial plot to visualize the data. We’ll plot the yield variable DryMatter against Dose of the Herbicides. We can assign col argument to map different chemical compounds to different colors.\n# I will define a dodge and jitterdodge object to avoid overlapping data points # or stats that we will overlay later\rposn.d \u0026lt;- position_dodge(width=0.2)\rposn.jd \u0026lt;- position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.1, dodge.width=0.2)\rp \u0026lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x=Dose, y=DryMatter, col=Herbicide, fill=Herbicide, group=Herbicide ))\rp + geom_point(position =posn.jd)\rWhat we see here is that, at low doses both Herbicides led similar yields but starting from Dose 40 we see a drastic negative impact of Benzoate on yield.\nOn top of that plot, I want to overlay the min, max and also median and Interquartile range for each set of yield measurements.\nThere are many default functions in ggplot2 which can be used directly such as mean_sdl(), mean_cl_normal() to add stats in stat_summary() layer. But, I will create custom functions here so that we can grasp better what is happening behind the scenes on ggplot2.\nI will create one function to calculate the median and the interquartile range(IQR) 1-3, and another to calculate min(), max() values.\n In order to use the results of a function directly in ggplot2 we need to ensure that the names of the variables match the aesthetics needed for our respective geoms.   # Function for median and IQR\rmedian_IQR \u0026lt;- function(x) {\rdata.frame(y = median(x), # Median\rymin = quantile(x)[2], # 1st quartile\rymax = quantile(x)[4]) # 3rd quartile\r}\r# Function for min, max values\rrange \u0026lt;- function(x) {\rdata.frame(ymin=min(x),\rymax=max(x))\r}\rLet’s replot with the statistics we wanted to overlay. You can use two stat_summary() layers to add our stats. You can set the fun.data argument to the specific function defined above.\n# Updated plot\rp + stat_summary(geom = \u0026quot;linerange\u0026quot;,\rfun.data = median_IQR, position = posn.d, size=3) + stat_summary(geom = \u0026quot;linerange\u0026quot;, fun.data = range, position = posn.d, size=3, alpha=0.5)+ stat_summary(geom = \u0026quot;point\u0026quot;, fun.y = \u0026quot;median\u0026quot;, position = posn.d, size = 3, col = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, shape = \u0026quot;X\u0026quot;)\rIn contrast, to the first plot here we easily see where the median and IQR lays. We can make our comparisions easier. Starting from dose 20, we see that glyphosate clearly outperforms bentazone. Big separation between the IQRs are obvious at doses 40 and 80. At higher doses, differences in IQRs starts to disappear.\nConclusions\rGgplot2 is a flexible package and knowing its intricacies will help you level up your visuals. To understand your data and to convey the insights you want to point out, you can include your choice of custom functions in ggplot stat_summary() layer similarly as we did above or use the default functions.\nThe data we have here was small. With bigger data, it is more crucial to overlay summary statistics of interest for effective visuals.\nUntil next time!\nSerdar\n\r\r","date":1571184000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571217962,"objectID":"5d4fac75b4e8241c2f9554ea127b44be","permalink":"/r/stats-ggplot/","publishdate":"2019-10-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/r/stats-ggplot/","section":"post","summary":"It is hard to understand your data by looking at the numbers on a csv file.

Also, use of insulin and other drugs to control blood glucose in diabetic patients reduced the risk of developing coronary diseases.\nWe are at constant hunt for finding new evidence which environmental factors put us at risk for which diseases. Exposure to certain chemicals (smoking, industry workers) can cause certain types of cancer and our eating habits might put us at higher risk for developing diseases such us diabetes or liver fibrosis.\r\rFigure 1: Photo by Heather Ford on Unsplash\r\rBut not everyone who smokes develop lung cancer or who eats a lot of sugar develop fatty liver disease.

We can now analyse genes from a single cell which was not even possible couple of years back, and extract the knowledge hidden in rare genes or rare cell types.\nSensors collect real time data from patients e.g. in diabetic patients, we started to pool data (real world evidence) generated during the actual use of drugs by patients (e.g. OMOP common data model.

Let’s figure it out with a for loop. and then visualize on a waffle plot.\nI am selecting only variables from 2 to 6 because only those can’t be zero. Let’s count number of zeros.\nHow to count zeros in each column?\nApproach 1: Using a for loop, which() function and []\nzero_rows \u0026lt;- list()\rfor(i in 2:6){\rzero_rows[[i]] \u0026lt;- length(which(diabetes[,i] == 0)) }\rrows_with_zero \u0026lt;- unlist(zero_rows)\rrows_with_zero\r## [1] 5 35 227 374 11\rAs a bonus, I recommend using dplyr package.\nApproach 2: Much simpler with dplyr summarise_all() function\nzeros \u0026lt;- diabetes[,2:6] %\u0026gt;% summarise_all(funs(sum(.==0)))\rt(zeros)\r## [,1]\r## Glucose 5\r## BloodPressure 35\r## SkinThickness 227\r## Insulin 374\r## BMI 11\rFeed those numbers into a waffle plot.\nzeros \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;Glucose\u0026quot; =zeros[1,1], \u0026quot;Blood Pressure\u0026quot; = zeros[1,2], \u0026quot;Skin Thickness\u0026quot;= zeros[1,3], \u0026quot;Insulin\u0026quot; =zeros[1,4], \u0026quot;BMI\u0026quot; = zeros[1,5])\rwaffle(zeros, rows=20) + theme(text = element_text(size=15)) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Number of rows with zero\u0026quot;)\rFor instance, 374 rows of Insulin are zero. Other variables also contain zeros. Something is wrong. It is impossible to have Blood Pressure or Glucose levels at 0. It is unlikely that those are simply entry mistakes. It seems missing values are filled with zeros in the data collection phase.\nHow to circumvent this?\nConvert all zeroes to NAs and then perform Median Imputation\rMost models require numbers, and can’t handle missing data. Throwing out rows is not a good idea since it can lead to biases in your dataset and generate overconfident models.\nMedian imputation lets you model data with missing values. By replacing them with their medians.\nTo do this, I need to change zeros to missing values. I will do this for all the predictors which zero is not plausible(columns 2 to 6).\nfor(i in 2:6){\r# Convert zeros to NAs\rdiabetes[, i][diabetes[, i] == 0] \u0026lt;- NA\r# Calculate median\rmedian \u0026lt;- median(diabetes[, i], na.rm = TRUE)\rdiabetes[, i][is.na(diabetes[, i])] \u0026lt;- median\r}\rCheck if it really happened.\nknitr::kable(head(diabetes))\r\r\r\rPregnancies\r\rGlucose\r\rBloodPressure\r\rSkinThickness\r\rInsulin\r\rBMI\r\rDiabetesPedigreeFunction\r\rAge\r\rOutcome\r\r\r\r\r\r6\r\r148\r\r72\r\r35\r\r125\r\r33.6\r\r0.627\r\r50\r\r1\r\r\r\r1\r\r85\r\r66\r\r29\r\r125\r\r26.6\r\r0.351\r\r31\r\r0\r\r\r\r8\r\r183\r\r64\r\r29\r\r125\r\r23.3\r\r0.672\r\r32\r\r1\r\r\r\r1\r\r89\r\r66\r\r23\r\r94\r\r28.1\r\r0.167\r\r21\r\r0\r\r\r\r0\r\r137\r\r40\r\r35\r\r168\r\r43.1\r\r2.288\r\r33\r\r1\r\r\r\r5\r\r116\r\r74\r\r29\r\r125\r\r25.6\r\r0.201\r\r30\r\r0\r\r\r\r\rFor instance, I see that zero values in the insulin variable is replaced with median of insulin which is 125.\nI will also look at the differences between variables in diabetic versus healthy groups so that I know more which variables might play a role in the Outcome.\nI can also use dplyr functions but I will use compareGroups package because it creates a nice output of the summary statistics in a table format. compareGroups() function will do the analysis and createTable() will output it in a nice format.\nbase \u0026lt;- compareGroups(Outcome~Pregnancies+Glucose+BloodPressure+\rSkinThickness+Insulin+BMI +\rDiabetesPedigreeFunction+Age, data = diabetes)\rsummary_stats \u0026lt;- createTable(base, show.ratio = FALSE, show.p.overall=TRUE)\rsummary_stats\r## ## --------Summary descriptives table by \u0026#39;Outcome\u0026#39;---------\r## ## __________________________________________________________ ## 0 1 p.overall ## N=500 N=268 ## ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ## Pregnancies 3.30 (3.02) 4.87 (3.74) \u0026lt;0.001 ## Glucose 111 (24.7) 142 (29.6) \u0026lt;0.001 ## BloodPressure 70.9 (11.9) 75.1 (12.0) \u0026lt;0.001 ## SkinThickness 27.7 (8.55) 31.7 (8.66) \u0026lt;0.001 ## Insulin 128 (74.4) 165 (101) \u0026lt;0.001 ## BMI 30.9 (6.50) 35.4 (6.60) \u0026lt;0.001 ## DiabetesPedigreeFunction 0.43 (0.30) 0.55 (0.37) \u0026lt;0.001 ## Age 31.2 (11.7) 37.1 (11.0) \u0026lt;0.001 ## ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯\rYou can see here that couple of variables are significantly higher in diabetic patients, such as Pregnancies, glucose, insulin, bmi and so on. This can give hints on what to expect from the linear model.\nSo far, we made some visualizations to understand the dataset better, made some quality checks and cleaning.\nNow, the data is ready for the modeling phase.\n\r\r\rModeling the data (build, fit and validate a model)\rBefore going into any complicated model starting with a simple model is a good idea. It might do surprisingly well and will give us more insights.\nModel assumptions\rOne of the assumptions of logistic regression that it requires large sample size.\nWhat should be the minimum sample size for running logistic regression?\rMinimum sample size is given by the following formula:\nN = 10 k / p\nwhere,\np is the proportion of the least frequent class of the Outcome variable. We have 768 cases of which 500 are diabetic and 268 non diabetic.\np = 268/768 = 0.34\nAnd k is the number of covariates ( the number of predictor variables)\nk = 8\nN = 10 * 8 / 268/768\rN = 229\nSince we have a total of 768 cases we can apply logistic regression model.\n\r\rLogistic Regression Model\rWe will create two random subsets of our data in 80/20 proportion as training and test data.

I will create 1, 30 or 1000 random test sets, build models and compare their accuracies.\nHow to apply multiple train/test split\rTo do this, I will write a function where I can choose number of independent train/test splits.\nIt will return me an average value of the accuracy(auc) of the model after chosen number of iteration.

We have an estimate of our model performance after 1000 random train/test splits. This process is also called Monte-Carlo Cross validation. This approach might give you a less variable, but more biased estimate.\nA more common approach to estimate model performance is k-Fold cross Validation. Where the samples divided into k-folds and one fold is used as a test set, and the remaining k-1 as the training set. This process is run k times until all folds appear once in the test sample.\n\r\rLogistic regression model with k-fold Cross Validation\rI will switch here to caret package. With the Train() function we can test different types of machine learning algorithms and set the cross validation parameters.\nTo make the models below comparable I will create a custom cross validation fold object (d_folds) that I can apply to multiple models.\nI will repeat the logistic regression model with 5 fold cross validation and then we can compare it to monte carlo cross validation.\n# Convert Outcome to a factor with two levels\rdiabetes$Outcome \u0026lt;- ifelse(diabetes$Outcome == 1, \u0026quot;Yes\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;No\u0026quot;)\routcome \u0026lt;- diabetes$Outcome\rd_folds \u0026lt;- createFolds(outcome, k=5)\r# Create a dataframe without the outcome column\rdiab \u0026lt;- diabetes[,-9]\r# MyControl\rmyControl \u0026lt;- trainControl(\rsummaryFunction = twoClassSummary,\rclassProbs = TRUE,\rverboseIter = TRUE,\rsavePredictions = TRUE,\rindex = d_folds\r)\r# Model_glm\rmodel_glm \u0026lt;- train(x = diab, y = outcome,\rmetric = \u0026quot;ROC\u0026quot;,\rmethod = \u0026quot;glm\u0026quot;,\rfamily = binomial(),\rtrControl = myControl\r)\r## + Fold1: parameter=none ## - Fold1: parameter=none ## + Fold2: parameter=none ## - Fold2: parameter=none ## + Fold3: parameter=none ## - Fold3: parameter=none ## + Fold4: parameter=none ## - Fold4: parameter=none ## + Fold5: parameter=none ## - Fold5: parameter=none ## Aggregating results\r## Fitting final model on full training set\rmodel_glm\r## Generalized Linear Model ## ## 768 samples\r## 8 predictor\r## 2 classes: \u0026#39;No\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Yes\u0026#39; ## ## No pre-processing\r## Resampling: Bootstrapped (5 reps) ## Summary of sample sizes: 154, 153, 153, 154, 154 ## Resampling results:\r## ## ROC Sens Spec ## 0.8136093 0.844 0.577431\rHere, My model performance is 0.8136093\n\rGlmnet model\r# Model\rmodel_glmnet \u0026lt;- train(x = diab, y = outcome,\rmetric = \u0026quot;ROC\u0026quot;,\rmethod = \u0026quot;glmnet\u0026quot;, tuneGrid = expand.grid(\ralpha = 0:1,\rlambda = seq(0.0001, 1, length = 20)\r),\rtrControl = myControl\r)\rmodel_glmnet\r## glmnet ## ## 768 samples\r## 8 predictor\r## 2 classes: \u0026#39;No\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Yes\u0026#39; ## ## No pre-processing\r## Resampling: Bootstrapped (5 reps) ## Summary of sample sizes: 154, 153, 153, 154, 154 ## Resampling results across tuning parameters:\r## ## alpha lambda ROC Sens Spec ## 0 0.00010000 0.8201210 0.8615 0.554096935\r## 0 0.05272632 0.8227469 0.8725 0.541977831\r## 0 0.10535263 0.8239613 0.8880 0.506537709\r## 0 0.15797895 0.8242214 0.9005 0.482290806\r## 0 0.21060526 0.8240544 0.9115 0.444025212\r## 0 0.26323158 0.8238034 0.9210 0.420725929\r## 0 0.31585789 0.8233937 0.9290 0.395548794\r## 0 0.36848421 0.8230260 0.9365 0.357313627\r## 0 0.42111053 0.8228119 0.9430 0.331201913\r## 0 0.47373684 0.8224972 0.9505 0.306955010\r## 0 0.52636316 0.8222639 0.9575 0.276166051\r## 0 0.57898947 0.8220894 0.9615 0.254705499\r## 0 0.63161579 0.8219008 0.9670 0.238852423\r## 0 0.68424211 0.8217353 0.9690 0.217396218\r## 0 0.73686842 0.8215489 0.9705 0.200604216\r## 0 0.78949474 0.8214394 0.9725 0.178235166\r## 0 0.84212105 0.8212995 0.9755 0.157704847\r## 0 0.89474737 0.8210990 0.9785 0.138109107\r## 0 0.94737368 0.8209896 0.9800 0.125976962\r## 0 1.00000000 0.8208614 0.9805 0.111980004\r## 1 0.00010000 0.8141708 0.8450 0.575553141\r## 1 0.05272632 0.8232373 0.9040 0.505646599\r## 1 0.10535263 0.8064789 0.9490 0.348028689\r## 1 0.15797895 0.7982626 0.9865 0.118687242\r## 1 0.21060526 0.7913587 0.9995 0.002803738\r## 1 0.26323158 0.5552114 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.31585789 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.36848421 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.42111053 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.47373684 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.52636316 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.57898947 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.63161579 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.68424211 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.73686842 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.78949474 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.84212105 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.89474737 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 0.94737368 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## 1 1.00000000 0.5000000 1.0000 0.000000000\r## ## ROC was used to select the optimal model using the largest value.\r## The final values used for the model were alpha = 0 and lambda = 0.1579789.\rplot(model_glmnet)\rAs we see in the plot, ridge regression (alpha = 0) performed better than the lasso at all lambda values.\nGlmnet model performance is 0.8242214\n\rRandom forest model\rOne of the big diferences between random forest and linear models is that they require “tuning.”\nHyperparameters –\u0026gt; How the model is fit.

Hard part is done. Now, I can identify how many rhymes each poem contains, word usage across different poems, the similarities between them and many more to gain insights about the author.\nI could also analyze the whole book as a single document but by isolating each element I will gain much deeper insight from the data.\nDo you apply similar techniques to isolate chapters or sections from the book or documents to compare and contrast different parts?\nThank you for reading this post.

We used those plots to see which cells express the drug targets in clinical trials or in use.\nAlthough changes associated with fibrosis are well defined the causal factors are not known. Reflecting this we saw that those drugs target many different components of the lung microenvironment. The conquest is on and we hope promising therapies arrive soon.\n\r","date":1568678400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568748206,"objectID":"96b33a2cf8c08c5e0be037d11cb626a3","permalink":"/r/genomics-at-superresolution/","publishdate":"2019-09-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/r/genomics-at-superresolution/","section":"post","summary":"Advances in microfluidic technologies enabled us to barcode single cells in lipid droplets and to resolve genomes of individual cells from a sequencing mixture (e.g, 10X Genomics).

Then they learned that it wasn’t. But they were still pretty sure the sun revolved around the Earth … until that theory went bust, too. For an even longer period of time, smart people have believed story is just a form of entertainment. They’ve thought that beyond the immense pleasure it bestows—the ephemeral joy and deep sense of satisfaction a good story leaves us with—story itself serves no necessary purpose. Sure, our lives from time immemorial would have been far drabber without it, but we’d have survived just fine. Wrong again.\nYellow highlight | Page: 1\rStory, as it turns out, was crucial to our evolution—more so than opposable thumbs.

Because the ease with which we surrender to the stories we read tends to cloud our understanding of stories we write.\nYellow highlight | Page: 4\rEvolution dictates that the first job of any good story is to completely anesthetize the part of our brain that questions how it is creating such a compelling illusion of reality.\nYellow highlight | Page: 4\rSo it’s no surprise that we tend to be utterly oblivious to the fact that beneath every captivating story, there is an intricate mesh of interconnected elements holding it together, allowing it to build with seemingly effortless precision. This often fools us into thinking we know exactly what has us hooked—things like beautiful metaphors, authentic-sounding dialogue, an interesting character—when, in fact, despite how engaging those things appear to be in and of themselves, it turns out they’re secondary. What has us hooked is something else altogether, something that underlies them, secretly bringing them to life: story, as our brain understands it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 6\rIt’s simple. Your brain, along with every other living organism down to the humble amoeba, has one main goal: survival.\nYellow highlight | Page: 6\rYour subconscious brain—which neuroscientists refer to as the adaptive or cognitive unconscious—is a finely tuned instrument, instantly aware of what matters, what doesn’t, why, and, hopefully, what you should do about it.2 It knows you don’t have the time to think,\nYellow highlight | Page: 6\r“Gee, what’s that loud noise?

Here’s how neuroscientist Antonio Damasio sums it up: “The problem of how to make all this wisdom understandable, transmissible, persuasive, enforceable—in a word, of how to make it stick—was faced and a solution found. Storytelling was the solution—storytelling is something brains do, naturally and implicitly.… [I]t should be no surprise that it pervades the entire fabric of human societies and cultures.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 8\rWe think in story. It’s hardwired in our brain. It’s how we make strategic sense of the otherwise overwhelming world around us. Simply put, the brain constantly seeks meaning from all the input thrown at it, yanks out what’s important for our survival on a need-to-know basis, and tells us a story about it, based on what it knows of our past experience with it, how we feel about it, and how it might affect us. Rather than recording everything on a first come, first served basis, our brain casts us as “the protagonist” and then edits our experience with cinema-like precision, creating logical interrelations, mapping connections between memories, ideas, and events for future reference.\nYellow highlight | Page: 8\rStory is the language of experience,\nYellow highlight | Page: 9\rStory evolved as a way to explore our own mind and the minds of others, as a sort of dress rehearsal for the future.\nYellow highlight | Page: 9\rAs a result, story helps us survive not only in the life-and-death physical sense but also in a life-well-lived social sense.\nYellow highlight | Page: 9\rFictional narratives supply us with a mental catalogue of the fatal conundrums we might face someday and the outcomes of strategies we could deploy in them.\nYellow highlight | Page: 10\rNot only do we crave story, but we have very specific hardwired expectations for every story we read,\nNote:Story’s ability to help us safely navigate in daily life.\nYellow highlight | Page: 10\rThe real answer is rather counterintuitive: our expectations have everything to do with the story’s ability to provide information on how we might safely navigate this earthly plane.\nYellow highlight | Page: 10\rWhen a story meets our brain’s criteria, we relax and slip into the protagonist’s skin, eager to experience what his or her struggle feels like, without having to leave the comfort of home.\nYellow highlight | Page: 11\rSo what is a story? A story is how what happens affects someone who is trying to achieve what turns out to be a difficult goal, and how he or she changes as a result. Breaking it down in the soothingly familiar parlance of the writing world, this translates to\nNote:What is a story\nYellow highlight | Page: 11\rThe “goal” is what’s known as the story question.\nYellow highlight | Page: 11\rAs counterintuitive as it may sound, a story is not about the plot or even what happens in it. Stories are about how we, rather than the world around us, change. They grab us only when they allow us to experience how it would feel to navigate the plot. Thus story, as we’ll see throughout, is an internal journey, not an external one.\nNote:***** how we change is what matters in the story\nYellow highlight | Page: 12\rAll the elements of a story are anchored in this very simple premise, and they work in unison to create what appears to the reader as reality, only sharper, clearer, and far more entertaining, because stories do what our cognitive unconscious does: filter out everything that would distract us from the situation at hand.\nYellow highlight | Page: 12\rLet’s face it, we’re all busy.

Having our curiosity piqued is visceral.\nYellow highlight | Page: 14\rthe anticipation of knowledge we’re now hungry for, a sensation caused by that pleasurable rush of dopamine. Because being curious is necessary for survival (What’s that rustling in the bushes?), nature encourages it. And what better way to encourage curiosity than to make it feel good?

After all, unless something is already happening, how can we want to know what happens next?\nYellow highlight | Page: 23\rmarketers, politicians, and televangelists know more about story than most writers. This is because, by definition, they start with something writers often never even think about—the point their story will make.\nYellow highlight | Page: 23\rArmed with that knowledge, they then craft a tale in which every word, every image, every nuance leads directly to it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 25\rThus your first job is to zero in on the point your story is making.\nYellow highlight | Page: 25\rA story is designed, from beginning to end, to answer a single overarching question. As readers we instinctively know this, so we expect every word, every line, every character, every image, every action to move us closer to the answer.\nYellow highlight | Page: 26\rAs one editor put it, “If you can’t summarize your book in a few sentences, rewrite the book until you can.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 26\rWe have no idea who the protagonist is, so we have no way to gauge the relevance or meaning of anything that happens.\nYellow highlight | Page: 26\rWe know who the protagonist is, but she doesn’t seem to have a goal, so we\nYellow highlight | Page: 26\rdon’t know what the point is or where the story is going.\nYellow highlight | Page: 26\rWe know what the protagonist’s goal is, but have no clue what inner issue it forces him to deal with, so everything feels superficial and rather dull.\nYellow highlight | Page: 26\rWe know who the protagonist is and what both her goal and her issue are, but suddenly she gets what she wants, arbitrarily changes her mind, or gets hit by a bus, and now someone else seems to be the main character. • We’re aware of the protagonist’s goal, but what happens doesn’t seem to affect him or whether he achieves it. • The things that happen don’t affect the protagonist in a believable way (if at all), so not only doesn’t she seem like a real person, but we have no idea why she does what she does, which makes it impossible to anticipate what she’ll do next.\nYellow highlight | Page: 27\rWhat was missing in all those failed manuscripts is focus. Without it, the reader has no way to gauge the meaning of anything, and since we’re wired to hunt for meaning in everything—well, you do the math.\nYellow highlight | Page: 27\rThe story isn’t about whether or not the protagonist achieves her goal per se; it’s about what she has to overcome internally to do it.

For instance, a love story can be sweet and lyrical, revealing that people are good eggs after all; it can be hard-nosed and edgy, revealing that people are intense and quirky; it can be cynical and manipulative, revealing that people are best avoided, if possible.\nYellow highlight | Page: 30\rKnowing the theme of your story in advance helps, because it gives you a gauge by which to measure your characters’ responses to the situations they find themselves in.\nYellow highlight | Page: 30\rAs corporate consultants Richard Maxwell and Robert Dickman say in their book The Elements of Persuasion, “For those of us whose business depends on being able to persuade others—which is all of us in business—the key to survival is being able to cut through all the clutter and make the sale. The good news is that the secret of selling is what it has always been—a good story.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 31\rKnowing your story’s point is what helps you cut through all the clutter.\nYellow highlight | Page: 31\rthe instant a reader opens your book, his cognitive unconscious is hunting for a way to make life a little easier, see things a little clearer, understand people a bit better.9 So why not take a second to ask yourself, What is it I want my readers to walk away thinking about? What point does my story make? How do I want to change the way my reader sees the world?\nYellow highlight | Page: 33\rThus we have a bird’s-eye view of the battle between the protagonist and the plot,\nYellow highlight | Page: 34\rShe was glad she had never left Henry. She’d never had a friend as loyal, as kind, as her husband. And yet, standing behind her son, waiting for the traffic light to change, she remembered how in the midst of it all there had been times when she’d felt a loneliness so deep that once, not so many years ago, having a cavity filled, the dentist’s gentle turning of her chin with his soft fingers had felt to her like a tender kindness of almost excruciating depth, and she had swallowed with a groan of longing, tears springing to her eyes.11 In that very specific memory—the dentist’s fleeting, workaday touch—an otherwise ineffable feeling of existential loneliness is made manifest, as palpable as if it had happened to us—because, as we’ll see in chapter 4, as far as our brain is concerned, it actually has. By filtering her story through the thematic lens of loss and human endurance, Strout was able to pluck an otherwise random moment from Olive’s life and use it to give us insight into how Olive sees the world, and at the same time provide a visceral glimpse of the cost of being human.\nYellow highlight | Page: 34\rTheme and Tone: It’s Not What You Say but How You Say It\nYellow highlight | Page: 35\rUnchecked, theme is a bully, a know-it-all.

What qualities are in those who fight their way through triumphantly that are lacking in those who go under?\nYellow highlight | Page: 37\rWhat keeps us reading is the knowledge that Scarlett’s headstrong will, her guts, her nerve—her gumption—is stronger than her need to conform to society’s dictates.\nYellow highlight | Page: 37\rGood question. Here’s the litmus test: the central theme must provide a point of view precise enough to give us specific insight into the protagonist and her internal issue, yet be broad enough to take into account everything that happens (again: the plot).\nYellow highlight | Page: 39\ris it possible to filter the story’s other themes through it?\nYellow highlight | Page: 39\rIn Gone with the Wind, Scarlett’s gumption came first, so—for better or worse—it affects everything else: her love life, her refusal to be constrained by the mores of the day, and her insatiable need to take action when she doesn’t get what she wants. Take action? Ah yes, the plot.\nYellow highlight | Page: 39\rAs we know, it’s the plot that puts the protagonist through his paces, presenting increasingly difficult obstacles that must be overcome if he’s to get within grabbing distance of the brass ring.\nYellow highlight | Page: 39\rBut the plot’s goal isn’t simply to find out whether he snags that brass ring or not; rather, it’s to force him to confront the internal issue that’s keeping him from it in the first place. This issue is sometimes called the protagonist’s “fatal flaw,” and whether a deep-rooted fear, a stubborn misperception, or a dubious character trait, it’s what he’s been battling throughout and what he must finally overcome to have a clear shot at the last remaining obstacle.\nYellow highlight | Page: 39\rIronically, once he overcomes it, he often realizes true success is vastly different from what, up to that very second, he thought it was.\nYellow highlight | Page: 40\rWhat does Scarlett need in order to feel she’s survived what life has thrown at her?\nYellow highlight | Page: 40\rThe answer is her family’s plantation, Tara. Meaning, land. As her father tells her early on, “Land is the only thing in the world that amounts to anything.…” Land is what ties you to your past and makes you who you are. Without it, you are nothing. This becomes Scarlett’s benchmark, the thing that she’s sure will prove she’s survived.\nYellow highlight | Page: 41\rReaders are a surprisingly accepting lot when it comes to willfully blind protagonists, provided they understand the reason for their blindness.\nYellow highlight | Page: 42\rKnowing what the focus of your story is allows you to do for your story what your cognitive unconscious does for you: filter out everything extraneous, everything that doesn’t matter.\nYellow highlight | Page: 43\rDo you know what the point of your story is?

But as we’ve learned, the real story is how what happens affects the protagonist, and what she does as a result.\nYellow highlight | Page: 47\rAnd guess what? Neutrality bores the reader. If it’s neutral, it’s not only beside the point, it detracts from it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 47\rprotagonist must react in a way the reader can see and understand in the moment. This reaction must be specific, personal, and have an effect on whether the protagonist achieves her goal.\nYellow highlight | Page: 47\reverything we experience is automatically coated in emotion. Why? It’s our version of a computer’s ones and zeros, and it’s based on a single question: Will it hurt me, or will it help me?\nYellow highlight | Page: 47\rThis humble equation underlies every aspect of our rich, elegant, complex, and ever-changing sense of self, and how we experience the world around us. According to Damasio, “No set of conscious images of any kind on any topic ever fails to be accompanied by an obedient choir of emotions and consequent feelings.”5 If we’re not feeling, we’re not breathing. A neutral protagonist is an automaton.\nYellow highlight | Page: 48\rIt is the protagonist’s story, after all, so we evaluate everyone and everything else based on how they affect him. Because ultimately what moves a story forward are the protagonist’s actions, reactions, and decisions, rather than the external events that trigger them.\nYellow highlight | Page: 49\rThis is what gives narrative story its unique power.

Our knowledge has ‘cursed’ us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others, because we can’t readily re-create our listeners’ state of mind.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 63\rThat’s why it’s always helpful to have Mark Twain’s pithy observation close at hand: “It’s no wonder that truth is stranger than fiction. Fiction has to make sense.”17\nYellow highlight | Page: 63\rDonald Windham so astutely says, “I disagree with the advice ‘write about what you know.’ Write about what you need to know, in an effort to understand.”18\nYellow highlight | Page: 65\r“agenda” often carries a negative connotation, implying something decidedly Machiavellian, as in duplicitous, manipulative, and cunning. Truth is, agenda is just another word for goal—making it completely neutral and utterly necessary to survival.\nYellow highlight | Page: 65\rIn fact, Steven Pinker defines intelligent life as “using knowledge of how things work to attain goals in the face of obstacles.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 65\rthe most common obstacle in both life and story is figuring out what other people really mean.\nYellow highlight | Page: 67\rMirror neurons allow us to feel what others experience almost as if it were happening to us, the better to infer what “others know in order to explain their desires and intentions with real precision.”4 But here’s the kicker. We don’t just mirror other people. We mirror fictional characters too.\nYellow highlight | Page: 67\rPinker is quick to point out, without a goal, everything is meaningless.6\nYellow highlight | Page: 68\rNone other than former president Dwight D. Eisenhower perfectly captures the essence of a successful story: “We succeed only as we identify in life, or in war, or in anything else a single overriding objective, and make all other considerations bend to that one objective.”7\nYellow highlight | Page: 68\rher internal issue—the thing she struggles with that keeps her from easily achieving\nYellow highlight | Page: 68\rAs we’ll see throughout, this internal struggle is what the reader came for, whether he’s conscious of it or not.\nYellow highlight | Page: 69\rIf you don’t provide your protagonist with a driving deep-seated need that he believes his quest will fulfill, the things that happen will feel random; they won’t add up to anything.\nYellow highlight | Page: 69\rmaybe? If you don’t know what the objective is, everything appears random.\nYellow highlight | Page: 69\rThe action doesn’t add up, so there’s nothing to follow, which makes it impossible to anticipate what will happen next. It is anticipation that creates the intoxicating sense of momentum that hooks a reader, so stories without it remain unread.\nYellow highlight | Page: 71\rCitizen Kane, “Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 71\rNo one ever does anything for no reason, whether or not they’re aware of the reason.\nYellow highlight | Page: 72\ras we know, the heart of the story doesn’t lie in what happens; it beats in what those events mean to the protagonist.\nYellow highlight | Page: 73\rwhat we’ve learned from neuroscience: the brain is built to think socially.

His external goal is to get out of Bedford Falls and build bridges, skyscrapers, and to “do big things.” He believes these goals are one and the same. The movie then chronicles how his external goal is thwarted at every turn, and instead of doing big things, he always does the right thing. In the end, that’s precisely how he achieves his internal goal—making a big difference in many people’s lives—which brings with it the realization that he actually achieved his external goal as well. He did do big things—things that are far more important and enduring than building skyscrapers. Thus, by achieving his internal goal, he was able to redefine his external goal—and, happily, discover that he’d already accomplished it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 74\rBut up to that moment, George fully believed that only by achieving his external goal would his internal goal be met. And as real life makes all too clear, this is rarely the case.\nYellow highlight | Page: 75\rBy defining your protagonist’s internal and external goals, and then pitting them against each other, you can often ignite the kind of external tension and internal conflict capable of driving an entire narrative.\nYellow highlight | Page: 75\rinternal obstacles—usually in the form of longstanding emotional and psychological barriers—that are forever holding her back.

And that, my friends, is boring. Why? Because\nYellow highlight | Page: 77\rwe all have a pretty good idea of what “any person” would do. Where’s the suspense in that? We turn to story to tell us something we don’t know. So while we don’t care a whit about what “any person” would do, we care passionately about what your protagonist would do—as long as we know why.\nYellow highlight | Page: 78\rHaving a firm understanding of what your protagonist’s specific goals and fears mean to her provides you with concrete plot guidelines.\nYellow highlight | Page: 79\rOur goal is to make the reader feel like they know her, and—this is essential—to care enough about her\nYellow highlight | Page: 79\rto want to find out what will happen to her.\nYellow highlight | Page: 82\rIt is this kind of glimpse into someone else’s hopes and fears that makes stories so compelling—and so much more than mere entertainment.\nYellow highlight | Page: 82\rIt’s hard to understand what other people want from us. It’s hard to know what we truly want for ourselves (well, besides another piece of that salted caramel chocolate).

Do you know why? In short, what’s his motivation?\nYellow highlight | Page: 83\rRemember, achieving his goal must fulfill a longstanding need or desire—and force him to face a deep-seated fear in the process.\nYellow highlight | Page: 83\rWhat does achieving her external goal mean to her? How does she think it will affect how she sees herself? What does she think it will say about her? Is she right?

Being wrong feels exactly like being right,\nYellow highlight | Page: 84\rBeing wrong changes how we see—or don’t see—the world.\nYellow highlight | Page: 84\rAnd we’re wrong a lot, partly because in order to survive, we’re wired to draw conclusions about everything we see, whether or not we have all—or any—of the facts; and partly because, more often than not, it’s our cognitive unconscious that deftly constructs the implicit beliefs that then organize and rule our world.\nYellow highlight | Page: 84\rAccording to neuropsychologist Justin Barrett, our implicit or “nonreflective” beliefs are our default mode, constantly working behind the scenes to shape memory and experience.\nYellow highlight | Page: 86\rEveryone here is so nice—I better watch my back. And the scary thing is, we don’t even know we’re doing it until something happens that proves us wrong, and suddenly our implicit belief is catapulted into our conscious mind, where we have to either deal with it or work overtime to rationalize it away.3\nYellow highlight | Page: 86\rT. S. Eliot so aptly noted, “The end of our exploring will be to arrive at where we started, and to know the place for the first time.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 86\rThe best place to start working on a story is long before your poor unsuspecting protagonist shows up on page one. The best place to start is by pinpointing the moment long before, when she first fell prey to the inner issue that’s been skewing her worldview ever since.\nYellow highlight | Page: 87\rBut if you don’t know what’s broke, how can you write a story about fixing it?\nYellow highlight | Page: 88\r“No surprise in the writer, no surprise in the reader.”7 Ditto Robert B. Parker, who says he has no idea where the story is going when he starts writing.\nYellow highlight | Page: 90\rREALITY: Character Bios Should Concentrate Solely on Information Relevant to Your Story\nYellow highlight | Page: 90\rThe same goes for writing a general from-birth-to-the-present bio. The whole point of a story is to filter out the kind of unnecessary information such bios are full of.\nYellow highlight | Page: 91\rHere’s the secret: you are looking only for information that pertains to the story you’re telling. If a story is about a problem, then what you’re looking for is the root of the problem that will blossom on page one.\nYellow highlight | Page: 91\rThat’s why, when writing your protagonist’s bio, the goal is to pinpoint two things: the event in his past that knocked his worldview out of alignment, triggering the internal issue that keeps him from achieving his goal; and the inception of his desire for the goal itself.\nYellow highlight | Page: 92\rThings start out one way and end up another—this is what is meant by a story’s arc.\nYellow highlight | Page: 92\rstory itself unfolds in the space between the “before” and the “after.” It chronicles the exhilarating time when things are in flux, giving the reader the illusion that it really could go either way.\nYellow highlight | Page: 92\rThus what you’re looking for when you write your character bios is the specific before that leads to the moment when suddenly everything is in flux.\nYellow highlight | Page: 92\r“before” is the yardstick that allows the reader to measure the protagonist’s progress toward “after.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 94\r“Character is action”—meaning the things we do reveal who we are, especially because, as Gazzaniga reminds us, “Our actions tend to reflect our automatic intuitive thinking or beliefs.”13 Story is often about a protagonist coming to realize what’s really causing him to do the things he does, at which point he either celebrates, because he’s better than he thought, or begins making amends, because he’s worse.\nYellow highlight | Page: 96\rIf you can’t picture it, it’s general. If you can see it, it’s specific.\nYellow highlight | Page: 102\rWhen you close your eyes, can you envision what happens, or is it still conceptual?

S. Ramachandran agrees: “Humans excel at visual imagery.\nYellow highlight | Page: 106\rDamasio says, “Smart brains are also extremely lazy. Anytime they can do less instead of more, they will, a minimalist philosophy they follow religiously.”6\nYellow highlight | Page: 106\rThe point is, if I ask you to think about something, you can decide not to. But if I make you feel something? Now I have your attention. Feeling is a reaction; our\nYellow highlight | Page: 107\rfeelings let us know what matters to us, and our thoughts have no choice but to follow.\nYellow highlight | Page: 107\rFacts that don’t affect us—either directly or because we can’t imagine how the facts affect someone else—don’t matter to us. And that explains why one personalized story has infinitely more impact than an impersonal generalization, even though the scope of the generalization is a thousand times greater.\nYellow highlight | Page: 107\rFeel first. Think second. That’s the magic of story. Story takes a general situation, idea, or premise and personifies it via the very specific.\nYellow highlight | Page: 112\rnot only do we think in story and in images, but as cognitive linguist George Lakoff points out, although we may not always know it, we also think in metaphor.8 Metaphor is how the mind “couches the abstract concepts in concrete terms.”9\nYellow highlight | Page: 112\rBelieve it or not, we utter about six metaphors a minute.\nYellow highlight | Page: 113\rTo quote Aristotle’s perfect definition: a “metaphor consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to something else.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rBecause the reader has no point of reference, the best she can do is make up something.\nYellow highlight | Page: 117\rMary Poppins’ sage advice in mind: enough is as good as a feast.\nYellow highlight | Page: 118\rthat as with most things in life, less is more.\nYellow highlight | Page: 118\rREALITY: Unless They Convey Necessary Information, Sensory Details Clog a Story’s Arteries\nYellow highlight | Page: 121\rThe description of a room should reveal something about the person\nYellow highlight | Page: 121\rwho lives in it or hint at the whereabouts of the missing diamond or tell us something crucial about the zeitgeist of the community in which the story unfolds—or better yet, all three.\nYellow highlight | Page: 122\rSo if you want to write a novel that inspires people you’ve never even met to call their friends and say, “You gotta read this book,” you need to root through your story and make sure you’ve translated anything brain-numbingly vague, abstract, or generic into something that’s surprisingly specific, deliciously tangible, and grippingly visceral.\nYellow highlight | Page: 123\rDo all the “sensory details”—that is, what something tastes, feels, or looks like—have an actual story reason to be there, beyond “just because”? You want to be sure each sensory detail is strategically placed to give us insight into\nYellow highlight | Page: 123\ryour characters, your story, and perhaps even your theme.

So most of the time we do our best to avoid both. This isn’t easy, since the only real constant is change, and change is driven by conflict. This or that? Me or you? Chocolate or vanilla?\nYellow highlight | Page: 126\rAnd there’s the paradox: we survived because we’re risk takers, but our goal is to stay safe by not changing an iota unless we absolutely have to. Talk about conflict! And that brings us right back to story. Story’s job is to tackle exactly how we handle that conflict, which boils down to this: the battle between fear and desire.\nYellow highlight | Page: 127\rIndeed, it ripples through the story in the guise of mounting tension, engendering in the reader that delicious dopamine-driven sensation we’re addicted to when it comes to a good tale: suspense, the desire to find out what’s really going on.\nYellow highlight | Page: 127\ra recent study using magnetic resonance imaging revealed that intense social rejection activates the same areas in the brain that physical pain does.\nYellow highlight | Page: 128\rasked him how he felt about conflict in his real life.

So, although we feel Juliet’s anguish on awaking to find Romeo lifeless by her side, we never once lose sight of the fact that our own beloved is, in fact, snoring peacefully in the theater seat next to us. And that, my friends, is what makes stories so deeply satisfying. We get to try on trouble, pretty much risk-free.\nYellow highlight | Page: 129\rAnd so in literature, not as in life, the goal is to embrace conflict and harness it to suspense. Now, for the sixty-four-thousand-dollar question: how do you translate impending conflict into ongoing suspense?\nYellow highlight | Page: 144\rAntonio Damasio:\nYellow highlight | Page: 146\rKathryn Schulz of Being Wrong attests: “We think this one thing is going to happen, and something else happens instead.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 146\rwe’ll take a look at why “show, don’t tell” is a matter of why rather than what; and we’ll introduce the all-important “And so?” test to guarantee that neither cause-and-effect trajectory ever goes off the rails.\nYellow highlight | Page: 146\rAs we know, both life and story are driven by emotion, but what they’re ordered by is logic.\nYellow highlight | Page: 152\rSince stories are about how what happens affects someone—Joe, for instance—the reason he popped the balloon is more important than the fact that he popped it.

Can we see how this changed his assessment of what’s going on and how he’s adjusted his game plan accordingly?\nYellow highlight | Page: 157\rNotice that once again it’s the protagonist’s internal reaction to what happens that not only dictates what happens next but also gives it meaning.\nYellow highlight | Page: 159\rstory is driven by the protagonist’s internal struggle,\nYellow highlight | Page: 159\rplot twists tend to stem from her attempt to get the most by giving up the least.\nYellow highlight | Page: 159\rAnd just like in real life, as we’ll explore in depth in the next chapter, this usually only succeeds in making the situation worse.\nYellow highlight | Page: 159\rwe’re wired to predict what will happen next, and the way we do this is by charting patterns.\nYellow highlight | Page: 160\rSince a huge part of the pleasure of reading is trying to figure out what’s going to happen, readers will be spinning possible scenarios all on their own—\nYellow highlight | Page: 161\rEach thing you add to your story is like a drop of paint falling into a bowl of clear water.\nNote:metaphor\nYellow highlight | Page: 161\rIt spreads and colors everything.

It’s like the one, two, three of a waltz.

What I offer you is a synthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out a long time ago as well as the most compelling discoveries scientists have made recently.\nPink highlight | Location: 188\rMy contribution, I hope, is to find the ideas that matter most and connect them in a way that is highly actionable. Anything wise in these pages you should credit to the many experts who preceded me. Anything foolish, assume it is my error.\nPink highlight | Location: 195\rBehavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you offered the right reward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain way. But while Skinner’s model did an excellent job of explaining how external stimuli influenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior. Internal states—our moods and emotions—matter, too. In recent decades, scientists have begun to determine the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behavior. This research will also be covered in these pages.\nOrange highlight | Location: 246\rWHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE\nPink highlight | Location: 247\rIt is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.\nPink highlight | Location: 248\rToo often, we convince ourselves that massive success\nPink highlight | Location: 248\rrequires massive action.\nYellow highlight | Location: 249\rWhether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.\nOrange highlight | Location: 250\rMeanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done.12 Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.\nYellow highlight | Location: 259\rHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement.13\nOrange highlight | Location: 260\rThe same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.\nOrange highlight | Location: 277\rSimilarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination.\nOrange highlight | Location: 279\rSuccess is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.\nOrange highlight | Location: 284\rYour outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of\nOrange highlight | Location: 285\ryour eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.\nOrange highlight | Location: 287\rIf you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line.\nYellow highlight | Location: 288\rAre you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self.\nBlue highlight | Location: 290\rTime magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.\nYellow highlight | Location: 319\rThe ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change. Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This pattern\nBlue highlight | Location: 321\rshows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months.18 Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.\nYellow highlight | Location: 324\rSimilarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.\nYellow highlight | Location: 335\rWhen you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. The outside\nYellow highlight | Location: 354\rAll big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision.\nYellow highlight | Location: 360\rFORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD\nYellow highlight | Location: 365\rbegan to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.\nYellow highlight | Location: 367\rGoals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.\nYellow highlight | Location: 379\rlife. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.\nYellow highlight | Location: 381\rprogress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.\nYellow highlight | Location: 383\rGoal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias.\nYellow highlight | Location: 395\rAchieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement.\nYellow highlight | Location: 397\rWhen you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.\nYellow highlight | Location: 400\rThe implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.\nYellow highlight | Location: 404\rFurthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness.\nYellow highlight | Location: 407\rA systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.\nYellow highlight | Location: 414\rThe purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.\nYellow highlight | Location: 420\rYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.\nYellow highlight | Location: 442\rFew things can have a more powerful impact on your life than improving your daily habits.\nYellow highlight | Location: 448\rChanging our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.\nYellow highlight | Location: 459\rThe third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.\nBlue highlight | Location: 461\rOutcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.\nBlue highlight | Location: 464\rMany people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.\nBlue highlight | Location: 470\rImagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says,\nBlue highlight | Location: 470\r“No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs. The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who smokes.\nBlue highlight | Location: 474\rMost people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).” They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change.\nBlue highlight | Location: 483\rBehavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.\nBlue highlight | Location: 486\rhard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed who you are.\nBlue highlight | Location: 497\rThe ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.\nYellow highlight | Location: 499\rThe more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.\nYellow highlight | Location: 502\rOnce your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.\nYellow highlight | Location: 505\rImprovements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.\nYellow highlight | Location: 506\rThe goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. ■ The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. ■ The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.\nBlue highlight | Location: 510\rYour behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either consciously or nonconsciously.fn1\nBlue highlight | Location: 515\rthemselves to train. Doing the right thing is easy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.\nBlue highlight | Location: 528\rWhen you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact.\nBlue highlight | Location: 537\rProgress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.\nBlue highlight | Location: 542\rYour identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.fn2 More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person.\nBlue highlight | Location: 546\rThe more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”\nBlue highlight | Location: 557\rEach experience in life modifies your self-image, but it’s unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change.\nBlue highlight | Location: 561\rIn this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.\nBlue highlight | Location: 561\rThis is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit.6 We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.\nBlue highlight | Location: 566\rEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change.\nBlue highlight | Location: 568\rSmall habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements. Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.\nBlue highlight | Location: 576\rEach habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things.\nBlue highlight | Location: 577\rWhen the votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.\nBlue highlight | Location: 583\rIt is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.\nBlue highlight | Location: 591\rFor example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?” It’s probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus shifts from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is consistent and reliable (identity-based).\nBlue highlight | Location: 598\rOnce you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity.\nBlue highlight | Location: 600\rShe figured if she acted like a healthy person long enough, eventually she would become that person. She was right.\nBlue highlight | Location: 604\rThe focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.\nBlue highlight | Location: 606\rIdentity change is the North Star of habit change.\nBlue highlight | Location: 608\r“Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?” The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder. And that’s why we are starting here.\nBlue highlight | Location: 610\rYou have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You can\nBlue highlight | Location: 611\rchoose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. And this brings us to the deeper purpose of this book and the real reason habits matter.\nBlue highlight | Location: 619\r■ There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.\nBlue highlight | Location: 621\rThe most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.\nBlue highlight | Location: 622\rYour identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.\nBlue highlight | Location: 624\rBecoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.\nBlue highlight | Location: 625\rThe real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.\nBlue highlight | Location: 649\rA habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.\nBlue highlight | Location: 650\rThe process of habit formation begins with trial and error. Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you come across a problem, you’re not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndike’s cat, you’re just trying things out to see what works.\nBlue highlight | Location: 663\rAs behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”\nBlue highlight | Location: 670\rHabits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution. The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.7\nBlue highlight | Location: 677\rHabits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.\nBlue highlight | Location: 682\rHabits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In\nBlue highlight | Location: 697\rFirst, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex.\nYellow highlight | Location: 703\rCravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides. You are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth. You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be entertained. Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later.\nYellow highlight | Location: 709\rFor someone who rarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are just background noise. Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.\nYellow highlight | Location: 716\rhabit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.\nYellow highlight | Location: 721\rSecond, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones.11 Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.\nYellow highlight | Location: 745\rAll behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you face.\nYellow highlight | Location: 785\rThe ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. ■ Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.\nYellow highlight | Location: 788\rThe Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.\nPink highlight | Location: 813\rThe human brain is a prediction machine.5 It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes\nPink highlight | Location: 814\racross. Whenever you experience something repeatedly—like a paramedic seeing the face of a heart attack patient or a military analyst seeing a missile on a radar screen—your brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use.\nPink highlight | Location: 845\rit. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”\nYellow highlight | Location: 856\rPointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent.10 The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is “point-only,” and “within two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.”11\nYellow highlight | Location: 861\rMy wife does something similar. Whenever we are preparing to walk out the door for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essential items in her packing list. “I’ve got my keys. I’ve got my wallet. I’ve got my glasses. I’ve got my husband.”\nPink highlight | Location: 911\rThe first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them.\nPink highlight | Location: 925\rThe process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.\nYellow highlight | Location: 980\rGive your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why. As the writer Jason Zweig noted, “Obviously you’re never going to just work out without conscious thought.9 But like a dog salivating at a bell, maybe you start to get antsy around the time of day you normally\nYellow highlight | Location: 984\rwork out.”\nPink highlight | Location: 1,009\rWhen it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,032\rAfter I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty seconds. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for the day. After I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin my first task.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,094\rThe 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious. ■ The two most common cues are time and location. ■ Creating an implementation\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,097\rintention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location. ■ The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. ■ Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit. ■ The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,118\rPeople often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are.2 If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of cookies on the counter, I’ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn’t been thinking about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily feel hungry.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,126\rIn 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E).3 It didn’t take long\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,132\rFor example, items at eye level tend to be purchased more than those down near the floor.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,136\rThe more obviously available a product or service is, the more likely you are to try it. People drink Bud Light because it is in every bar and visit Starbucks because it is on every corner.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,138\rWe like to think that we are in control. If we choose water over soda, we assume it is because we wanted to do so. The truth, however, is that many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,147\rThe most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision. The human body has about eleven million sensory receptors.7 Approximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that half of the brain’s resources are used on vision.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,152\rAs a result, you can imagine how important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,160\rthe homes with the meters located in the main hallway used less electricity. When their energy use was obvious and easy to track, people changed their behavior.9\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,185\rThe same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you’ll think about your habit throughout the day.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,188\rEnvironment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people live in a world others have created for them.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,190\rEnvironment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,192\rThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. For example, many people drink more in social situations than they would ever drink\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,195\ralone. The trigger is rarely a single cue, but rather the whole situation: watching your friends order drinks, hearing the music at the bar, seeing the beers on tap.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,196\rWe mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur: the home, the office, the gym. Each location develops a connection to certain habits and routines. You establish a particular relationship with the objects on your desk, the items on your kitchen counter, the things in your bedroom.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,198\rOur behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,199\rStop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,208\rThe power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be easier to change in a new environment.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,209\rIt helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a new place—a different coffee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you seldom use—and create a new routine there.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,211\rIt is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,213\rBut when you step outside your normal environment, you leave your behavioral biases behind.13 You aren’t battling old environmental cues, which allows new habits to form without interruption.14\nPink highlight | Location: 1,216\rWant to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a rooftop patio, or a building with expansive architecture. Take a break from the space where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your current thought patterns.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,218\rTrying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on autopilot at your regular supermarket. Try a new grocery store. You may find it easier to avoid unhealthy food when your brain doesn’t automatically know where it is located in the store.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,221\rThe mantra I find useful is “One space, one use.”\nPink highlight | Location: 1,228\rWhenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—and the easier ones will usually win out.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,234\renough. If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for reading,\nPink highlight | Location: 1,236\rhis phone only for social media and texting. Every habit should have a home.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,237\rIf you can manage to stick with this strategy, each context will become associated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Habits thrive under predictable circumstances like these.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,239\rIf you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,240\rA stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,258\rRobins found that when soldiers who had been heroin users returned home, only 5 percent of them became re-addicted within a year, and just 12 percent relapsed within three years.

The idea that a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is deeply embedded in our culture.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,274\rRecent research, however, shows something different. When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,278\rThe people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often.6 So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,285\rThe cues were still internalized; she just hadn’t been exposed to them in a long time.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,289\rShowing pictures of blackened lungs\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,289\rto smokers leads to higher levels of anxiety, which drives many people to reach for a cigarette.10 If you’re not careful about cues, you can cause the very behavior you want to stop.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,291\rBad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food.

This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,321\rThe inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible. ■ Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten. ■ People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations.

A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality—\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,372\rlike a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than usual.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,373\rHumans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions of reality. Junk food, for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. After spending hundreds of thousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the wild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value on salt, sugar, and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and they were quite rare when our ancient ancestors were roaming the savannah. When you don’t know where your next meal is coming from, eating as much as possible is an excellent strategy for survival.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,377\rToday, however, we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food is abundant, but your brain continues to crave it like it is scarce. Placing a high value on salt, sugar, and fat is no longer advantageous to our health, but the craving persists because the brain’s reward centers have not changed for approximately fifty thousand years. The modern food industry relies on stretching our Paleolithic instincts beyond their evolutionary purpose.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,384\rEntire departments are dedicated to optimizing how a product feels in your mouth—a quality known as orosensation. French fries, for example, are a potent combination—golden brown and crunchy on the outside, light and smooth on the inside.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,389\rBut foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep the experience novel and interesting, encouraging you to eat more.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,393\rStephan Guyenet, a neuroscientist who specializes in eating behavior and obesity, says, “We’ve gotten too good at pushing our own buttons.”\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,395\rThe modern food industry, and the overeating habits it has spawned, is just one example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: Make it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,397\rLook around. Society is filled with highly engineered versions of reality that are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in. Stores feature mannequins with exaggerated hips and breasts to sell clothes. Social media delivers more “likes” and praise in a few minutes than we could ever get in the office or at home.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,400\rAdvertisements are created with a combination of ideal lighting, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits—even the model doesn’t look like the person in the final image. These are the supernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate features that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result, driving us into excessive shopping habits, social media habits, porn habits, eating habits, and many others.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,406\rCompared to nature, these pleasure-packed experiences are hard to resist. We have the brains of our ancestors but temptations they never had to face.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,408\rWhile it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by understanding what a craving is and how it works. We begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share—the dopamine spike.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,412\rScientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring a neurotransmitter called dopamine.fn1\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,421\rEven though dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn’t want it anymore. The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped.11\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,424\rIn one study, mice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time they poked their nose in a box. Within minutes, the mice developed a craving so\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,425\rstrong they began poking their nose into the box eight hundred times per hour.12 (Humans are not so different: the average slot machine player will spin the wheel six hundred times per hour.13)\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,428\rHabits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop.14 Every behavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,431\rFor years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary movement.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,433\rdopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,436\rWhenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,438\rIt is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,439\rInterestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward.18 This is one reason the anticipation of an experience can often feel better than the attainment of it. As a child, thinking about Christmas morning can be better than opening the gifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more enjoyable than actually being on vacation. Scientists refer to this as the difference between “wanting” and “liking.”\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,459\rYour brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,459\rThe wanting centers in the brain are large: the brain stem, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal striatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal cortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are much smaller. They are often referred to as “hedonic hot spots” and are distributed like tiny islands throughout the brain. For instance, researchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens is activated during wanting.19 Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is activated during liking.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,464\rThe fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,465\rof the crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response. These insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change. We need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the first place. This is where a strategy known as temptation bundling comes into play.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,493\rTemptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.”23 In other words, even if you don’t really want to process overdue work emails, you’ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do something you really want to do along the way.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,501\rAfter I get my morning coffee, I will say one thing I’m grateful for that happened yesterday (need). After I say one thing I’m grateful for, I will read the news (want).\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,510\rWe began this chapter by discussing supernormal stimuli, which are heightened versions of reality that increase our desire to take action. Temptation bundling is one way to create a heightened version of any habit by connecting it with something you already want.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,514\rThe 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive. ■ The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. ■ Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act. ■ It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike. ■ Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,544\rThe Polgar sisters grew up in a culture that prioritized chess above all else—praised them for it, rewarded them for it. In their world, an obsession with chess was normal. And as we are about to see, whatever habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll find.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,552\rAs Charles Darwin noted, “In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.” As a result, one of the deepest human desires is to belong. And this ancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern behavior.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,564\rWe imitate the habits of three groups in particular:2 The close. The many. The powerful.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,570\rWe pick up habits from the people around us. We copy the way our parents handle arguments, the way our peers flirt with one another, the way our coworkers get results. When your friends smoke pot, you give it a try, too. When your wife has a habit of double-checking that the door is locked before going to bed, you pick it up as well.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,585\rOne of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. New habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every day. If you are surrounded by fit people, you’re more likely to consider working out to be a common habit. If you’re surrounded by jazz lovers, you’re more likely to believe it’s reasonable to play jazz every day. Your culture sets your expectation for what is “normal.” Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise together.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,590\rTo make your habits even more attractive, you can take this strategy one step further. Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. Steve Kamb, an entrepreneur in New York City, runs a company called Nerd Fitness, which “helps nerds, misfits, and mutants lose weight,\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,593\rget strong, and get healthy.” His clients include video game lovers, movie fanatics, and average Joes who want to get in shape.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,594\rbut if you are already similar to the other members of the group in some way—say, your mutual love of Star Wars—change becomes more appealing because it feels like something people like you already do.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,596\rNothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It transforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on your own. Your identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,599\rWe are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,626\rWhenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, “What is everyone else doing?” We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying, eating, and travel habits. It’s usually a smart strategy. There is evidence in numbers.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,629\rBut there can be a downside. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. For example, one study found that when a chimpanzee learns an effective way to crack nuts open as a member of one group and then switches to a new group that uses a less effective strategy, it will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to blend in with the rest of the chimps.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,633\rThe reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,635\rThe human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants to get along with others. This is our natural mode. You can override it—you can choose to ignore the group or to stop caring what other people think—but it takes work. Running against the grain of your culture requires extra effort.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,637\rWhen changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,641\rHistorically, a person with greater power and status has access to more resources, worries less about survival, and proves to be a more attractive mate.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,643\rWe are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration, and status. We want to be the one in the gym who can do muscle-ups or the musician who can play the hardest chord progressions or the parent with the most accomplished children because these things separate us from the crowd. Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,645\rThis is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly effective people. We try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,649\rHigh-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of others. And that means if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,650\rWe are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our status. We trim our hedges and mow our lawn because we don’t want to be the slob of the neighborhood. When our mother comes to visit, we clean up the house because we don’t want to be judged. We are continually wondering “What will others think of me?” and altering our behavior based on the answer.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,659\rThe culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. ■ We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. ■ We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). ■ One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,665\rsomething in common with the group. ■ The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual.

New versions of old vices. The underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same. The specific habits we perform differ based on the period of history.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,721\rYour current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it. Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. As we covered\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,723\rin our discussion of the 1st Law, your brain is continually absorbing information and noticing cues in the environment. Every time you perceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction about what to do in the next moment.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,734\rTwo people can look at the same cigarette, and one feels the urge to smoke while the other is repulsed by the smell. The same cue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on your prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,736\rThese predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically describe a craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can apply.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,741\rA craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state. When the temperature falls, there is a gap between what your body is currently sensing and what it wants to be sensing. This gap between your current state and your desired state provides a reason to act.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,744\rDesire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,747\rOur feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current state or to make\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,747\ra change. They help us decide the best course of action.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,749\rAs the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, “It is emotion that allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.”\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,753\rIn time, you learn to predict that checking social media will help you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow you to forget your fears. Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,756\rYou can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. For instance, we often talk about everything we have to do in a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner for your family. Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.4 You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,763\rThe key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,764\rI once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. When asked if it was difficult being confined, he responded, “I’m not confined to my wheelchair—I am liberated by it.5 If it wasn’t for my wheelchair, I would be bed-bound and never able to leave my house.” This shift in perspective completely transformed how he lived each day.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,767\rReframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,773\rmoney you save this month increases your purchasing power next month.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,777\rPregame jitters. Many people feel anxious before delivering a big presentation or competing in an important event. They experience quicker breathing, a faster heart rate, heightened arousal. If we interpret these feelings negatively, then we feel threatened and tense up. If we interpret these feelings positively, then we can respond with fluidity and grace. You can reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.”7\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,782\rwith a particular habit or situation. If you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation ritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,786\rEd Latimore, a boxer and writer from Pittsburgh, benefited from a similar strategy without knowing it.8 “Odd realization,” he wrote. “My focus and concentration goes up just by putting my headphones [on] while writing. I don’t even have to play any music.” Without realizing it, he was conditioning himself. In the beginning, he put his headphones on, played some music he enjoyed, and did focused work. After doing it five, ten, twenty times, putting his headphones on became a cue that he automatically associated with increased focus. The craving followed naturally.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,792\rWhile it physically warmed me up to play, more importantly, it put me in the right mental state. I began to associate my pregame ritual with feeling competitive and focused.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,799\rOnce established, you can break it out anytime you need to change your emotional state. Stressed at work? Take three deep breaths and smile. Sad about life? Three deep breaths and smile. Once a habit has been built, the cue can prompt a craving, even if it has little to do with the original situation.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,801\rThe key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the associations you have about them. It’s not easy, but if you can reprogram your predictions, you can transform a hard habit into an attractive one.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,807\rYour habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,811\rHabits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings.

Everyone on the left side of the classroom, he explained, would be in the “quantity” group. They would be graded solely on the amount of work they produced. On the final day of class, he would tally the number of photos submitted by each student. One hundred photos would rate an A, ninety photos a B, eighty photos a C, and so on.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,846\rMeanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the “quality” group. They would be graded only on the excellence of their work. They would only need to produce one photo during the semester, but to get an A, it had to be a nearly perfect image. At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best photos were produced by the quantity group. During the semester, these students were busy taking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting, testing out various methods in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. In the process of creating hundreds of photos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile, the quality group sat around speculating about perfection. In the end, they had little to show for their efforts other than unverified theories and one mediocre photo.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,853\rIt is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle.

As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”2\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,856\rI refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,858\rAction, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that’s motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that’s action. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that’s motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that’s action.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,867\rIt’s easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you’re still making progress. You think, “I’ve got conversations going with four potential clients right now. This is good. We’re moving in the right direction.” Or, “I brainstormed some ideas for that book I want to write. This is coming together.”\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,871\rWhen preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,872\rIf you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,877\rNeuroscientists call this long-term potentiation, which refers to the strengthening of connections between neurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,886\rWhen scientists analyzed the brains of taxi drivers in London, they found that the hippocampus—a region of the brain involved in spatial memory—was significantly larger in their subjects than in non–taxi drivers.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,896\rEach time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular neural circuit associated with that habit. This means that simply putting in your reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,899\rAll habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity.

They are the cab, not the gym.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,122\rTwo-Minute Rule, which states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,125\r■ “Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.” ■ “Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga mat.” ■ “Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.” ■ “Fold the laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks.” ■ “Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,137\rYour goal might be to run a marathon, but your gateway habit is to put on your running shoes.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,142\rInstead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have to standardize before you can optimize.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,145\rThe more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. By doing the same warm-up before every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peak performance.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,147\rBy following the same creative ritual, you make it easier to get into the hard work of creating.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,147\rconsistent power-down habit, you make it easier to get to bed at a reasonable time each night.6 You may not be able to automate the whole process, but you can make the first action mindless.

If you show up at the gym five days in a row—even if it’s just for two minutes—you are casting votes for your new identity. You’re not worried about getting in shape. You’re focused on becoming the type of person who doesn’t miss\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,167\rworkouts. You’re taking the smallest action that confirms the type of person you want to be.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,182\rHabits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward. ■ Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one. ■ The Two-Minute Rule states,\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,186\r“When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” ■ The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. ■ Standardize before you optimize.

This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it difficult. If you find yourself continually struggling to follow through on your plans, then you can take a page from Victor Hugo and make\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,201\ryour bad habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a commitment device. A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future.2 It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones. When Victor Hugo shut his clothes away so he could focus on writing, he was creating a commitment device.4 fn2\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,212\rCommitment devices are useful because they enable you to take advantage of good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation. Whenever I’m looking to cut calories, for example, I will ask the\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,214\rwaiter to split my meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served. If I waited until the meal came out and told myself “I’ll just eat half,” it would never work.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,215\rThe key is to change the task such that it requires more work to get out of the good habit than to get started on\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,218\reffort and may cost money. Commitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing in the future by making bad habits difficult in the present. However, we can do even better. We can make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,236\rThe best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act. The brilliance of the cash register was that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing practically impossible. Rather than trying to change the employees, it made the preferred behavior automatic.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,272\rAs mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead wrote, “Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.”\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,277\rTechnology creates a level of convenience that enables you to act on your smallest whims and desires. At the mere suggestion of hunger, you can have food delivered to your door. At the slightest hint of boredom, you can get lost in the vast expanse of social media.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,278\rWhen the effort required to act on your desires becomes effectively zero, you can find yourself slipping into whatever impulse arises at the moment. The downside of automation is that we can find ourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but ultimately more rewarding, work.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,284\r(I’m not the only one. The average person spends over two hours per day on social media.8 What could you do with an extra six hundred hours per year?)\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,285\rDuring the year I was writing\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,286\rthis book, I experimented with a new time management strategy.

This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,383\rTasty flavors and the feeling of a fresh mouth provided little bits of immediate reinforcement and made the product satisfying to use. Consumption skyrocketed, and Wrigley became the largest chewing gum company in the world.9\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,393\rStories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. You learn what to do in the future based on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished for doing) in the past. Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.\nOrange highlight | Location: 2,395\rThe first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the habit loop. But there is a trick. We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction.\nOrange highlight | Location: 2,402\rYou are constantly focused on the present or the very near future. You live in what scientists call an immediate-return environment\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,406\rYou live in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.\nOrange highlight | Location: 2,407\rThe human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment. The earliest remains of modern humans,\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,408\rknown as Homo sapiens sapiens, are approximately two hundred thousand years old.12 These were the first humans to have a brain relatively similar to ours. In particular, the neocortex—the newest part of the brain and the region responsible for higher functions like language—was roughly the same size two hundred thousand years ago as today. You are walking around with the same hardware as your Paleolithic ancestors.13\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,413\rthe last five hundred years or so—that society has shifted to a predominantly delayed-return environment.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,416\rThe world has changed much in recent years, but human nature has changed little.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,420\rAnd after thousands of generations in an immediate-return environment, our brains evolved to prefer quick payoffs to long-term ones.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,421\rBehavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency. That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time.fn2 You value the present more than the future.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,425\rWhy would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lung cancer? Why would someone overeat when they know it increases their\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,426\rrisk of obesity? Why would someone have unsafe sex if they know it can result in sexually transmitted disease?\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,427\rOnce you understand how the brain prioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: the consequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are immediate.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,431\rEvery habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately, these outcomes are often misaligned.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,434\r“It almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa ….18 Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.”\nPink highlight | Location: 2,440\rHowever, when the moment of decision arrives, instant gratification usually wins.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,446\rOur preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth about success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,450\rPeople who are better at delaying gratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, and superior social skills.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,456\rThankfully, it’s possible to train yourself to delay gratification—but you need to work with the grain of human nature, not\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,457\ragainst it. The best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,459\rThe vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful—even if it’s in a small way. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid off and that the work was worth the effort.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,466\rWhat we’re really talking about here—when we’re discussing immediate rewards—is the ending of a behavior. The ending of any experience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other\nPink highlight | Location: 2,468\rThe best approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,469\rHabit stacking, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start. Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,477\rThe immediate reward of seeing yourself save money toward the leather\nPink highlight | Location: 2,478\rjacket feels a lot better than being deprived. You are making it satisfying to do nothing.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,487\rEventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,492\rIn summary, a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. Simple bits of reinforcement—like soap that smells great or toothpaste that has a refreshing mint flavor or seeing $50 hit your savings account—can offer the immediate pleasure you need to enjoy a habit. And change is easy when it is enjoyable.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,496\r■ The 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying. ■ We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. ■ The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards. ■ The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated.

Genes have been shown to influence everything from the number of hours you spend watching television to your likelihood to marry or divorce to your tendency to get addicted to drugs, alcohol, or nicotine.8 There’s a strong genetic component to how obedient or rebellious you are when facing authority, how vulnerable or resistant you are to stressful events, how proactive or reactive you tend to be, and even how captivated or bored you feel during sensory experiences like attending a concert.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,835\rRobert Plomin,\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,835\rKing’s College in London, told me, “It is now at the point where we have stopped testing to see if traits have a genetic component because we literally can’t find a single one that isn’t influenced by our genes.”10\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,839\rThe most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,840\rOpenness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other. Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts). Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident,\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,850\rnatural antidepressant.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,852\rAs a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a personality trait all people possess to various degrees. People who are high in neuroticism tend to be anxious and worry more than others. This trait has been\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,853\rlinked to hypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain responsible for noticing threats.14 In other words, people who are more sensitive to negative cues in their environment are more likely to score high in neuroticism.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,872\rLearning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful. In theory, you can enjoy almost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the things that come easily to you. People who are talented in a particular area tend to be more competent at that task and are then praised for doing a good job. They stay energized because they are making progress where others have failed, and because they get rewarded with better pay and bigger opportunities, which not only makes them happier but also propels them to produce even higher-quality work. It’s a virtuous cycle.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,877\rPick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,878\rIn many cases, when people pick the wrong habit, it simply means they picked a habit that was too difficult.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,882\rThe most common approach is trial and error. Of course, there’s a problem with this strategy: life is short. You don’t have time to try every career, date every eligible bachelor, or play every musical instrument. Thankfully, there is an effective way to manage this conundrum, and it is known as the explore/exploit trade-off.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,885\ractivity, there should be a period of exploration. In relationships, it’s called dating. In college, it’s called the liberal arts. In business, it’s called split testing. The goal is to try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,890\rIn the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent. Google famously asks employees to spend 80 percent of the workweek on their official job and 20 percent on projects of their choice, which has led to the creation of\nPink highlight | Location: 2,892\rblockbuster products like AdWords and Gmail.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,897\rAs you explore different options, there are a series of questions you can ask yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you:\nPink highlight | Location: 2,899\rWhat feels like fun to me, but work to others? The mark of whether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most people.\nPink highlight | Location: 2,900\rWhen are you enjoying yourself while other\nPink highlight | Location: 2,900\rpeople are complaining? The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,901\rWhat makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades away.19 This blend of happiness and peak performance is what athletes and performers experience when they are “in the zone.” It is nearly impossible to experience a flow state and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,905\rWhere do I get greater returns than the average person? We are continually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a behavior is more likely to be satisfying when the comparison is in our favor. When I started writing at jamesclear.com, my email list grew very quickly. I wasn’t quite sure what I was doing well, but I knew that results seemed to be coming faster for me than\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,908\rfor some of my colleagues, which motivated me to keep writing.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,909\rWhat comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, “What feels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?” No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,913\rTo be honest, some of this process is just luck. Michael Phelps and Hicham El Guerrouj were lucky to be born with a rare set of abilities that are highly valued by society and to be placed in the ideal environment for those abilities.\nBlue highlight | Location: 2,916\rIf you can’t find a game where the odds are stacked in your favor, create one. Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, says, “Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort.20 In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.”\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,922\rWhen you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules.

Yes, it’s possible that the ripped trainer at the gym has better genes, but if you haven’t put in the same reps, it’s impossible to say if you have been dealt a better or worse genetic hand. Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.

This is an idea we covered in detail while discussing the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,003\rA flow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and fully immersed in an activity. Scientists have tried to quantify this feeling. They found that to achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current ability.5 In real life it’s typically not feasible to quantify the difficulty of an action in this way, but the core idea of the Goldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just manageable difficulty—something on the perimeter of your ability—seems crucial for maintaining motivation.\nBlue highlight | Location: 3,007\rImprovement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularly search for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make enough progress to stay motivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without variety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self-improvement.\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,015\rHe mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he said something I wasn’t expecting: “At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.”\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,017\rHis answer surprised me because it’s a different way of thinking about work ethic. People talk about getting “amped up” to work on their goals. Whether it’s business or sports or art, you hear people say things like, “It all comes down to passion.” Or, “You have to really want it.” As a result, many of us get depressed when we lose focus or motivation because we think that successful people have some bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was saying that\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,020\rreally successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,025\rThe greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us.\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,029\rAs Machiavelli noted, “Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.”\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,033\rIn psychology, this is known as a variable reward.7 fn2 Slot machines are the most common real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpot every now and then but not at any predictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. This variance leads to the greatest\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,036\rspike of dopamine, enhances memory recall, and accelerates habit formation.\nBlue highlight | Location: 3,037\rVariable rewards won’t create a craving—that is, you can’t take a reward people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval, and hope it will change their mind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings we already experience because they reduce boredom.\nBlue highlight | Location: 3,043\rOf course, not all habits have a variable reward component, and you wouldn’t want them to. If Google only delivered a useful search result some of the time, I would switch to a competitor pretty quickly. If Uber only picked up half of my trips, I doubt I’d be using that service much longer.\nBlue highlight | Location: 3,050\rI can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking to it, there will be days when you feel like quitting. When you start a business, there will be days when you don’t feel like showing up. When you’re at the gym, there will be sets that you don’t feel like finishing. When it’s time to write, there will be days that you don’t feel like typing. But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or draining to do so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur.\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,054\rProfessionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.\nYellow highlight | Location: 3,056\rDavid Cain, an author and meditation teacher, encourages his students to avoid being “fair-weather meditators.” Similarly, you don’t want to be a fair-weather athlete or a fair-weather writer or a fair-weather anything.\nBlue highlight | Location: 3,057\rWhen a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood.\nPink highlight | Location: 3,058\rProfessionals take action even when the mood isn’t right.\nPink highlight | Location: 3,060\rThere have been a lot of articles I haven’t felt like writing, but I’ve never regretted publishing on schedule. There have been a lot of days I’ve felt like relaxing, but I’ve never regretted showing up and working on something that was important to me. The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.\nPink highlight | Location: 3,065\rThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. ■ The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. ■ As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored. ■ Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference.\nPink highlight | Location: 3,071\rProfessionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.\nYour Kindle Notes For:\rStorynomics: Story-Driven Marketing in the Post-Advertising World\rRobert Mckee and Thomas Gerace\rLast accessed on Wednesday April 3, 2019\r564 Highlight(s) | 3 Note(s)\rYellow highlight | Location: 63\rI will hazard a prediction.

In the end, we are our choices. —Jeff Bezos, 2010 Princeton Commencement\nYellow highlight | Location: 71\rNow look ahead. Before long, all public and private communication—entertainment, news, music, sports, social media, online searches—will be ad-free, leaving sides of buses as the publicity medium of last resort.\nPink highlight | Location: 73\rMillennials, that vital under-forty market, are not only banishing advertising from their lives but sneering at the institution itself, denouncing its bragging and promising as deceitful, manipulative, the next thing to micro-aggression.\nPink highlight | Location: 79\rIn 2015, 76 percent of marketers surveyed by Adobe claimed that marketing had changed more in the last two years than it had in all the decades since the birth of television.\nBlue highlight | Location: 80\rMany chief marketing officers swear they will never again trust advertising to deliver customers. Some CMOs condemn ad agencies for wasting time and money trying to be Super Bowl–creative instead of market-effective. Others blame the noise from free online ads that drowns out their paid ads. Still others complain that falling return on investment (ROI) and rising costs make advertising just too damn expensive. Of course, if advertising suddenly redelivered the mass consumers of decades past, all would be forgiven.\nOrange highlight | Location: 84\rThe more the push strategies of bragging and promising lose traction, the more marketers turn to the pull tactics of effective storytelling.\nPink highlight | Location: 85\rTo support their efforts, the Harvard Business Review has published dozens of articles on the persuasive power of story for both leadership and branding, a myriad of TED talks have championed the neuroscience behind storified messaging, and how-to writers have poured out dozens upon dozens of story-in-business manuals that could fill a wall at Barnes \u0026amp; Noble.\nPink highlight | Location: 90\rbut overall, corporate storytelling continues to sputter and stumble in confusion, more a trend than a tool.\nPink highlight | Location: 92\rThe dream of story-driven commerce is still a dream.

The difference between data and story is this: Data lists what happened; story expresses how and why it happened.

Therefore, to persuade consumers, present your claims in a factual, logical, scientific manner.\nYellow highlight | Location: 293\rRhetoric imitates science by presenting evidence and drawing a conclusion, but the difference is that science weighs all evidence, both for and against a theorem; rhetoric slants its argument by laying out only the evidence that supports its claim,\nBlue highlight | Location: 295\rscience seeks the truth; rhetoric seeks the win.

Emotional Communication\nYellow highlight | Location: 330\rAt the heart of an effective creative philosophy is the belief that nothing is so powerful as an insight into human nature, what compulsions drive a man, what instincts dominate his action, even though his language so often camouflages what really motivates him. —Bill Bernbach\nBlue highlight | Location: 337\rAccording to one biography, Bernbach spoke to clients “. . . not of advertising, but the art of persuasion. To persuade the consumer, the creators of ads needed to touch people’s basic, unchanging instincts—their ‘obsessive drive to survive, to be admired, to succeed, to love, to take care of their own.’”4\nBlue highlight | Location: 340\rThe first step to mastering emotional manipulation is to realize that there are only two primary emotions, pleasure and pain.\nBlue highlight | Location: 348\rAs Paul Bloom, professor of psychology and behavioral science at Yale, explains in his book How Pleasure Works, “What matters most is not the world as it appears to our senses. Rather, the enjoyment (or suffering) we get from something derives from what we think that thing is.”7\nBlue highlight | Location: 351\rBloom claims that we are essentialists. Our response is conditioned by our beliefs of what things really are, what their essential nature is.8\nBlue highlight | Location: 357\rBut the Caltech study used an fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) device to observe the volunteers’ brain activity. The imaging revealed that when the participants drank what they believed to be a more expensive wine, the region of the brain linked to pleasure lit up.9 It wasn’t snobbery. They actually enjoyed greater\nBlue highlight | Location: 360\rpleasure from the wines they believed were more expensive.\nBlue highlight | Location: 365\rThe finding: Participants who believed they were shocked intentionally felt the shocks more painfully, and the pain lingered throughout the study. Those who believed that the shocks were unintentional experienced less pain and a quicker recovery.\nBlue highlight | Location: 367\rFor both pleasure and pain, the meaning of the perception, not the sensory experience alone, determines how much pleasure or pain people experience. Because pleasure and pain are great motivators, creating these experiences within an ad promised to be marketing’s most powerful tool.\nBlue highlight | Location: 369\rUnfortunately, however, this insight devolved into the techniques of seduction and coercion. Seduction entices someone to do something with the promise of pleasure; coercion persuades\nBlue highlight | Location: 370\rthem to act with the threat of pain.\nBlue highlight | Location: 377\rscreen. That’s why nearly two-thirds of millennials\nBlue highlight | Location: 380\rWhat’s left? If emotional manipulation angers people, and if rhetorical persuasion strikes them as BS, how can you connect with your customers? How can you solve your marketing crisis?\nBlue highlight | Location: 383\rWe advocate a solution that’s tens of thousands of years old, the mode of communication that best fits the mind, that best connects one mind with another, that wraps the clarity of a rational message inside an emotional package and delivers it with sticking power: story.\nBlue highlight | Location: 386\rEmotional because we empathize with its characters; meaningful because the actions of our protagonist deliver insights into human nature.\nBlue highlight | Location: 389\rMany assume that because they’ve seen and heard a lifetime\nBlue highlight | Location: 389\rof stories, they could easily create one. But that’s like thinking you can compose music because you’ve been to concerts.\nBlue highlight | Location: 392\rgreat stories have the power to change how humanity sees reality.\nBlue highlight | Location: 392\rStorified truths have built civilizations and religions that billions follow.\nBlue highlight | Location: 394\rcalled out\nBlue highlight | Location: 395\rthanks to storified marketing, innovative brands can tell stories that change how their consumers view the world, and blow past their competition when they do.\nYellow highlight | Location: 396\rIn short, story is the ultimate I.T. I in that storytelling demands information—a wide and deep knowledge of human nature and its relationship with the social and physical realms. T in that a well-told story demands skillful execution of its inner technology, its mechanisms of action/reaction, changing value charges, roles, conflicts, turning points, emotional dynamics, and much more. A craft underpins the art. Story structure, as we’ll see in the next chapter, is intrinsic to the human mind. Why then do we need to learn its craft? Isn’t storytelling natural? By the same token, children can sketch stick figures. Isn’t drawing also natural? Yes, both are, but to achieve excellence, authors and painters move beyond instinct to experiment and master their craft anew.\nYellow highlight | Location: 405\rIf you study story technique, you can learn to hook, hold, and reward your audience’s attention, as do the finest of films, plays, and novels.

But when the sense of I am separated self-awareness from its primal instincts, visions of a painful future streaked through the newly minted human mind.6 What’s more, the mind discovered that not only is the future in doubt, but the surfaces of people and things cannot be trusted; that nothing is what it seems.

As Kenneth Burke put it, story equips us to live.12 THE EIGHT POWERS\nPink highlight | Location: 498\rSelf-Awareness: The power to distinguish the mind’s subjective, core self from its objective, public self and observe the outer self as if it were a separate personality.\nPink highlight | Location: 507\rFor the storyteller, other-awareness guides the creation of the characters that make the choices and take the actions that carry out the story. 3. Memory: The power to store and recall experience.\nPink highlight | Location: 509\rThe past makes the future in this way: Memory builds an understanding of people and the world by recording patterns of experience, stacking them one on top of another by what they have in common, and then telling itself, “This is how the world works.”\nPink highlight | Location: 511\rThe mind then uses these patterns from the past in an effort to control the future by taking actions designed to make history repeat itself.\nBlue highlight | Location: 515\r4. Intelligence: The power to extract knowledge from both formal learning and everyday experience, and then apply deductive, inductive, and causal logics to reason to factual, truthful conclusions.\nBlue highlight | Location: 518\rImagination: The power to reshape reality into undreamed-of possibilities.\nBlue highlight | Location: 522\rInsight: The power to see through appearances and perceive inner causalities.\nBlue highlight | Location: 522\rAn insightful mind reads surface signs and then senses the hidden forces that move within and cause things to happen.\nOrange highlight | Location: 523\rData, for example, only measures the outer results of what has changed; insight discovers how and why what has changed has changed.\nBlue highlight | Location: 524\rThe storyteller, as we will see, uses this keen perspective to show us a world we think we understand, but then cracks open reality to first surprise us, then deliver a rush of insight into the hows and whys of that world and its characters. A lifetime of story-driven insights civilizes human beings, builds institutions, and makes culture viable.\nPink highlight | Location: 527\rCorrelation: The power to create. The correlating mind takes two things it already knows, and then seeks a hidden connection, a third thing that joins the two in a way no one else has ever seen before.\nPink highlight | Location: 533\rSelf-Expression: The power to perform.\nPink highlight | Location: 540\rThe mind builds stories to bridge the gap between itself and the universe, between itself and the past, present, and future.\nPink highlight | Location: 541\rStory form imposes order on chaos;\nPink highlight | Location: 541\rseems to express the cause and effect of the is; it unifies events to\nPink highlight | Location: 542\rKnowledge expressed in story form gathers other human beings around its themes, uniting communities and building cultures.\nBlue highlight | Location: 543\rSo, in the marketing context, the takeaway is this: Storified communication is the most powerful form of messaging because story fits the mind; story fits the mind because the mind converts actuality into story in the first place. It’s a tautology. As Hamlet says, “There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.”\nPink highlight | Location: 553\rStory, like art and music, is a word you think you understand until you try to define it.\nPink highlight | Location: 556\rReference books offer little help.\nPink highlight | Location: 561\rLet’s clarify what story is by first looking at what it is not and eliminating any weak synonyms or false equivalents.\nPink highlight | Location: 562\rSTORY IS NOT A PROCESS\nPink highlight | Location: 565\rBut unlike a story, a process has neither a desire nor a conflict nor a core character. As a result, no one’s life is touched or changed. A process accumulates; a story progresses.\nPink highlight | Location: 566\rSTORY IS NOT A HIERARCHY\nPink highlight | Location: 568\rFor them, the corporate “story” describes how things get done, how decisions and tasks flow up and down the pyramid of power.\nPink highlight | Location: 570\rSTORY IS NOT A CHRONOLOGY\nPink highlight | Location: 573\rSTORY IS NOT A JOURNEY\nPink highlight | Location: 573\rThe buzzword journey is a fashionable false metaphor for “life story.”\nBlue highlight | Location: 577\rsociety. But the protagonist of a well-told story is not a passive passenger; she struggles dynamically through\nBlue highlight | Location: 577\rtime and space to fulfill her desire.\nBlue highlight | Location: 578\rSTORY IS NOT A NARRATIVE\nBlue highlight | Location: 578\rMany marketing campaigns have flopped because an ad agency didn’t know the difference between narrative and story.\nBlue highlight | Location: 581\rAll stories are narratives, but not all narratives are stories.\nBlue highlight | Location: 581\rNarratives tend to be flat, bland, repetitive, and boring recitations of events.\nPink highlight | Location: 582\rThey slide through the mind like juice through a goose, and as a result, they have little or no influence on customers.\nYellow highlight | Location: 583\rStories, on the other hand, are value-charged and progressive. The mind embraces a well-told story; the imagination is its natural home. Once through our mental door, story fits, sticks, and excites consumer choice. The next time you’re bored to the bone by somebody’s “story,” in all likelihood you’re not being told a story. If you were, you’d be listening and engrossed. Instead the guy is torturing you with a narrative, probably a repetitious recitation of “. . . and then I did this and then I did that and then I did the other thing and then and then and then…”\nYellow highlight | Location: 588\rWhat is a story, precisely? The essential core event in all stories ever told in the history of humanity can be expressed in just three words: Conflict changes life. Therefore, the prime definition becomes: a dynamic escalation of conflict-driven events that cause meaningful change in a character’s life.\nYellow highlight | Location: 599\rAs with the arts of music and dance, the primary dimension of a story is time.\nYellow highlight | Location: 604\rBefore an author composes his story, he needs a clear vision of his audience and the final effect his work will have on both their thoughts and feelings.\nYellow highlight | Location: 607\rthe specific rational effect the storytellers aimed for was a deep understanding of the hows and whys behind the events.\nYellow highlight | Location: 608\rTheir specific target of meaningful emotional satisfaction was the calm sense of gratification that comes when a quiet hero beats the odds\nYellow highlight | Location: 609\rfrom behind the scenes.\nYellow highlight | Location: 609\rSTAGE TWO: SUBJECT MATTER PRIME PRINCIPLE: BALANCE A story takes place at a specific time in a specific physical and social world.

In the practical world of business, the brevity of advertising time, along with the high costs of creatives and production, confines marketing stories to one or two turning points. MEANING\nBlue highlight | Location: 682\rFirst, at the core of all stories pulses at least one binary value—such as life/death, freedom/tyranny, success/failure, truth/lie, love/hate, and the like.\nBlue highlight | Location: 686\rSecond, the dynamic of cause and effect within the story’s events expresses the hows and whys,\nOrange highlight | Location: 700\rWriters of fiction for page, stage, and screen have little difficulty imagining their story’s buying public.\nBlue highlight | Location: 703\rAt the end of the day, the professional writer judges his quality of work not by its effect on him, but by the degree to which the effect he hoped for affects his readers or audience.\nYellow highlight | Location: 708\rSubject matter for a story contains three major components: a physical and social setting, a protagonist, and a core value. Life offers the storyteller an infinite variety of each.\nOrange highlight | Location: 710\rIn fact, more often than not, the spark of originality that ignites an exceptional story flashes through a creative’s imagination not while she daydreams, but as she sweats out the grunt work of founding her story-world and planting its setups.\nPink highlight | Location: 712\rWorld-building, therefore, is storytelling’s critical second step.\nBlue highlight | Location: 713\rThe weakest choices of all favor the general over the specific.\nBlue highlight | Location: 716\rThe mind works best when it moves from the specific to the universal—not the other way around. Consider, for example, the phrase a piece of furniture.\nNote:Important\nPink highlight | Location: 718\rparticular. But if I say, “A wingback Duchess chair upholstered in blood-red leather,” a clear image glows in your mind. Instinctively, your imagination moves forward from this particular to the general, slotting the chair into the mental category “furniture.” This applies to all aspects of a story’s world, physical and social.\nBlue highlight | Location: 720\rTherefore, the principle: The more specific the setting, the more universal the story’s appeal.\nBlue highlight | Location: 731\r(1) Physical—the horizontal landscape and every object on it. (2) Social—the vertical hierarchy of a society’s pyramid of power and the possibility for movement up or down.\nBlue highlight | Location: 736\rEvery physical setting contains a social setting as well, a cast of characters defined by demographic factors such as age, gender, income, employment, and ethnicity. What’s more, this cast lives in a culture defined first and foremost by its values—its ideality versus its reality, what its citizens believe they should do versus what in fact they do.\nBlue highlight | Location: 739\rTHE CORE VALUE\nBlue highlight | Location: 743\rBut for the story-maker, the values he invests in his telling come not as singularities but binaries of positive/negative charge: truth/lie, love/hate, generosity/selfishness, hard work/laziness, loyalty/betrayal, life/death, courage/cowardice, hope/despair, meaningfulness/meaninglessness, maturity/immaturity, justice/injustice, and on the list goes, naming all those qualities of\nBlue highlight | Location: 745\rhuman experience that can shift charge dynamically from positive to negative and back again.\nBlue highlight | Location: 747\rbut it anchors its content in one irreplaceable binary—the story’s core value. This value determines a story’s fundamental meaning and emotion.\nBlue highlight | Location: 754\rThe core value that pulses at the heart of a story determines its specific meaning and unique emotional impact.\nBlue highlight | Location: 761\rA core character must be empathetic; she or he may or may not be sympathetic.\nBlue highlight | Location: 763\rEmpathetic means “like me”—an innate trait shared by both the core character and the target audience.\nBlue highlight | Location: 764\rSympathy is optional, empathy essential, for this reason: Audience involvement hinges on an act of personal identification.\nBlue highlight | Location: 765\rRather, the psychological bond of empathy only develops when an audience subconsciously identifies with a positive human quality emanating from within the character. This quality becomes the story’s center of good.\nPink highlight | Location: 768\rThe moment a story appears in front of audience members or readers, they instantly and instinctively inspect its value-charged landscape, seeking an emotional door into the story, a place to stick their empathy. They sort the positives from the negatives, the goods from the bads, the rights from the wrongs, the things of value from the things of no value. Everyone searches for a center of good because, in his heart of hearts, everyone instinctively sees himself as good.\nBlue highlight | Location: 773\rTherefore, all people, regardless of their humanity or lack of it, seek a positive glow somewhere in a story’s world, a mooring for their empathy.\nBlue highlight | Location: 774\rIdeally, the storyteller places this center of good within the protagonist so that a positive human quality emanates from within the core character and captures the audience’s personal involvement. This empathy magnet also anchors the mirror story, which we will explain in\nBlue highlight | Location: 779\rBefore a story begins, its physical setting, social setting, core value, and core character rest in a state of balance.\nPink highlight | Location: 791\rFirst, it captures\nBlue highlight | Location: 792\rAs we pointed out earlier, the mind keys on change, and the inciting incident’s sudden pivot of the protagonist’s life sharply focuses the audience’s interest.\nBlue highlight | Location: 794\rWhen you think back, how many perfectly lousy stories have you sat through for no other reason than to get the answer to the nagging question: “How does this piece of dreck turn out?”\nPink highlight | Location: 795\rThird, when curiosity over the MDQ merges with empathy for the protagonist, a story generates the compelling magnetism known as suspense. Suspense doubles involvement. This blend of subjective identification with objective wonder magnifies a story’s power tenfold.\nPink highlight | Location: 804\rthe inciting incident arouses the natural human desire to regain control and restore balance.\nPink highlight | Location: 806\rand so conceives of an object of desire,\nPink highlight | Location: 806\rThis could be something physical like a hike in pay, a product innovation, or the right person\nPink highlight | Location: 809\rNonetheless, all stories dramatize the essential human struggle to move life from chaos to order, from imbalance to equilibrium.\nYellow highlight | Location: 810\rWe measure the worth of the object of desire in terms of risk: the greater the risk, the greater the object’s worth. What would you risk your time for? What would you risk your life for? What would you risk your soul for? The most compelling objects of desire come with the highest price tags, and the greater the object’s worth, the greater the involvement. Contrariwise, watching a character pursue something of no real value is the definition of boredom.\nYellow highlight | Location: 815\rstorytelling becomes the art of merging and organizing many streams of want into a flow of events that aims at a single object of desire.\nYellow highlight | Location: 823\rThese desires not only cement the status quo of a character’s life but also temper his behavior. Background desires form the web of restraints that follow every character into every scene. These fixed desires for stability limit the character’s actions, restraining what he may or may not say or do to get what he wants.\nYellow highlight | Location: 826\rDesire answers what questions: What does the character consciously want? What does he subconsciously long for? Motivation answers why questions. Why does a character want what he wants? Why does he want his particular object of desire?\nPink highlight | Location: 828\rThe roots of human motivation reach deep into childhood and, for that reason, are often irrational.\nPink highlight | Location: 830\rBiographers of historical figures—Charles Darwin, Eleanor Roosevelt, Picasso—devote chapter upon chapter detailing the upbringing of each, trying to\nPink highlight | Location: 831\rdocument the precise childhood experiences that motivated these personages to do the great things they did.\nOrange highlight | Location: 832\rShakespeare, on the other hand, never mentions motivation.\nBlue highlight | Location: 834\rSTAGE FIVE: THE FIRST ACTION PRIME PRINCIPLE: TACTICAL CHOICE\nBlue highlight | Location: 835\rDesire demands deeds.\nYellow highlight | Location: 836\rThis positive/negative dynamic propels his story to climax.\nYellow highlight | Location: 838\rEvery human being acts from one moment to the next on his personal sense of probability, on what he feels will probably happen when he does what he intends to do next.\nYellow highlight | Location: 843\rFrom his quiver of personal tactics, he draws strategic behaviors, all in an effort to move toward his desire of the moment and long-term hopes.\nYellow highlight | Location: 844\rAnd because, like everyone else, he is one of a kind, his sense of what will probably happen when he takes an action will also be one of a kind; therefore, his choice of tactic (exact words, gestures, facial expressions, and so on) will, in turn, be one of a kind.\nYellow highlight | Location: 847\rIt’s this infinitude of idiosyncratic tactics that inspires storytellers to imagine unique characters, the sort found in the best-told stories, with behaviors like no one else’s, behaviors that fascinate.\nYellow highlight | Location: 849\rEvolution programmed the genes of every living thing to conserve life down to the last calorie of energy, take no uncalled-for risks, and yet pursue all necessary desires. Therefore, human nature, as a part of Mother Nature, always takes the conservative, minimal, and yet sufficient action in an effort to get what it wants.\nBlue highlight | Location: 853\rA character will never do less than she has to, nor will she ever do more than she needs to; instead, she will take the minimal, conservative, yet sufficient action that she believes will move her closer to a balanced life.\nBlue highlight | Location: 856\rNinety-nine percent of our actions cause the responses we more or less expect.\nBlue highlight | Location: 859\rTo create a meaningful emotional experience for his audience, the storyteller evicts all empty moments, all trivialities and banalities, and embraces those events, and only those events, that bring value-charged change.\nBlue highlight | Location: 860\rTo create value-charged change, the storyteller pits the core character’s sense of probability against reality’s forces of necessity.\nBlue highlight | Location: 867\rWhen a character’s world suddenly reacts differently and/or more powerfully than he imagined, this violation of expectation delivers a jolt of surprise, followed by a rush of insight. The clash between what he thinks will happen and the result he actually gets jolts him and splits open his reality.\nBlue highlight | Location: 869\rThe character stares, as it were, into the gap between his subjective anticipation and its objective result. Then with a rush of insight, he suddenly glimpses how his world actually works; how its unforeseen forces of antagonism now block his path.\nBlue highlight | Location: 873\rWhen an unanticipated, even contradictory, obstacle violates a protagonist’s expectations, it moves him farther from his object of desire than he was before he acted.\nBlue highlight | Location: 887\rInner Obstacles: Contradictory forces within a character’s body, emotions, and mind with its warring conscious and subconscious desires.\nBlue highlight | Location: 891\rTo turn a scene means to change its value charge; the phrase turning point names the precise moment when an unforeseen force of antagonism violates expectations and pivots the value at stake from positive to negative or negative to positive.\nBlue highlight | Location: 893\rTurning points trigger change in only one of two ways—either by a direct action followed by the reaction it sparks, or by a revelation of a secret or previously unknown fact and the response it unleashes.\nYellow highlight | Location: 898\rThe Rational Effects of TURNING POINTS A violation of expectation is, in essence, an effect with an unknown cause. As a result, turning points pop questions into the mind such as “Why have things taken this unforeseen turn? Why didn’t the character see this coming? Why didn’t I? What caused this startling twist?”\nYellow highlight | Location: 901\rA turning point punches a hole in reality. Curiosity\nYellow highlight | Location: 901\rcompels the audience members to fill the hole with knowledge, so their thoughts rush back through previous scenes and images, looking for an unseen cause, trying to solve the mystery of “Why?” The answer has been planted beneath the story’s setups. The moment the audience glimpses this hidden truth, it erupts with an “Oh, yeah, now I get it!” insight that both delights and enlightens.\nYellow highlight | Location: 911\rAs Aristotle observed, the deepest audience pleasure is learning without being taught. When a tale dramatizes its meaning skillfully, the audience feels no mental strain and yet comes away with a fuller understanding of the workings of the world and the human heart.\nYellow highlight | Location: 916\rthe like. The mind’s ranking process keys on the potential for change. So long as life’s conditions run in neutral, the mind pays no attention and goes about its many tasks. But when things change, awareness snaps to alert as our animal instincts warn us that change threatens survival.\nYellow highlight | Location: 922\rEmotion, therefore, is the side effect of change. When the mind senses change from negative to positive, it releases pleasure-giving chemicals; if the mind registers a movement from positive to negative, it unleashes a painful flow.\nYellow highlight | Location: 926\rAd Age named “Real Beauty” one of the top five ad campaigns of the century.\nYellow highlight | Location: 928\rIn 2013, Hugo Veiga created a video titled Dove Real Beauty Sketches.2 The story follows a group of women who volunteer for an odd experiment: They agree to have their portrait done by a sketch artist who cannot see them. Instead they will simply tell him what they look like. This act of courage immediately draws empathy from the audience.\nYellow highlight | Location: 936\rThe above graphic tracks the emotional dynamics in the Dove Real Beauty Sketches video. Its turning points swivel between the opposing poles of its core value, from self-criticism to self-appreciation.\nBlue highlight | Location: 946\rThe story climaxes on the doubly positive charge of self-appreciation. During this decisive transition, the audience shares in the women’s triumph over self-criticism and feels, with them, a positive emotion.\nBlue highlight | Location: 948\rAll well-told stories express how and why life changes, and, as we noted above,\nOrange highlight | Location: 948\rthe side effect of change is emotion.\nBlue highlight | Location: 949\rThese feelings, however, only come to life during a transition. As a story shifts from positive to negative, the audience feels a dark emotion; as it transitions from negative to positive, a light emotion fills them. Once change completes itself, however, emotion quickly dissipates, ready to move in a new direction. To grip and hold emotional involvement, a story’s values must transition dynamically from change to change to change.\nBlue highlight | Location: 957\rFaced with an array of possible actions, she must choose one last tactic in a final effort to put life back in balance.\nBlue highlight | Location: 958\rDecisions come in two kinds: clear choices versus dilemmas—the easy versus the hard.\nBlue highlight | Location: 960\rClear choices obey nature’s grand imperative: Always choose the positive.\nBlue highlight | Location: 961\rEvery living thing, flora and fauna, instinctively heeds the two laws governing the conservation of energy and life: (1) Never do anything you don’t have to do if you can get what you want the easier way. (2) Never take any risk you don’t have to take if you can get what you want the safer way.\nBlue highlight | Location: 968\rDilemmas also come in two kinds, and both are hard because they pose a choice between either two positives or two negatives, known respectively as irreconcilable goods and the lesser of two evils.\nBlue highlight | Location: 972\rThe hard choice of dilemma causes anxiety before the choice and risk during it.\nBlue highlight | Location: 975\rBut as we’ll see in the next chapter, in the marketer’s purpose-told story, the protagonist’s climactic choice must be pressure-and stress-free.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,013\rUnlike full-length fictions, purpose-told stories abbreviate events. The typical business story is a mini-tale told in a thirty-second commercial or a three-minute YouTube video. GE’s “Owen” ads and the Dove Real Beauty Sketches are two perfect examples of each.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,016\rThe marketing story, no. Purpose-told works crack open the gap between expectation and result usually only once, perhaps twice, maybe three times at the most.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,028\rThe purpose-told’s audience members take their storified experience into the real world and relive it each and every time they purchase the subject product or service. In other words, the purpose of the purpose-told story is to transform the aesthetic pleasure of a story’s climax into a viable action in the marketplace—to turn audiences into consumers.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,032\rwe gain an insight into life we never knew before, all enveloped in emotions we never felt quite that way before. This fusion of idea and emotion adds a measure of enrichment, great or small, to our inner life. We exit a beautifully told story a fuller human being than when we entered.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,035\rThe fiction-told story fulfills itself in one telling, whereas the purpose-told story retells its tale in the mind of the consumer each and every time she buys its product or hires its service.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,038\rConcentrated experiences entertain because they carry us through time unaware of the passage of time.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,047\rThe audience of the purpose-told story, on the other hand, ignores the artist and feels brand loyalty instead. Brand loyalty, and the lifetime of purchases that comes with it, is created by the mirror experience at the heart of the purpose-told story. THE MIRROR EXPERIENCE Well-told stories create two simultaneous experiences that mirror each other: one mental, the other emotional. The mental mirror experience begins and ends with curiosity. A story’s inciting incident teases the audience’s mind with unanswered questions such as “What’s going to happen next? What’ll happen after that? How will this story turn out? Will the protagonist win his object of desire?” The rational mirror experience in story mirrors the same set\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,059\rFirst, the identification. The moment the target consumer recognizes a shared humanity between herself and the protagonist, her instincts follow the logic of kinship: “That character is a human being like me. Therefore, I want that character to get what he wants, because if I were that character in that situation, I would want the same thing for myself.” In other words, she bonds.2\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,065\rShe instinctively experiences the events as if they were happening to her.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,067\rThird, the reenactment. The consumer’s mirror experience motivates her to act. Wishing to relive the positive charge of the purpose-told story, she purchases the product or hires the service embedded in the telling. Her post-story reenactment satisfies her need and the marketer’s purpose simultaneously. In short, she becomes a customer.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,074\rThe mind memorizes the patterns of cause and effect that underlie real-life past events so it can strategize its future actions. As events impact us over the years, we gather knowledge of how things work, how the various forces in our world interconnect. When new situations arise, the mind draws on these past patterns to imagine the possible tactics it might take and predict the probable reactions these actions might cause.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,077\rThis process of linking previous encounters to future outcomes underlies not only factual but also fictional experience.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,082\rEach person acts on her unique sense of probability, what her sum total of personal experience, actual and fictional, tells her will probably happen when she chooses to act.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,088\rThe arc of the purpose-told story guides the consumer from an absence in her life to its fulfillment, from need to satisfaction.

As we demonstrated in the emotion-creation section of the previous chapter, this insight into the target audience’s inciting incident and resulting object of desire inspired Ogilvy \u0026amp; Mather to weave a purpose-told story around the core value of self-criticism versus self-appreciation.

If so, the tale must be told from that point of view. To do so, however, the storyteller faces this challenging problem: How can I fuse an empathetic connection between consumer and protagonist when the latter is either an inanimate object or an impersonal institution?\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,168\rFantasy worlds and characters demand imagination, innovation, and creative execution. Rather than face that task, many campaigns abandon storytelling in favor of a spokesperson bragging and making promises the product’s performance may or may not be able to keep.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,172\rTo turn a corporation into an empathetic protagonist, the marketer first must identify the company’s primal value, a value so essential to its nature that if it were lost, the company would disappear with it.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,177\rAlways bear in mind that the center of good expresses itself in action, not association.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,182\rEach person draws her personal identity from the culture that surrounds her.

In short, the essence of reality is humanity’s ongoing strivings against negation.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,310\rMarketing stories move from problem to solution, not solution to solution to solution. A positive climax demands a negative setup. For no matter how happy a happy ending may be, if nothing but uplifting scenes precede it, redundancy erases those images from the audience’s memory.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,312\rThe more often a cause repeats, the less and less its effect. Repetition kills impact.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,315\rThe first piece of cheesecake tastes great; the second seems hard to swallow; the third makes you sick. The same pattern applies to story design.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,316\rvacuity. Why do so many branding campaigns devolve into boring recitations of… and then and then and then…?\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,317\rWhy do so many product and service ads deliver little, if any, impact? Answer: because their tellings deliberately avoid any hint of conflict. And why is that? Answer: negaphobia.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,319\rNegaphobia is a by-product of marketing education. Ever since the invention of the business school, and marketing as a unique discipline within its curriculum, marketers have been trained, as the old song goes, to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,323\rToday, for example, the worst thing one employee might say about another is: “He’s so negative.”\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,323\rall probability, the guy in question is simply a realist who sees things as they are, downsides and all, but from cubicle to cubicle, those who cannot face the sharp edges of reality tend to shun those who can.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,327\rFirst: as mentioned, the business school dictum to protect your brand from any and all criticism. Second: the super-sensitive people of today’s hyper-protective culture who find unpleasant truths intimidating. Third: people who want to cover their asses.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,332\rTo preempt blame, marketing executives cover their butts by outlawing the least hint of anything negative in their ads. As an unfortunate result, negaphobia not only distorts their business judgment, but also sucks the impact out of their messaging.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,334\rA compelling marketing story encompasses the negative of life.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,335\rAnd the story must establish its negative floor either in Stage Two, when the inciting incident imbalances the protagonist’s life, or here in Stage Six as the story’s forces of antagonism suddenly react against the protagonist.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,336\rThis surprise instantly pops the question “Why?” into the mind of character and audience alike. Curiosity drives them to look more deeply into the story’s society and setting.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,338\rexperience a rush of insight into the true forces that oppose the protagonist’s desire and how his world actually works.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,339\rConsumers love to realize the truth in this spontaneous, storified way. They want to be shown, not told. They don’t want to sit in a classroom; they want a surprising living discovery.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,340\rThis insight puts the consumer’s mirror story on a path to solution and the satisfaction of her need. She doesn’t know how it will be done, but it’s out there, so she can’t look away. This curiosity holds your prospect’s attention, even in a world of constant distraction. Marketing stories are generally brief. The protagonist pursues her object of desire through usually only one turning point.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,348\rStage Seven brings the story to its crisis, the highest level of tension and suspense. The protagonist, based on her new knowledge, chooses a new tactic, one she hopes will create a reaction from her world that will deliver her object of desire.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,350\rAt this point in most fiction-told stories, the protagonist stands in dilemma, forced to choose between either two irreconcilable positive possibilities or two equally repugnant negative choices. Never in a marketing story. Rather, the insight the protagonist gained in Stage Six now gives her a clear choice of what to do to get what she wants. She conceives her new tactic and takes it.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,354\r“How will this turn out?”\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,358\rStage Eight delivers the goods. The protagonist’s second action evokes a positive reaction from his world, giving him his object of desire and reestablishing the balance of his life.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,360\rbut also dramatizes how they can solve the mirror problem in their own lives—how they, too, can get what they need and desire.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,370\r“December 21st” ends with a final twist. Before the son can break the truth to the grandmother, she stops him, saying, “I know what you are going to say.” He sighs, thinking she has already figured it out and been let down. Instead she reaches into her pocket and hands him her “winning” lottery ticket, saying, “But you should always listen to your mother. And I will be much happier if you have this.”\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,378\rA story’s climax impacts the audience’s mind with a sudden rush of meaningful emotional insight, a flash of “I get it!”\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,380\rNeuroscientists have measured this open-mind phenomenon and found that it lasts for six to eight seconds.\nNote:Neuroscience of getting the story\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,380\rIn this moment of wonder and pleasure, anything presented to the mind lodges in its memory. Therefore, this is the spot where the wise marketer plants his logo.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,382\rThat’s exactly what the Spanish lottery does at the end of their five-minute story, and beneath it they feature their tagline “There’s no bigger prize than sharing.”\nPink highlight | Location: 1,384\rThe final effect of the open-mind moment turns the entire story into a massive call to action that sends the audience member out into the real world to duplicate the protagonist’s triumph. Wanting to relive the mirror story, she purchases the product or hires the service that’s at the heart of the story.\nPink highlight | Location: 1,387\rNow that we have reviewed the eight stages of story, it’s important to note that not every marketing story needs to take its audience through all eight stages explicitly. The mind, as we noted, is a story-taking and -making machine.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,388\rOne key phrase or image may imply an entire story, as the audience’s mind instantly imagines the unexpressed stages.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,389\rConsider, for example, Nike’s famous imperative: “Just Do It.” What story do those three words imply? It goes like this:\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,394\rA story doesn’t even need words. Take for example, the famous Michelin advertisement, featuring this image:\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,401\rWhen told beautifully, a little goes a long way.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,420\rWell, I’m no Steve Jobs… but I also think the two essential roles of the marketer are conducting the corporate orchestra and setting the North Star vision…\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,424\rToday the CMO occupies a new, critical, and far broader role in the company than ever before: change agent. THE CMO AS CHANGE AGENT\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,428\rYour first task as change agent is to educate your executive team on the worldwide shift from ad-centric to story-centric marketing. No small task. Conventional C-suite wisdom holds that six-year-olds crave stories, while hard-charging executives don’t. But you know that if your company doesn’t change its MO, it won’t survive, so you must build a winning case to convince the C-suite.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,434\rOnce your executives are on board with the concept, teach the eight stages of story creation to sales, marketing, product development, communications, investor relations, and leadership at all corporate levels. Finally, to put storytelling into practice, coach your team to change their thinking habits in six decisive ways:\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,437\rChange your team’s analytical method from deductive logic to causal logic.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,445\rChange the team’s sales practices from additive to progressive.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,453\rChange the team’s worldview from narrow and shallow to wide and deep.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,457\rDove’s “Real Beauty” stories drive their campaign by foregrounding the inner conflict of self-criticism versus self-appreciation.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,460\rstory. Train your teams to work through all levels of antagonism so they can craft stories that resonate with the consumer.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,462\rChange your team’s understanding of values. Convincing storytelling depends on an authenticity of values. Therefore, a transformational\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,468\rChange your team’s marketing theory to embrace emotional intelligence.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,470\rThe key to decision making is emotion, and emotion is not information. The emotionally targeted question you should ask is: “How do I want my customers to feel?”\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,472\rYour team members must frame their stories to create a feeling of fusion between protagonist and audience. When empathy seals the deal, use progressive conflict and value charge changes to hook and hold your audience, and finally reward it with a story climax that reinforces brand or product values.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,474\rChange the team’s mental model from static description to dynamic storytelling.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,481\rAs corporate showrunner, the modern CMO educates her team in story craft, produces a storytelling strategy for the brand, and operationalizes its storytelling processes.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,482\rShe recruits the right creatives, guides moment-by-moment storytelling to ensure brand/voice alignment, and exercises good taste to guarantee a quality experience for the brand’s prospective customers. It’s a big job.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,487\rEvery CMO starts his day staring at this hard truth: Nobody wants to hear about your company or your product.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,491\rTypically, consumers only debate brands in the mental minute just before they make a purchase. That precious minute makes storified branding an imperative for modern marketing.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,500\rBrand is a single organizing idea, a higher-order construct that everything else comes from and aligns with. Sometimes I liken it to the fresh water that makes everything else possible, whether that is growing your crops or cleaning your clothes or making soup. It’s that ingredient that goes across everything else.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,503\rFinding a fresh source of water that won’t be depleted and can be used in hundreds and hundreds of ways is a challenge. Which is to say [brand] is intangible, it is abstract, and it is true. It has to be all of those things at\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,505\rThe job of the marketer is to make it tangible and real and to work with its truth to tell a story that is compelling whether it happens in one image or three lines or a long-form piece.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,506\rAll of that is in service of saying we want brands to be a link between a number of positive associations for the consumer, and increasingly for communities and constituencies beyond the consumer, to say that we can all come together around this one big higher-order idea.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,508\rIt is a belief system, and like any belief system, it has its language, it has symbols, it has rituals, and behaviors to go with them.1\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,512\rThose brands are all owned by the same company, and in fact, consumers may choose those brands at different points in their weekend, because they are conveying different aspects of their personality with that badge, with the beer bottle they are holding.” The brands we choose reflect how we see ourselves or, perhaps, how we want the world to see us.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,514\rOriginally, Davis pointed out, brands were simply a means of identifying the producer.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,515\rThe purpose of the brand was to show that a certain person had made that specific piece. Whether silver goods or porcelain or leather goods, wares were hallmarked by their maker (in effect, they were branded like cattle).\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,518\r“The mark is just a shortcut, a signal for [the brand]. [The brand] still exists and survives beyond the product and beyond the mark and that’s when you get into some very interesting work.”\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,519\rHow can you create a brand that matters so much to people that they make it part of their self-expression? For generations, television advertising did the trick. Not anymore. To connect with audiences today, we need a different approach. And it had better be good, because we’ve got a steep hill to climb.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,530\rlawsuits related to the scandal were finally settled, the number of affected\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,546\rUS District Judge Carl Barbier found that “BP’s negligent acts that caused the blowout, explosion and oil spill… were profit-driven decisions.” He concluded, “These instances of negligence, taken together, evidence an extreme deviation from the standard of care and a conscious disregard of known risks.”\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,554\rThe willingness of these companies to put profits above the well-being of their customers, their neighbors, and the environment has not just damaged their individual reputations. It has damaged the perception of businesses in general.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,557\rWhat’s more, they believe the problem begins at the top: Just 37 percent of those surveyed find CEOs to be credible.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,561\rSick of being fooled, people assume that the phrase for profit means “at any cost,” even the possibility of harm to the consumer.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,562\rOvercoming skepticism is like overcoming gravity. It’s a natural force, buttressed by the endless bragging and over-promising of brands.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,564\rThe well-told story erases skepticism by wrapping the story’s meaning inside an emotion.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,565\rThe source of this psychological power is empathic identification.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,565\rOnce an audience instinctively links its sense of self with a protagonist, doubt vanishes. The protagonist’s choices and actions become the audience’s vicarious choices and actions.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,568\rLike an epiphany, a story’s climactic action floods the mind with a sense of truth.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,569\rBecause the audience member’s own thoughts spontaneously form this idea, she believes in it without rationalization or any hint of skepticism. It’s hers, after all. What’s more, the pleasure-filled emotion aroused by this sudden insight engraves the experience into her memory. From that day on, her upbeat remembrance surrounds the brand with a subliminal halo that influences her purchases. This is how stories, consistently told well, establish a meaningful brand in the minds of\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,572\rconsumers.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,573\rOnce you determine your audience (Stage One of the storytelling process), you must choose subject matter that contains a physical and social setting, a core value, and a protagonist (Stage Two). Subject matter possibilities for brands fall into at least five grand genres: origin, history, mission, product, and customer stories. You need a least one story to define your brand, but some brands tell thousands.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,585\rOnce again, empathy. Genius-in-a-garage stories are as old as Thomas Edison. They touch the heart because they star the iconic American business hero: a young shoestring entrepreneur battling shortsighted prejudice and overwhelming odds.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,586\rIf your company has a powerful origin story, and the core value of that story aligns with your brand’s, make it the first story you tell to establish your brand in the minds of your consumers.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,588\rIn truth, however, successful businesses rarely begin with action movie heroism. They take root in three things: a good idea, hard work, and persistence.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,591\rAs we pointed out in chapter 4, stories progress with emotional dynamics; narratives repeat emotionless facts. Consider, for example, the Coca-Cola website piece titled\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,593\r“125 Years of Sharing Happiness.”13 It makes a grand promise…\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,594\rThis is the remarkable story about the evolution of an iconic brand and the company that bears its name. Since its birth at a soda fountain in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, in 1886, Coca-Cola has been a catalyst for social interaction and inspired innovation. These unique moments in history, arranged in chronological sequence, have helped create a global brand that provides billions of moments of refreshment every day.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,613\rEver since Hurricane Katrina in September 2005, when a disaster,\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,629\rThe ad cleverly linked the ubiquitous IBM business computers to the Orwellian society from the novel 1984, in which all decisions were controlled from on high.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,633\rIt was a powerful statement, one that resonated deeply with an America in the midst of the Cold War, facing the Soviet Union’s totalitarian regime.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,635\rThe same core value of rebellion versus submission resonates in Apple’s trademark. It’s not an apple, Patrick Davis pointed out, it’s an apple with a bite taken out of it. That image retells the foundational story of Judeo-Christian heritage. The first bite from the tree of knowledge celebrates humankind’s greatest act of rebellion.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,642\rRed Bull’s market researchers first discovered that their die-hard customer is a young guy who loves extreme sports. Digging deeper, the executives asked, “What do our customers want to feel?” The answer came back: “Frenetic energy.” This insight led to their discovery of the brand’s core value: excitement/boredom. The next logical step was to tell online consumer-centric stories that couple powerful writing with original pulse-pounding film to dynamically dramatize the company’s core value from the consumer’s point of view.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,651\rThis is why when you visit Red Bull’s website, you won’t find a picture of a Red Bull can or any bragging about its contents. Why? Because Red Bull recognizes that its typical fifteen-to twenty-five-year-old male customer doesn’t\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,654\rThe marketers know that if a guy who’s watched RedBull.tv sees a choice between Red Bull and a competitor, he will recall the edge-of-his-seat emotion their storytelling pocketed in his mind and reach for their brand—\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,673\rHavas Media defines meaningful brands as those that inspire the thought, This brand improves my life. This sense of enhancement envelops both the consumer and the brand in an aura of well-being.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,691\rPut simply, we want more from life than money. People want genuine human connection, to be treated fairly, and to be treated honestly.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,692\rGiven this context, to create a meaningful brand in the minds of consumers, it must be authentic. Consumers find a brand trustworthy and meaningful when two stories match: the story the brand tells about itself and the story the public tells about the brand.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,694\rall brand stories must follow one simple principle: The core value of the story must match the core value of the brand. If these stories do not align, if promises made are not kept, the public feels betrayed and their sense of injustice indicts the brand as detrimental to their lives.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,703\rHavas reports that meaningfulness drives disproportionate financial results. Their global study of a thousand companies, employing three hundred thousand people, in thirty-four countries, across twelve industries, found that fully meaningful brands “. . . see their marketing KPIs perform 100 percent better overall compared with less Meaningful Brands.”\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,706\rIn fact, every 10 percent improvement in “meaningfulness” increases purchase intent by 6.6 percent, repurchase intent by 3.2 percent, customer advocacy by 4.8 percent, and premium pricing by 10.4 percent. Meaningful brands gain, on average, 46 percent more share of wallet than those ranked as not meaningful. What’s more, meaningful brands outperformed the overall stock market by 133 percent.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,709\rThe facts are clear: Marketers whose brand stories match consumers’ stories see their tales retold as consumer identification drives significantly better returns for team members and shareholders.\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,713\rMan, I am so glad I saw that advertisement. —Nobody, ever\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,721\rWe need to be in the business of helping our customers gain productive outcomes.

Or care? Doubtful. The Owen stories touch emotions bragging could never reach. That’s power.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,749\rPUT A STORY WITHIN THE STORY\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,751\rThe mind jumps from story to story rather easily. For example, when viewers change channels in search of something good, or when story lines crosscut from central plot to subplot and back, audience engagement switches gears in a heartbeat.

Their company needs demand generation (B2C) or lead generation (B2B) to achieve quarterly results.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,798\rHistorically, in tight quarters CMOs would ramp up the advertising budget to meet revenue goals, or cut the budget to meet earnings. But with the rapid decline of advertising reach and efficacy, they need to turn somewhere new. To understand how brands can drive consumers to purchase and business buyers to engage with sales teams, we need to consider how people discover and consume information and entertainment today.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,803\rInstead online searches drive their active discovery, while social media provides for passive discovery.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,807\rOver the same four weeks, thirty billion people with no specific goal follow curiosity where it leads to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Snapchat, or Pinterest, and by pure coincidence learn something interesting, something of value.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,809\rThese chance revelations often feel like a gift from beyond, so people share their passive discoveries with friends and family, compounding these serendipities from thirty to ninety billion.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,810\rThese tens of billions of discoveries offer an unprecedented marketing opportunity, if you provide the information or entertainment your customers seek.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,813\rThis means that like blank billboards along a highway, search and social discoveries offer CMOs new ways to reach customers and build ongoing relationships,\nOrange highlight | Location: 1,816\rWhat’s more, when someone arrives on your website, what’s the first thing he sees? Your products? Your logo? Your slogan? A list of claims? Really? Never underestimate the power of first impressions.

Let your sales team take her the next step from prospect to customer.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,873\rFirst, the Oral Care Center team finds the topics customers search most and then creates content to match. They ensure each article is optimized to rank well against search queries.7 By search optimizing content, Colgate.com creates an experience that ends the search. Customers find what they need. Every month Colgate.com broadens its audience and builds relationships that last. Second, Colgate does not use the Oral Care Center to promote the benefits of Colgate products. Brands lose credibility when they shift the focus of their content from helping the customer back to the bragging and promising of yesteryear.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,881\rCompanies evolve into content marketing leaders when they move from sustained content creation to sustained storytelling.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,884\rCaleb Barlow, VP IBM Security, explained their unique marketing challenge: “What we have is a very technical issue, a very complex issue, and in some cases a very scary issue that we need to be able to describe to people in order to get them to act. We’re not talking about products, like a collaboration system,\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,886\rthat you log in to and use all day every day. We’re talking about products that, hopefully, you never see as an end user, and in some cases hopefully you never need to use. But boy, you’d better make sure they’re there when you need them. So storytelling becomes extraordinarily important.”\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,894\rThe resulting property, IBM’s award-winning SecurityIntelligence.com, breaks news on hacks, malware, data theft, and software vulnerabilities that can put enterprises at risk, and analyzes how others can avoid the same attacks.9 Hundreds of thousands of CISOs, CIOs, and CTOs visit and return to that property each month and are grateful to IBM for the help.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,897\rCaleb Barlow knows that a company loses credibility when it brags about itself or makes promises about its products.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,898\rSo the vast majority of the content on SecurityIntelligence.com does not mention IBM, its products, or its solutions. Instead IBM simply provides the information that IT professionals need to do their job. As a result, some believe IBM’s credibility on IT security ranks higher than any traditional news source.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,905\r“If you’re buying a security product,\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,905\rit’s kind of like buying a child seat for your kid: You’re not interested in second best,” Barlow explained. “It’s practical, but it’s also emotional.”\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,907\rWhen C-suite executives decide it’s time to make new investments to keep their company safe, their first call goes to IBM Security because the brand became their trusted adviser through the stories shared on SecurityIntelligence.com.10 This is the secret all content marketing leaders know very well.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,911\rThe core value of the story must align with the core value of the brand.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,914\rWhen we apply story form to demand/lead generation marketing, however, we apply the same form differently. In demand/lead generation stories, the protagonist will typically be a customer or prospective customer. The inciting incident will occur, at least in part, because the protagonist is not using the product/service your company offers.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,928\rTo use a story that ends on the negative effectively, marketers turn to comedy, as does Adobe. In comedy, the cardinal rule is that nobody actually gets hurt. If you do not employ comedy, you risk creating negative feelings about your brand—\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,936\rOriginal, sustainable story-driven content creation is not easy. Marketers with this ambition must develop a strategy, license a content marketing platform (CMP), recruit creatives, and implement a process for managing, reviewing, and improving that content every day. A regular publishing cadence of well-told stories requires time, money, and resources.\nBlue highlight | Location: 1,940\rFor that reason, some marketers cut corners and try to license or curate instead.

As we learn how to step up to crucial conversations—and handle them well—with one set of high-leverage skills we can influence virtually every domain of our lives.\nBlue highlight | Page: 20\rOne of the opinion leaders we became particularly interested in meeting was named Kevin. He was the only one of eight vice presidents in his company to be identified as exceedingly influential. We wanted to know why. So we watched him at work. At first, Kevin didn’t do anything remarkable. In truth, he looked like every other VP. He answered his phone, talked to his direct reports, and continued about his pleasant, but routine, routine.\nBlue highlight | Page: 20\rteam. No vague claim went unclarified, no unsupported reasoning unquestioned.\nBlue highlight | Page: 21\rKevin continued to explain what he saw happening, and when he finished the first minutes of this delicate exchange, Chris was quiet for a moment. Then he nodded his head. “You’re absolutely right,” he finally concluded. “I have been trying to force my opinion on you. Let’s back up and try again.”\nBlue highlight | Page: 21\r“Did you see how he did that? If you want to know how he gets things done, figure out what he just did.”\nBlue highlight | Page: 21\rSo we did. In fact, we spent the next twenty-five years discovering what Kevin and people like him do. What typically set them apart from the rest of the pack was their ability to avoid what we came to call the Fool’s Choice.\nBlue highlight | Page: 22\rThe mistake most of us make in our crucial conversations is we believe that we have to choose between telling the truth and keeping a friend.\nBlue highlight | Page: 22\rConsider Kevin, the all-star. When he took a breath and opened his mouth, his overriding question was, “How can I be 100 percent honest with Chris, and at the same time be 100 percent respectful?”\nBlue highlight | Page: 22\rThey not only refused to make the Fool’s Choice, but they then acted in ways that were far more skilled than their colleagues.\nBlue highlight | Page: 23\rWhen it comes to risky, controversial, and emotional conversations, skilled people find a way to get all relevant information (from themselves and others) out into the open.\nBlue highlight | Page: 23\rAt the core of every successful conversation lies the free flow of relevant information. People openly and honestly express their opinions, share their feelings, and articulate their theories. They willingly and capably share their views, even when their ideas are controversial or unpopular. It’s the one thing that, and precisely what, Kevin and the other extremely effective communicators we studied were routinely able to achieve. Now, to put a label on this spectacular talent—it’s called dialogue.\nBlue highlight | Page: 23\rdi·a·logue or di·a·log (dì´ ∂-lôg´´, -lòg) n The free flow of meaning between two or more people.\nBlue highlight | Page: 24\rEach of us enters conversations with our own opinions, feelings, theories, and experiences about the topic at hand. This unique combination of thoughts and feelings makes up our personal pool of meaning. This pool not only informs us, but also propels our every action.\nBlue highlight | Page: 24\rPeople who are skilled at dialogue do their best to make it safe for everyone to add their meaning to the shared pool—even ideas that at first glance appear controversial, wrong, or at odds with their own beliefs. Now, obviously, they don’t agree with every idea; they simply do their best to ensure that all ideas find their way into the open.\nBlue highlight | Page: 24\rAs the Pool of Shared Meaning grows, it helps people in two ways. First, as individuals are exposed to more accurate and relevant information, they make better choices.\nBlue highlight | Page: 24\rIn a very real sense, the Pool of Shared Meaning is a measure of\nBlue highlight | Page: 24\ra group’s IQ. The larger the shared pool, the smarter the decisions. And even though many people may be involved in a choice, when people openly and freely share ideas, the increased time investment is more than offset by the quality of the decision.\nBlue highlight | Page: 24\rOn the other hand, we’ve all seen what happens when the shared pool is dangerously shallow. When people purposefully withhold meaning from one another, individually smart people can do collectively stupid things.\nBlue highlight | Page: 25\rOf course, hospitals don’t have a monopoly on fear. In every instance where bosses are smart, highly paid, confident, and outspoken (i.e., most of the world), people tend to hold back their opinions rather than risk angering someone in a position of power. On the other hand, when people feel comfortable speaking up and meaning does flow freely, the shared pool can dramatically increase a group’s ability\nBlue highlight | Page: 25\rto make better decisions. Consider what happened to Kevin’s group. As everyone on the team began to explain his or her opinion, people formed a clearer and more complete picture of the circumstances.\nBlue highlight | Page: 25\rAs a result of the free flow of meaning, the whole (final choice) was truly greater than the sum of…\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nBlue highlight | Page: 25\rNot only does a shared pool help individuals make better choices, but since the meaning is shared, people willingly act…\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nBlue highlight | Page: 25\rwith both unity and…\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nBlue highlight | Page: 26\rFor example, Kevin and the other VPs didn’t buy into their final choice simply because they were involved; they…\rSome highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.\nBlue highlight | Page: 26\rwhen people aren’t involved, when they sit back quietly during touchy conversations, they’re rarely committed to the final decision.

We then taught these skills and watched as key performance indicators and relationships improved.\nBlue highlight | Page: 29\rOn a beautiful sunset balcony in Houston, my dad and I spent three tense hours dealing with a lot of pain and built-up resentment. I kept in mind what I had been taught and, rather than compromising candor, tried my best to create the conditions where we could be both honest and respectful. It was incredibly difficult. Sometimes the honesty threatened to put us right back in the angry state that got us there. But I kept focusing on what I really wanted—a relationship with my family.\nBlue highlight | Page: 30\rThis is what most people have in mind when they think of crucial conversations. How do I express delicate feedback? How do I speak persuasively, not abrasively? And how about listening? Or better still, what can we do to get people to talk when they seem nervous?

As you read on, you will learn the key skills of talking, listening, and acting\nYellow highlight | Page: 35\rOur problem is not that our behavior degenerates.

Of course, we don’t always fix mistakes, aggressively discredit others, or heartlessly try to make them suffer.\nOrange highlight | Page: 41\rWe were wondering what had happened to Greta? How, we puzzled, did she remain so composed while under fire? Specifically, how did she move so quickly from wanting to get even with or possibly even humiliate the questioner to sincerely soliciting feedback?\nOrange highlight | Page: 41\rWhat had helped her move from embarrassment and anger to gratitude?\nOrange highlight | Page: 41\r“At first I did feel attacked, and I wanted to strike back.

As she focused on this far more important question, she quickly realized that her goal was to encourage these 200 managers to embrace the cost-reduction efforts—and to thereby influence thousands of others to do the same.\nOrange highlight | Page: 41\rAs Greta contemplated this goal, she realized that the biggest barrier she faced was the widespread belief that she was a hypocrite.\nOrange highlight | Page: 42\rInterestingly, by transforming her motives Greta simultaneously transformed the way she saw the man who asked the question. Whereas seconds earlier he looked like an enemy, when her motives changed, the fellow now looked like an ally. In fact, this man had just handed her the best chance she could get to influence the audience by letting her publicly address a primary source of resistance to the cost-cutting effort. And so Greta moved to dialogue.\nOrange highlight | Page: 42\rintervention—the simple act of asking a potent question—can have a powerful effect on redirecting our hearts.\nBlue highlight | Page: 42\rRefocus your brain. Now, let’s move to a situation you might face. You’re speaking with someone who completely disagrees with you on a hot issue. How does all of this goal stuff apply? As you begin the discussion, start by examining your motives. Going in, ask yourself what you really want. Also, as the conversation unfolds and you find yourself starting to, say, defer to the boss or give your spouse the cold shoulder, pay attention to what’s happening to your objectives.

Think of what you are afraid will happen to you if you back away from your current strategy of trying to win or stay safe. What bad thing will happen if you stop pushing so hard? Or if you don’t try to escape? What horrible outcome makes game playing an attractive and sensible option? “What I don’t want is to have a useless and heated conversation that creates bad feelings and doesn’t lead to change.” Third, present your brain with a more complex problem.\nBlue highlight | Page: 47\rThere is a third set of options out there that allows you to add meaning to the pool and build on the relationship.\nBlue highlight | Page: 48\rAt first, we thought that maybe there were places where dialogue couldn’t survive. But then we learned to ask: “Are you saying there isn’t anyone you know who is able to hold a high-risk conversation in a way that solves problems and builds relationships?” There usually is.\nBlue highlight | Page: 48\rWork on Me First, Us Second • Remember that the only person you can directly control is yourself.\nBlue highlight | Page: 48\rFocus on What You Really Want\nBlue highlight | Page: 48\rWhen you find yourself moving toward silence or violence, stop and pay attention to your motives.\nBlue highlight | Page: 48\rAsk yourself: “What does my behavior tell me about what my motives are?” • Then, clarify what you really want. Ask yourself: “What do I want for myself?\nBlue highlight | Page: 48\rFor others? For the relationship?” • And finally, ask: “How would I behave if this were what I really wanted?”\nBlue highlight | Page: 48\rAs you consider what you want, notice when you start talking yourself into a Fool’s Choice. • Watch to see if you’re telling yourself that you must choose between peace and honesty, between winning and losing, and so on. • Break free of these Fool’s Choices by searching for the and. • Clarify what you don’t want, add it to what you do want, and ask your brain to start searching for healthy options to bring you to dialogue.\nBlue highlight | Page: 52\r“Yeah,” your coworker explains, “I always watch two elements. When things start turning ugly, I watch the content of the conversation (the topic under discussion) along with the conditions (what people are doing in response). I look for and examine both what and why. If you can see why people are becoming upset or holding back their views or even going silent, you can do something to get back on track.”\nBlue highlight | Page: 53\rIn truth, most of us do have trouble dual-processing (simultaneously watching for content and conditions)—especially when both stakes and emotions are high.\nYellow highlight | Page: 54\rActually, it helps to watch for three different conditions: the moment a conversation turns crucial, signs that people don’t feel safe (silence or violence), and your own Style Under Stress. Let’s consider each of these conversation killers in turn.\nYellow highlight | Page: 54\rTo help catch problems early, reprogram your mind to\nYellow highlight | Page: 54\rpay attention to the signs that suggest you’re in a crucial conversation. Some people first notice physical signals—their stomach gets tight or their eyes get dry. Think about what happens to your body when conversations get tough. Everyone is a little bit different. What are your cues? Whatever they are, learn to look at them as signs to step back, slow down, and Start with Heart before things get out of hand.\nYellow highlight | Page: 55\rPeople who are\nYellow highlight | Page: 55\rgifted at dialogue keep a constant vigil on safety. They pay\nYellow highlight | Page: 55\rWhen it’s safe, you can say anything. Here’s why gifted communicators keep a close eye on safety. Dialogue calls for the free flow of meaning—period. And nothing kills the flow of meaning like fear.\nYellow highlight | Page: 55\rThis is a pretty remarkable claim. Think about it. We’re suggesting that people rarely become defensive simply because of what you’re saying. They only become defensive when they no longer feel safe. The problem is not the content of your message, but the condition of the conversation.\nYellow highlight | Page: 56\rOn the other hand, if you don’t feel safe, you can’t take any feedback.\nYellow highlight | Page: 56\rIt’s as if the pool of meaning has a lid on it. “What do you mean I look good? Is that some kind of joke? Are you insulting me?” When you don’t feel safe, even well-intended comments are suspect.\nYellow highlight | Page: 56\rWhen it’s unsafe, you start to go blind.\nYellow highlight | Page: 57\rAs we’ve said before, when your emotions start cranking up, key brain functions start shutting down. Not only do you prepare to take flight, but your peripheral vision actually narrows. In fact, when you feel genuinely threatened, you can scarcely see beyond what’s right in front of you.\nYellow highlight | Page: 57\rBy pulling yourself out of the content of an argument and looking for signs that safety is a risk, you reengage your brain and your full vision returns.\nYellow highlight | Page: 57\rAs we suggested earlier, when you give your brain a new problem to consider (keep alert for signs that safety is at risk!), it affects your brain functioning. Your higher reasoning centers stay more active, and you’re far less likely to be dumbed down and far more likely to succeed in your crucial conversation.\nYellow highlight | Page: 57\rDon’t let safety problems lead you astray.\nYellow highlight | Page: 57\rImagine the magnitude of what we’re suggesting here. We’re asking you to recode silence and violence as signs that people are feeling unsafe.\nYellow highlight | Page: 57\rWe’re asking you to fight your natural tendency to respond in kind.\nYellow highlight | Page: 57\rWe’re asking you to undo years of practice, maybe even eons of genetic shaping that prod you to take flight or pick a fight (when under attack), and recode the stimulus. “Ah, that’s a sign that the other person feels unsafe.” And then what? Do something to make it safe.\nYellow highlight | Page: 58\rImagine increased influence, enhanced relationships, stronger teams, and more effective leadership. Turn on your capacity to recognize and respond to safety problems.\nYellow highlight | Page: 58\rIn the next chapter we’ll explore how. For now, simply learn to look for safety, and then be curious, not angry or frightened.\nYellow highlight | Page: 58\rAs people begin to feel unsafe, they start down one of two unhealthy paths. They move either to silence (withholding meaning from the pool) or to violence (trying to force\nYellow highlight | Page: 58\rThe three most common forms of silence are masking, avoiding, and withdrawing.\nYellow highlight | Page: 60\rThe three most common forms are controlling, labeling, and attacking.\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rActually, no. Perhaps the most difficult element to watch closely as you’re madly dual-processing is your own behavior. Frankly,\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rUnfortunately, when you fail to monitor your own behavior, you can look pretty silly.\nYellow highlight | Page: 75\rThe good realize that safety is at risk, but they fix it in exactly the wrong way.\nYellow highlight | Page: 75\rThey try to make the subject more palatable by sugarcoating their message.\nYellow highlight | Page: 75\rThe best don’t play games. Period.\nYellow highlight | Page: 76\rSo they do something completely different. They step out of the content of the conversation, make it safe, and then step back in. Once safety is restored, they can talk about nearly anything.\nYellow highlight | Page: 76\rFor example, Yvonne gets back on the path of dialogue by saying: “Can we change gears for a minute? I’d like to talk about what happens when we’re not romantically in sync. It would be good if we could both share what’s working and what isn’t. My goal isn’t to make you feel guilty, and I certainly don’t want to become defensive. What I’d really love is for us to come up with a solution that makes us both satisfied in our relationship.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 76\rbut because they believe the content (even if it’s delivered in a gentle way) suggests that you have a malicious intent.\nYellow highlight | Page: 77\rHow can others feel safe when they believe you’re out to harm them? Soon, every word out of your mouth is suspect. You can’t utter a harmless “good morning” without others interpreting it in a negative way.\nYellow highlight | Page: 77\rMutual Purpose is the entry condition of dialogue. Find a shared goal, and you have both a good reason and a healthy climate for talking.\nYellow highlight | Page: 77\rWatch for signs that Mutual Purpose is at risk. How do we\nYellow highlight | Page: 77\rDo others believe I care about their goals in this conversation? • Do they trust my motives?\nYellow highlight | Page: 77\rRemember the Mutual in Mutual Purpose. Just a word to the wise.\nYellow highlight | Page: 78\rWhat do I want for me? • What do I want for others? • What do I want for the relationship?\nYellow highlight | Page: 78\rLook for the mutuality.\nYellow highlight | Page: 78\rLet’s say you’ve got a boss who frequently fails to keep commitments. How could you tell the boss you don’t trust him? Surely there’s no way to say this without the boss becoming defensive or vengeful, because he knows that your goal is merely to make your life better. To avoid disaster, find a Mutual Purpose that would be so motivating to the boss that he’d want to hear your concerns. If your only reason for approaching the boss is to get\nYellow highlight | Page: 78\rwhat you want, the boss will hear you as critical and selfish—\nYellow highlight | Page: 78\rwhich is what you are.\nYellow highlight | Page: 78\rImagine raising the topic this way: “I’ve got some ideas for how I can be much more reliable and even reduce costs by a few thousand dollars in preparing the report each month. It’s going to be a bit of a sensitive conversation—but I think it will help a great deal if we can talk about it.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 79\rWhile it’s true that there’s no reason to enter a crucial conversation if you don’t have Mutual Purpose, it’s equally true that you can’t stay in the conversation if you don’t maintain Mutual Respect. Mutual Respect is the continuance condition of dialogue. As people perceive that others don’t respect them, the conversation immediately becomes unsafe and dialogue comes to a screeching halt.\nYellow highlight | Page: 79\rWhy? Because respect is like air. As long as it’s present, nobody thinks about it. But if you take it away, it’s all that people can think about. The instant people perceive disrespect in a conversation, the interaction is no longer about the original purpose—it is now about defending dignity.\nYellow highlight | Page: 79\rTelltale signs. To spot when respect is violated and safety takes a turn south, watch for signs that people are defending their dignity.\nBlue highlight | Page: 79\rEmotions\nBlue highlight | Page: 79\rWhen people feel disrespected, they become highly charged. Their emotions turn from fear to anger. Then they resort to pouting, name-calling, yelling, and making threats. Ask the following question to determine when Mutual Respect is at risk:\nYellow highlight | Page: 80\rDo others believe I respect them?\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\rHow, they wonder, can they share the same purpose with people who come from completely different backgrounds or whose morals or values differ from theirs? What do you do, for example, if you’re upset because another person has let you down? And if this has repeatedly happened, how can you respect a person who is so poorly motivated and selfish?\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\rDialogue truly would be doomed if we had to share every objective or respect every element of another person’s character before we could talk.\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\rHowever, we can stay in dialogue by finding a way to honor and regard another person’s basic humanity.\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\rIn essence, feelings of disrespect often come when we dwell on how others are different from ourselves.\nNote:Difference - disrespect\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\rWe can counteract these feelings by looking for ways we are similar. Without excusing others’ behavior, we try to sympathize, even empathize, with them.\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\rprayer—“Lord, help me forgive those who sin differently than I.”\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\rWhen we do this, we feel a kinship or mutuality between ourselves and even the thorniest of people.\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\rThis sense of kinship and connection to others helps create Mutual Respect and eventually enables us to stay in dialogue with virtually anyone.\nBlue highlight | Page: 81\rEach group was to go into a separate room and write out its goals for the company on flip-chart-sized paper.\nBlue highlight | Page: 81\rAfter a few minutes the two groups returned to the training room. They were positively stunned. It was as if they had written the exact same lists. They didn’t merely share the shadow of an idea or two. Their aspirations were nearly identical. All wanted a profitable company, stable and rewarding jobs, high-quality products, and a positive impact on the community. Given a chance to speak freely and without fear of attack, each group laid out not simply what it wanted, but what virtually every person wanted.\nBlue highlight | Page: 82\rApologize • Contrast • Create a Mutual Purpose\nBlue highlight | Page: 83\rBut you fail to restore safety. Why? Because now you feel disrespected. They’ve attacked you. So you stay stuck in the content of the conversation—thinking this has something to do with the factory tour.\nBlue highlight | Page: 83\rSee their aggressive behavior for what it is—a sign of violated safety—\nBlue highlight | Page: 84\rWhen you’ve made a mistake that has hurt others (e.g., you didn’t call the team), start with an apology. An apology is a statement that sincerely expresses your sorrow for your role in causing—or at least not preventing—pain or difficulty to others.\nBlue highlight | Page: 84\rNow, an apology isn’t really an apology unless you experience a change in heart. To offer a sincere apology, your motives have to change. You have to give up saving face, being right, or winning in order to focus on what you really want. You have to sacrifice a bit of your ego by admitting your error. But like many sacrifices, when you give up something you value, you’re rewarded with something even more valuable—healthy dialogue and better results.\nBlue highlight | Page: 84\rSometimes others feel disrespected during crucial conversations even though you haven’t done anything disrespectful.\nBlue highlight | Page: 84\rBut just as often, the insult is entirely unintended.\nBlue highlight | Page: 85\rWhen others misinterpret either your purpose or your intent, step out of the argument and rebuild safety by using a skill called Contrasting.\nBlue highlight | Page: 85\rContrasting is a don’t/do statement that:\nBlue highlight | Page: 85\rAddresses others’ concerns that you don’t respect them or that you have a malicious purpose (the don’t part). • Confirms your respect or clarifies your real purpose (the do part).\nBlue highlight | Page: 85\r[The don’t part] “The last thing I wanted to do was communicate that I don’t value the work you put in or that I didn’t want to share it with the VP. [The do part] I think your work has been nothing short of spectacular.”\nBlue highlight | Page: 86\rOf the two parts of Contrasting, the don’t is the more important because it deals with the misunderstanding that has put safety at risk.\nBlue highlight | Page: 87\rContrasting provides context and proportion.\nBlue highlight | Page: 87\ryou talk with your assistant about his lack\nBlue highlight | Page: 88\rAt this point, you could be tempted to water down your content—“You know it’s really not that big a deal.” Don’t give into the temptation. Don’t take back what you’ve said. Instead, put your remarks in context.\nBlue highlight | Page: 88\r“Let me put this in perspective. I don’t want you to think I’m not satisfied with the quality of your work. I want us to continue working together. I really do think you’re doing a good job. This punctuality issue is important to me, and I’d just like you to work on that. If you will be more attentive to that, there are no other issues.”\nBlue highlight | Page: 88\rUse Contrasting for prevention or first aid. Contrasting can be useful both as prevention and as first aid for safety problems.\nBlue highlight | Page: 88\rSo far our examples have helped us apply first\nYellow highlight | Page: 88\raid to a wounded conversation. Someone has taken something wrong, and we’ve intervened to clarify our true purpose or meaning. When we’re aware that something we’re about to drop into the pool of meaning\nBlue highlight | Page: 88\rWhen people misunderstand and you start arguing over the misunderstanding, stop. Use Contrasting. Explain what you don’t mean until you’ve restored safety. Then return to the conversation. Safety first.\nBlue highlight | Page: 91\rThe worst at dialogue either ignore the problem and push ahead or roll over and let others have their way. They opt for either competition or submission. Both strategies end up making winners and losers, and the problem continues long beyond the initial conversation.\nBlue highlight | Page: 91\rThe good at dialogue move immediately toward compromise. For example, the couple facing the transfer sets up two house-holds—one where the transferred spouse will be working and one where the family currently lives. Nobody really wants this arrangement, and frankly, it’s a pretty ugly solution that’s bound to lead to more serious problems, even divorce. While compromise is sometimes necessary,\nBlue highlight | Page: 91\rThe best at dialogue use four skills to create a Mutual Purpose. If it helps you remember what to do, note that the four skills used in creating Mutual Purpose form the acronym CRIB.\nYellow highlight | Page: 104\rYou make you mad. You make you scared, annoyed, or insulted. You and only you create your emotions.\nYellow highlight | Page: 104\rClaim two. Once you’ve created your upset emotions, you have only two options: You can act on them or be acted on by them. That is, when it comes to strong emotions, you either find a way to master them or fall hostage to them. Here’s how this all unfolds.\nYellow highlight | Page: 106\rThe best at dialogue do something completely different. They aren’t held hostage by their emotions, nor do they try to hide or suppress them. Instead, they act on their emotions. That is, when they have strong\nYellow highlight | Page: 107\rfeelings, they influence (and often change) their emotions by thinking them out. As a result, they choose their emotions, and by so doing, make it possible to choose behaviors that create better results.\nYellow highlight | Page: 107\rholding her feelings inside (avoiding) and taking cheap shots (masking).\nYellow highlight | Page: 108\rAs it turns out, there is an intermediate step between what others do and how we feel.\nYellow highlight | Page: 108\rThere’s always an intermediate step because actions themselves can’t and don’t cause emotional reactions. That’s why, when faced with the exact same circumstances, ten people may have ten different emotional responses. For instance, with a coworker like Louis, some might feel insulted whereas others merely feel curious. Some become angry and others feel concern or even sympathy.\nYellow highlight | Page: 108\rWhat is this intermediate step? Just after we observe what others do and just before we feel some emotion about it, we tell ourselves a story.\nYellow highlight | Page: 108\rWe add meaning to the action we observed. We make a guess at the motive driving the behavior.\nYellow highlight | Page: 108\rWhy were they doing that? We also add judgment—is that good or bad? And then, based on these thoughts or stories, our body responds with\nYellow highlight | Page: 108\ran emotion.\nYellow highlight | Page: 109\rStories provide our rationale for\nYellow highlight | Page: 109\rwhat’s going on. They’re our interpretations of the facts. They help explain what we see and hear. They’re theories we use to explain why, how, and what. For instance, Maria asks: “Why does Louis take over? He doesn’t trust my ability to communicate. He thinks that because I’m a woman, people won’t listen to me.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 111\rIf we take control of our stories, they won’t control us. People who excel at dialogue are able to influence their emotions during crucial conversations. They recognize that while it’s true that at first we are in control of the stories we tell—after all, we do make them up of our own accord—once they’re told, the stories control us.\nYellow highlight | Page: 111\rBut it doesn’t have to be this way. We can tell different stories and break the loop. In fact, until we tell different stories, we cannot break the loop.\nYellow highlight | Page: 113\rNot only do those who are best at crucial conversations notice when they’re slipping into silence or violence, but they’re also able to admit it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 113\rThe moment they realize that they’re killing dialogue, they review their own Path to Action.\nYellow highlight | Page: 113\rActually, identifying your emotions is more difficult than you might imagine. In fact, many people are emotionally illiterate. When asked to describe how they’re feeling, they use words such as “bad”\nYellow highlight | Page: 113\ror “angry” or “frightened”—which would be okay if these were accurate descriptors, but often they’re not.\nYellow highlight | Page: 113\rIndividuals say they’re angry when, in fact, they’re feeling a mix of embarrassment and surprise. Or they suggest they’re unhappy when they’re feeling violated. Perhaps they suggest they’re upset when\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rthey’re really feeling humiliated and cheated.\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rSince life doesn’t consist of a series of vocabulary tests, you might wonder what difference words can make. But words do matter. Knowing what you’re really feeling helps you take a more accurate look at what is going on and why. For instance, you’re far\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rmore likely to take an honest look at the story you’re telling yourself if you admit you’re feeling both embarrassed and surprised rather than simply angry.\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rMeaning, of course, are you telling the right story? After all, feelings come from stories, and stories are our own invention.\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rThe first step to regaining emotional control is to challenge the illusion that what you’re feeling is the only right emotion under the circumstances.\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rThis may be the hardest step, but it’s also the most important one.\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rBy questioning our feelings, we open ourselves up to question our stories. We challenge the comfortable conclusion that our story is right and true. We willingly question whether our emotions (very real), and the story behind them (only one of many possible explanations), are accurate.\nYellow highlight | Page: 115\rAs we said earlier, others could watch Maria’s interactions with Louis and walk away with different stories.\nYellow highlight | Page: 115\rTest your ideas against a simple criterion: Can you see or hear this thing you’re calling a fact? Was it an actual behavior?\nYellow highlight | Page: 115\rHowever, the statement “He doesn’t trust me” is a conclusion. It explains what you think, not what the other person did. Conclusions are subjective.\nYellow highlight | Page: 116\rEither our stories are completely accurate and propel us in healthy directions, or they’re quite inaccurate but justify our current behavior\nYellow highlight | Page: 116\rus feel good about ourselves and calling for no need to change.\nYellow highlight | Page: 116\rWe call these imaginative and self-serving concoctions “clever stories.” They’re clever because they allow us to feel good about behaving badly. Better yet, they allow us to feel good about behaving badly even while achieving abysmal results. When we feel a need to justify\nYellow highlight | Page: 116\rwe tend to tell our stories in three very predictable ways. Learn what the three are and how to counteract them, and you can take control of your emotional\nYellow highlight | Page: 118\rIn Victim Stories we exaggerate our own innocence. In Villain Stories we overemphasize the other person’s guilt or stupidity.\nYellow highlight | Page: 118\rWe automatically assume the worst possible motives or grossest incompetence while ignoring any possible good or neutral\nYellow highlight | Page: 118\rintentions or skills a person may have.\nYellow highlight | Page: 118\rLabeling is a common device in Villain Stories. For example, “I can’t believe that bonehead gave me bad materials again.” By employing the handy label, we are now dealing not with a complex human being, but with a bonehead.\nYellow highlight | Page: 118\rAfter all, we can feel okay insulting or abusing a bonehead—whereas we might have to be more careful with a living, breathing person.\nYellow highlight | Page: 118\rThen when we fail to get the results we really want, we stay stuck in our ineffective behavior because, after all, look who we’re dealing with!\nYellow highlight | Page: 119\rFinally come Helpless Stories. In\nYellow highlight | Page: 119\rthese fabrications we make ourselves out to be powerless to do anything healthy or helpful.\nYellow highlight | Page: 119\rWe convince ourselves that there are no healthy alternatives for dealing with our predicament, which justifies the action we’re about to take.\nYellow highlight | Page: 119\rVillain and Victim Stories look back to explain why we’re in the situation we’re in, Helpless Stories look forward to explain why we can’t do anything to change our situation.\nYellow highlight | Page: 119\rhelpless when we turn others’ behavior into fixed and unchangeable traits. For example, when we decide our colleague is a “control freak” (Villain Story), we are less inclined to give her feedback because, after all, control freaks like her don’t accept feedback (Helpless Story). Nothing we can do will change that fact.\nYellow highlight | Page: 119\rAs you can see, Helpless Stories often stem from Villain Stories and typically offer us nothing more than Fool’s Choices— we can either be honest and ruin the relationship or stay silent and suffer.\nYellow highlight | Page: 119\rClever stories match reality.\nYellow highlight | Page: 120\rClever stories get us off the hook.\nYellow highlight | Page: 121\rYour spouse’s annoying habit didn’t become a source of resentment until you became part of the problem.\nYellow highlight | Page: 122\rOnce we’ve learned to recognize the clever stories we tell ourselves, we can move to the final Master My Stories skill. The dialogue-smart\nYellow highlight | Page: 122\rrecognize that they’re telling clever stories, stop, and then do what it takes to tell a useful story. A useful story, by definition, creates emotions that lead to healthy action—such as dialogue.\nYellow highlight | Page: 123\r• Am I pretending not to notice my role in the problem? This question jars you into facing up to the fact that maybe, just maybe, you did something to help cause the problem.\nYellow highlight | Page: 123\rPerhaps your contribution was merely a thoughtless omission. Nonetheless, you contributed.\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rTurn villains into humans. When you find yourself labeling or otherwise vilifying others, stop and ask:\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\r• Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do what this person is doing? This particular question humanizes others. As we search for plausible answers to it, our emotions soften. Empathy often replaces judgment, and depending upon how we’ve treated others, personal accountability replaces self-justification.\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rWhy would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do what this person is doing?\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rAs we search for plausible answers to it, our emotions soften. Empathy often replaces judgment, and depending upon how we’ve treated others, personal accountability replaces self-justification.\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rBut what if she really were a reasonable, rational, and decent person? What if she had no motive other than to give you a hand? Isn’t it a bit early to be vilifying her? And if you do, don’t you run the risk of ruining a relationship?\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rThe purpose of the humanizing question is to deal with our own stories and emotions. It provides us with still another tool for working on ourselves first by providing a variety of possible reasons for the other person’s behavior.\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rIn fact, with experience and maturity we learn to worry less about others’ intent and more about the effect others’ actions are having on us.\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rAnd here’s the good news. When we reflect on alternative motives, not only do we soften our emotions, but equally important, we relax our absolute certainty long enough to allow for dialogue— the only reliable way of discovering others’ genuine motives.\nYellow highlight | Page: 125\rTurn the helpless into the able. Finally, when you catch yourself bemoaning your own helplessness, you can tell the complete story by returning to your original motive. To do so, stop and ask:\nYellow highlight | Page: 125\rWhat do I really want? For me? For others? For the relationship? Then, kill the Fool’s Choice that’s made you feel helpless to choose anything other than silence or violence. Do this by asking:\nYellow highlight | Page: 125\r• What would I do right now if I really wanted these results?\nYellow highlight | Page: 125\rWhat would I do right now if I really wanted these results?\nYellow highlight | Page: 125\rWhen you refuse to make yourself helpless, you’re forced to hold yourself accountable for using your dialogue skills rather than bemoaning your weakness.\nYellow highlight | Page: 126\rAs we tell the rest of the story, we free ourselves from the poisoning effects of unhealthy emotions. Best of all, as we regain control and move back to dialogue, we become masters of our own emotions rather than hostages.\nYellow highlight | Page: 128\rAs soon as she shows signs of frustration, I stop and remind her that I am on her side.\nYellow highlight | Page: 131\rSo far we’ve gone to great pains to prepare ourselves to step up to and master crucial conversations. Here’s what we’ve learned. Our hearts need to be in the right place. We need to pay close attention to crucial conversations—particularly when people start feeling unsafe—and restore safety when necessary. And heaven forbid that we should tell ourselves clever and unhelpful stories.\nYellow highlight | Page: 131\rMost of the time, we walk into a discussion and slide into autopilot. “Hi, how are the kids? What’s going on at work?” What could be easier than talking? We know thousands of words and generally weave them into sentences that suit our needs. Most of the time.\nYellow highlight | Page: 132\rHowever, when stakes rise and our emotions kick in, well, that’s when we open our mouths and don’t do so well.\nYellow highlight | Page: 132\rIn fact, as we suggested earlier, the more important the discussion, the less likely we are to be on our best behavior. More specifically, we advocate or express our views quite poorly.\nYellow highlight | Page: 132\r“I’m sorry, Marta, but people simply don’t like working with you. You’ve been asked to leave the special-projects team.” It’s one thing to argue that your company needs to shift from green to red packaging; it’s quite another to tell a person that he or she is offensive or unlikable.

They are confident that their opinions deserve to be placed in the pool of meaning. They are also confident that they can speak openly without brutalizing others or causing undue offense.\nYellow highlight | Page: 133\rSkilled people are confident that they have something to say, but also realize that others have valuable input. They are humble enough to realize that they don’t have a monopoly on the truth nor do they always have to win their way.\nYellow highlight | Page: 134\rThis means they’re willing to both express their opinions and encourage others to do the same.

Most people agree that jumping in with an ugly accusation followed by a threat is a good candidate for that distinction. It’s also what most people do, and Carole is no exception.\nYellow highlight | Page: 136\rShare your facts • Tell your story • Ask for others’ paths • Talk tentatively • Encourage testing\nYellow highlight | Page: 137\rOf course, starting with our ugly stories is the most controversial, least influential, and most insulting way we could begin.\nYellow highlight | Page: 138\rit. We hold it inside where the story builds up steam, and when we do eventually share our horrific story, we do so with a vengeance. The cycle starts all over again.\nYellow highlight | Page: 138\rFacts are the least controversial. Facts provide a safe beginning. By their very nature, facts aren’t controversial. That’s why we call them facts. For example, consider the statement: “Yesterday you arrived at work twenty minutes late.” No dispute there. Conclusions, on the other hand, are highly controversial. For example: “You can’t be trusted.” That’s hardly a fact. Actually, it’s more like an insult, and\nYellow highlight | Page: 138\rFacts are the most persuasive. In addition to being less controversial, facts are also more persuasive than subjective conclusions. Facts form the foundation of belief. So if you want to persuade others, don’t start with your stories. Start with your observations. For example, which of the following do you find more persuasive?\nYellow highlight | Page: 138\r“I want you to stop sexually harassing me!” or “When you talk to me, your eyes move up and down rather than look at my face. And sometimes you put your hand on my shoulder.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 139\rWhen we start with shocking or offensive conclusions (“Quit groping me with your eyes!” or “I think we should declare bankruptcy”), we actually encourage others to tell Villain Stories about us. Since we’ve given them no facts to\nYellow highlight | Page: 139\rsupport our conclusion, they make up reasons we’re saying these things. They’re likely to believe we’re either stupid or evil.\nYellow highlight | Page: 139\rAnd if you aren’t sure what your facts are (your story is absolutely filling your brain), take the time to think them through before you enter the crucial conversation. Take the time to sort out facts from conclusions. Gathering the facts is the homework required for crucial conversations. Facts are the least insulting. If you do want to share your story, don’t start with it. Your story (particularly if it has led to a rather ugly conclusion) could easily surprise and insult others. It could kill safety in one rash, ill-conceived sentence.\nYellow highlight | Page: 140\rBegin your path with facts. In order to talk about your stories, you need to lead the others involved down your Path to Action. Let them experience your path from the beginning to the end, and not from the end to—well, to wherever\nYellow highlight | Page: 140\rEarn the right to share your story by starting with your facts. Facts lay the groundwork for all delicate conversations.\nYellow highlight | Page: 140\rSharing your story can be tricky. Even if you’ve started with your facts, the other person can still become defensive when you move from facts to stories. After all, you’re sharing potentially unflattering conclusions and judgments.\nYellow highlight | Page: 141\r(Sounds like it’s time for a conclusion.) “I was wondering what the software is doing in your briefcase. It looks like you’re taking it home. Is that what’s going on here?”\nYellow highlight | Page: 141\rIt takes confidence. To be honest, it can be difficult to share negative conclusions and unattractive judgments (e.g., “I’m wondering if you’re a thief”). It takes confidence to share such a potentially inflammatory story. However, if you’ve done your homework by thinking through the facts behind your story, you’ll realize that you are drawing\nYellow highlight | Page: 141\rBy thinking through the facts and then leading with them, you’re much more likely to have the confidence you need to add controversial and vitally important meaning to the shared pool.\nYellow highlight | Page: 142\rLook for safety problems. As you share your story, watch for signs that safety is deteriorating. If people start becoming defensive or appear to be insulted, step out of the conversation and rebuild safety by Contrasting.\nYellow highlight | Page: 143\rBe careful not to apologize for your views. Remember, the goal of Contrasting is not to water down your message, but to be sure that people don’t hear more than you intend. Be confident enough to share what you really want to\nYellow highlight | Page: 144\rOne of the ironies of dialogue is that, when talking with those holding opposing opinions, the more convinced and forceful you act, the more resistant others become. Speaking in absolute and overstated terms does not increase your influence, it decreases it. The converse is also true—the more tentatively you speak, the more open people become to your opinions.\nYellow highlight | Page: 145\r“It’s starting to look like you’re\nYellow highlight | Page: 145\r“It’s leading me to conclude that you’re\nYellow highlight | Page: 145\rstarting to use drugs. Do you have another explanation that I’m missing\nYellow highlight | Page: 146\rright: “I’m starting to feel like you don’t trust me. Is that what’s going on here? If so, I’d like to know what I did to lose your trust.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 146\rJust right: “I don’t think you’re intending this, but I’m beginning to feel rejected.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 146\rSafety becomes particularly important when you’re having a crucial conversation with people who might move to silence. Some people make Fool’s Choices in these circumstances. They worry that if they share their true opinions, others will clam up. So they choose between speaking their minds and hearing others out. But the best at dialogue don’t choose. They do both. They understand that the only limit to how strongly you can express your opinion is your willingness to be equally vigorous in encouraging others to challenge\nYellow highlight | Page: 146\rInvite opposing views. So if you think others may be hesitant, make it clear that you want to hear their views—no matter how different. If others disagree, so much the better.\nYellow highlight | Page: 147\r“Does anyone see it differently?” “What am I missing here?” “I’d\nYellow highlight | Page: 147\rreally like to hear the other side of this story.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 147\rMean it. Sometimes people offer an invitation that sounds more like a threat than a legitimate call for opinions. “Well, that’s how I see it. Nobody disagrees, do they?”\nYellow highlight | Page: 147\rPlay devil’s advocate. Occasionally you can tell that others are not buying into your facts or story, but they’re not speaking up either. You’ve sincerely invited them, even encouraged differing views, but nobody says anything. To help grease the skids, play devil’s advocate. Model disagreeing by disagreeing with your own view. “Maybe I’m wrong here. What if the opposite is true? What if the reason sales have dropped is because\nYellow highlight | Page: 148\rIt’s just that it might help put my mind to rest if we were to check on this right now.\nYellow highlight | Page: 150\rIt starts with a story. When we feel the need to push our ideas on others, it’s generally because we believe we’re right and everyone else is wrong. There’s no need to expand the pool of meaning, because we own the pool. We also firmly believe it’s our duty to fight for the truth that we’re holding. It’s the honorable thing to do. It’s what people of character do.\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rWe use debating tricks that we’ve picked up throughout the years. Chief among them is the ability to “stack the deck.” We cite information that supports our ideas while hiding or discrediting anything that doesn’t.\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rThen we spice things up with exaggeration: “Everyone knows that this is the only way to go.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rWhen this doesn’t work, we lace our language with inflammatory terms: “All right-thinking people would agree with me.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rWe appeal to authority: “Well, that’s what the boss thinks.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rWe draw hasty generalizations:\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rAnd again, the harder we try and the more forceful and nasty our tactics, the greater the resistance we create, the worse the results, and the more battered our relationships.\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rWhen you find yourself just dying to convince others that your way is best, back off your current attack and think about what you really want for yourself, others, and the relationship. Then ask yourself, “How would I behave if these were the results I really wanted?” When your adrenaline level gets below the 0.05 legal limit, you’ll be able to use your STATE skills.\nYellow highlight | Page: 152\rFirst, Learn to Look. Watch for the moment when people start to resist you—perhaps they begin to raise their volume and/or overstate the facts behind their views in reaction to your tactics—or perhaps they retreat into silence. Turn your attention away from the topic (no matter how important) and onto yourself. Are you leaning forward? Are you speaking more loudly? Are you starting to try to win? Are you speaking in lengthy monologues and using dirty tricks? Remember: The more you care about an issue, the less likely you are to be on your best behavior.\nYellow highlight | Page: 152\rOf course, this isn’t easy. Backing off when we care the most is so counterintuitive that most of us have trouble doing so. It’s not easy to soften your language when you’re positive about something. And who wants to ask for other views when you know they’re wrong? That’s positively nuts.\nYellow highlight | Page: 152\rLet’s face it. When it comes to our strongest views, passion can be our enemy. Of course, feeling strongly about something isn’t bad in and of itself. It’s okay to have strong opinions. The problem comes when we try to express them.\nYellow highlight | Page: 153\rCatch yourself. So what’s a person to do? Catch yourself before you launch into a monologue. Realize that if you’re starting to feel indignant or if you can’t figure out why others don’t buy in—after all, it’s so obvious to you—recognize that you’re starting to enter dangerous territory. Back off your harsh and conclusive language. But don’t back off your belief. Hold to your belief; merely soften your approach.\nYellow highlight | Page: 157\rwhen most people become furious, we need to become curious. Rather than respond in kind, we need to wonder what’s behind the ruckus.\nBlue highlight | Page: 157\rBut how? How can we possibly act curious when others are either attacking us or heading for cover? People who routinely seek to find out why others are feeling unsafe do so because they have learned that getting at the source of fear and discomfort is the best way to return to dialogue.\nYellow highlight | Page: 157\rEither they’ve seen others do it or they’ve stumbled on the formula themselves. Either way, they realize that the cure to silence or violence isn’t to respond in kind, but to get at the underlying source. This calls for genuine curiosity—at a time when you’re likely to be feeling frustrated or angry.\nBlue highlight | Page: 158\rStay curious. When people begin to share their volatile stories and feelings, we now face the risk of pulling out our own Victim, Villain, and Helpless Stories to help us explain why they’re saying what they’re saying. Unfortunately, since it’s rarely fun to hear other people’s unflattering stories, we begin to assign negative motives to them for telling the stories. For example:\nBlue highlight | Page: 159\rTo avoid overreacting to others’ stories, stay curious. Give your brain a problem to stay focused on. Ask: “Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person say this?” This question keeps you retracing the other person’s Path to Action until you see how it all fits together. And in most\nBlue highlight | Page: 159\rBe patient. When others are acting out their feelings and opinions through silence or violence, it’s a good bet they’re starting to feel the effects of adrenaline. Even if we do our best to safely and effectively respond to the other person’s verbal attack, we still have to face up to the fact that it’s going to take a little while for him or her to settle down. Say, for example, that a friend dumps out an ugly story and you treat it with respect and continue on with the conversation. Even if the two of you now share a similar view, it may seem like your friend is still pushing too hard. While it’s natural to move quickly from one thought to the next, strong emotions take a while to subside. Once the chemicals that fuel emotions are released, they hang around in the bloodstream for a time—in some cases, long after thoughts have changed.\nBlue highlight | Page: 159\rSo be patient when exploring how others think and feel. Encourage them to share their path and then wait for their emotions to catch up with the safety that you’ve created.\nYellow highlight | Page: 159\rOnce you’ve decided to maintain a curious approach, it’s time to help the other person retrace his or her Path to Action. Unfortunately, most of us fail to do so. That’s because when others start playing silence or violence games, we’re joining the conversation at the end of their Path to Action. They’ve seen and heard things, told themselves a story or two, generated a feeling (possibly a mix of fear and anger or disappointment), and now they’re starting to act out their story. That’s where we come in. Now, even though we may be hearing their first words, we’re coming in somewhere near the end of their path. On the Path to\nYellow highlight | Page: 160\rEvery sentence has a history.\nBlue highlight | Page: 161\rBreak the cycle. And then guess what happens? When we’re on the receiving end of someone’s retributions, accusations, and cheap shots, rarely do we think: “My, what an interesting story he or she must have told. What do you suppose led to that?” Instead, we match this unhealthy behavior. Our genetically shaped, eons-old defense mechanisms kick in, and we create our own hasty and ugly Path to Action.\nYellow highlight | Page: 161\rOur genetically shaped, eons-old defense\nYellow highlight | Page: 161\rmechanisms kick in, and we create our own hasty and ugly Path to Action.\nYellow highlight | Page: 161\rknee-jerk reactions\nBlue highlight | Page: 163\r“What’s going on?” “I’d really like to hear your opinion on this.” “Please let me know if you see it differently.” “Don’t worry about hurting my feelings.

[Mirror] I really would like to hear what makes you think I’m trying to control your life. [Ask]\nBlue highlight | Page: 170\rAs you watch families and work groups take part in heated debates, it’s common to notice a rather intriguing phenomenon. Although the various parties you’re observing are violently arguing, in truth, they’re in violent agreement. They actually agree on every important point, but they’re still fighting. They’ve found a way to turn subtle differences into a raging debate.\nBlue highlight | Page: 171\rMost arguments consist of battles over the 5 to 10 percent of the facts and stories that people disagree over. And while it’s true that people eventually need to work through differences, you shouldn’t start there. Start with an area of agreement.\nBlue highlight | Page: 171\rSo here’s the take-away. If you completely agree with the other person’s path, say so and move on. Agree when you agree. Don’t turn an agreement into an argument.\nBlue highlight | Page: 171\rOf course, the reason most of us turn agreements into debates is because we disagree with a certain portion of what the other person has said. Never mind that it’s a minor portion. If it’s a point of disagreement, we’ll jump all over it like a fleeing criminal.\nBlue highlight | Page: 171\rit first is even better. And of course, having it first after others are wrong endows you with an even greater glory! Over time you find that finding even the tiniest of errors in others’ facts, thinking, or logic reinforces your supreme place in the spotlight of teacher and peer admiration. So you point out their errors. Being right at the expense of others becomes skillful sport.\nBlue highlight | Page: 171\rOn the other hand, when you watch people who are skilled in dialogue, it becomes clear that they’re not playing this everyday game of Trivial Pursuit—looking for trivial differences and then proclaiming them aloud. In fact, they’re looking for points of agreement. As a result, they’ll often start with the words “I agree.” Then they talk about the part they agree with. At least, that’s where they start.\nBlue highlight | Page: 172\rNow when the other person has merely left out an element of the argument, skilled people will agree and then build. Rather than saying: “Wrong. You forgot to mention . . .,” they say: “Absolutely. In addition, I noticed that. .\nBlue highlight | Page: 172\rIf you agree with what has been said but the information is incomplete, build. Point out areas of agreement, and\nBlue highlight | Page: 172\rthen add elements that were left out of the discussion.\nBlue highlight | Page: 172\rFinally, if you do disagree, compare your path with the other person’s. That is, rather than suggesting that he or she is wrong, suggest that you differ. He or she may, in fact, be wrong, but you don’t know for sure until you hear both sides of the story. For now, you just know that the two of you differ. So instead of pronouncing “Wrong!” start with a tentative but candid opening, such as “I think I see things differently. Let me describe how.”\nBlue highlight | Page: 172\rIn summary, to help remember these skills, think of your ABCs. Agree when you agree. Build when others leave out key pieces. Compare when you differ. Don’t turn differences into debates that lead to unhealthy relationships and bad results.\nBlue highlight | Page: 178\rThey have unclear expectations about how decisions will be made.\nBlue highlight | Page: 178\r• They do a poor job of acting on the decisions they do make. This\nBlue highlight | Page: 179\rBoth of these problems are solved if, before making a decision, the people involved decide how to decide. Don’t allow people to assume that dialogue is decision making. Dialogue is a process for getting all relevant meaning into a shared pool. That process, of course, involves everyone. However, simply because everyone is allowed to share their meaning—actually encouraged to share their meaning—doesn’t mean they are then guaranteed to take part in making all the decisions. To avoid violated expectations, separate dialogue from decision making. Make it clear how decisions will be made—who will be involved and why.\nBlue highlight | Page: 179\rWhen the line of authority isn’t clear. When there is no clear line of authority, deciding how to decide can be quite difficult.\nBlue highlight | Page: 180\rDon’t mention lawyers or a lawsuit in your opening comments; this only reduces safety and sets up an adversarial climate.\nBlue highlight | Page: 180\rThere are four common ways of making decisions: command, consult, vote, and consensus.\nBlue highlight | Page: 181\rConsulting is a process whereby decision makers invite others to influence them before they make their choice.\nBlue highlight | Page: 182\rConsensus This method can be both a great blessing and a frustrating curse. Consensus means you talk until everyone honestly agrees to one decision. This method can produce tremendous unity and high-quality decisions. If misapplied, it can also be a horrible waste of time. It should only be used with (1) high-stakes and complex issues or (2) issues where everyone absolutely must support the final choice.\nBlue highlight | Page: 184\rBe sure to spell out the exact deliverables you have in mind. The fuzzier the expectations, the higher the likelihood of disappointment.\nBlue highlight | Page: 185\rassignment, clarify up front the exact details of what you want. Couples get into trouble in this area when one of the parties doesn’t want to take the time to think carefully about the “deliverables” and then later on becomes upset because his or her unstated desires weren’t met. Have you ever remodeled a room with a loved one? Then you know what we’re talking about. Better to spend the time up front clarifying exactly what you want rather than waste resources and hurt feelings on the back end.\nBlue highlight | Page: 186\rIt’s shocking how often people leave this element out of an assignment. Instead of giving a deadline, people simply point to the setting sun of “someday.” With vague or unspoken deadlines, other urgencies come up, and the assignment finds its way to the bottom of the pile, where it is soon forgotten. Assignments without deadlines are far better at producing guilt than stimulating action. Goals without deadlines aren’t goals; they’re merely directions.\nBlue highlight | Page: 186\rRemember, if you want people to feel accountable, you must give them an opportunity to account. Build an expectation for follow-up into every assignment.\nBlue highlight | Page: 186\rOnce again, a proverb comes to mind. “One dull pencil is worth six sharp minds.”\nBlue highlight | Page: 191\rWhen you feel a measure of respect for the other person, you’re ready to begin. After establishing a Mutual Purpose for the exchange, STATE your path. For example:\nBlue highlight | Page: 191\r“I’d like to talk about something that’s getting in the way of my working with you. It’s a tough issue to bring up, but I think it’ll help us be better teammates if I do. Is that okay?” [Establish Mutual Purpose]\nBlue highlight | Page: 192\rThis is generally a problem of not knowing how to STATE Your Path. When something bothers you, catch it early. Contrasting can also help. “I’m not trying to blow this out of proportion. I just want to deal with it before it gets out of hand.” Describe the specific behaviors you’ve observed.\nBlue highlight | Page: 192\rWhen spouses stop giving each other helpful feedback, they lose out on the help of a lifelong confidant and coach.

In an article largely overlooked since it was published in 2002, they described how they were able to draw website visitors’ attention to the goal of comfort merely by placing fluffy clouds on the background wallpaper of the site’s landing page. That maneuver led those visitors to assign elevated levels of importance to comfort when asked what they were looking for in a sofa. Those same visitors also became more likely to search the site for information about the comfort features of the sofas in stock and, most notably, to choose a more comfortable (and more costly) sofa as their preferred purchase.

That’s remarkable.\nYellow highlight | Page: 22\rMost of these templates relate to the principle of unexpectedness.\nYellow highlight | Page: 23\rThe surprising lesson of this story: Highly creative ads are more predictable than uncreative ones. It’s like Tolstoy’s quote: “All happy families resemble each other, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” All creative ads resemble one another, but each loser is uncreative in its own way.\nYellow highlight | Page: 23\rif creative ads consistently make use of the same basic set of templates, perhaps “creativity” can be taught.

Once again, the fifteen best ads were selected by the creative director and tested with consumers. Suddenly these novices sprouted creativity. Their ads were rated as 50 percent more creative and produced a 55 percent more positive attitude toward the products advertised. This is a stunning improvement for a two-hour investment in learning a few basic templates! It appears that there are indeed systematic ways to produce creative ideas.\nYellow highlight | Page: 24\rWHAT THIS ISRAELI research team did for advertisements is what this book does for your ideas.\nYellow highlight | Page: 24\rBut isn’t the use of a template or a checklist confining? Surely we’re not arguing that a “color by numbers” approach will yield more creative work than a blank-canvas approach? Actually, yes, that’s exactly what we’re saying. If you want to spread your ideas to other people, you should work within the confines of the rules that have allowed other ideas to succeed over time.

Humans adapt incredibly quickly to consistent patterns.\nYellow highlight | Page: 65\rOur brain is designed to be keenly aware of changes.\nYellow highlight | Page: 65\rwhen products require users to pay attention, something changes.\nYellow highlight | Page: 65\rThis chapter focuses on two essential questions: How do I get people’s attention? And, just as crucially, How do I keep it?\nYellow highlight | Page: 65\rTo understand the answers to these two questions, we have to understand two essential emotions—surprise and interest—that are commonly provoked by naturally sticky ideas.\nYellow highlight | Page: 67\rOur schemas are like guessing machines. Schemas help us predict what will happen and, consequently, how we should make decisions.\nYellow highlight | Page: 67\rEmotions are elegantly tuned to help us deal with critical situations.\nYellow highlight | Page: 67\rFor instance, a secondary effect of being angry, which was recently discovered by researchers, is that we become more certain of our judgments. When we’re angry, we know we’re right, as anyone who has been in a relationship can attest.\nYellow highlight | Page: 67\rSo if emotions have biological purposes, then what is the biological purpose of surprise? Surprise jolts us to attention. Surprise is triggered when our schemas fail, and it prepares us to understand why the failure occurred. When our guessing machines fail, surprise grabs our attention so that we can repair them for the future.\nYellow highlight | Page: 68\ra book called Unmasking the Face, Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen coined a term, “the surprise brow,” to\nYellow highlight | Page: 68\rWhen our brows go up, it widens our eyes and gives us a broader field of vision—the surprise brow is our body’s way of forcing us to see more.\nYellow highlight | Page: 68\rUnexpected ideas are more likely to stick because surprise makes us pay attention and think.\nYellow highlight | Page: 68\rSurprise can prompt us to hunt for underlying causes, to imagine other possibilities, to figure out how to avoid surprises in the future.\nYellow highlight | Page: 71\rThe emotion of surprise is designed to focus our attention on the failure, so that we can improve our guessing machines for the future.

It wasn’t enough to know the who, what, when, and where; you had to understand what it meant. And why it mattered.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 80\rWe began this chapter with two questions: How do we get people’s attention? And how do we keep it?\nBlue highlight | Page: 80\r“I also found something I had not expected—the most successful of these pieces all began with a mystery story. The authors described a state of affairs that seemed to make no sense and then invited the reader into the material as a way of solving the mystery.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 81\rMysteries are powerful, Cialdini says, because they create a need for closure. “You’ve heard of the famous Aha! experience, right?” he says. “Well, the Aha! experience is much more satisfying when it is preceded by the Huh? experience.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 81\rCialdini began to create mysteries in his own classroom, and the power of the approach quickly became clear.\nYellow highlight | Page: 81\r“Normally five to ten minutes before the scheduled end time, some students start preparing to leave. You know the signals—pencils are put away, notebooks folded, backpacks zipped up.”\nBlue highlight | Page: 82\rCialdini believes that a major benefit of teaching using mysteries is that “the process of resolving mysteries is remarkably similar to the process of science.” So, by using mysteries, teachers don’t just heighten students’ interest in the day’s material; they train them to think like scientists.\nBlue highlight | Page: 82\rMystery is created not from an unexpected moment but from an unexpected journey. We know where we’re headed—we want to solve the mystery—but we’re not sure how we’ll get there.\nBlue highlight | Page: 83\rMcKee says, “Curiosity11 is the intellectual need to answer questions and close open patterns. Story plays to this universal desire by doing the opposite, posing questions and opening situations.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 83\rIn McKee’s view, a great script is designed so that every scene is a Turning Point. “Each Turning Point hooks curiosity. The audience wonders, What will happen next? and How will it turn out?\nYellow highlight | Page: 83\rMcKee notes that the How will it turn out? question is powerful enough to keep us watching even when we know better. “Think of all the bad films you’ve sat through just to get the answer to that nagging question.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 84\rIn 1994, George Loewenstein,12 a behavioral economist at Carnegie Mellon University, provided the most comprehensive account of situational interest. It is surprisingly simple. Curiosity, he says, happens when we feel a gap in our knowledge.\nYellow highlight | Page: 84\rLoewenstein argues that gaps cause pain.\nYellow highlight | Page: 85\r“Story works by posing questions and opening situations.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 85\rPokémon cards cause kids to wonder, Which characters am I missing?\nYellow highlight | Page: 85\rOne important implication of the gap theory is that we need to open gaps before we close them. Our tendency is to tell people the facts. First, though, they must realize that they need these facts. The trick to convincing people that they need our message, according to Loewenstein, is to first highlight some specific knowledge that they’re missing. We can pose a question or puzzle that confronts people with a gap in their knowledge.\nYellow highlight | Page: 85\rWe can point out that someone else knows something they don’t. We can present them with situations that have unknown resolutions, such as elections, sports events, or mysteries. We can challenge them to predict an outcome (which creates two knowledge gaps—What will happen? and Was I right?).\nBlue highlight | Page: 85\rThey work because they tease you with something that you don’t know—in fact, something that you didn’t care about at all, until you found out that you didn’t know it. “Is my daughter strung out on one of my old prescriptions? I wonder if I ate at the restaurant with the slime?\nBlue highlight | Page: 86\rIn improving this message, we need to think about how to elicit interest rather than force-feeding facts.\nYellow highlight | Page: 87\rThis approach is inspired by the gap theory. The goal is not to summarize; it’s to make you care about knowing something, and then to tell you what you want to know.\nBlue highlight | Page: 87\rThe improvement here is driven by structure, not content. Let’s face it, this is not a particularly interesting mystery. It would never make an episode of Law \u0026amp; Order. But our minds are extremely generous when it comes to mysteries—the format is inherently appealing.\nYellow highlight | Page: 88\rThe news-teaser approach can be used with all sorts of ideas in all sorts of contexts. To make our communications more effective, we need to shift our thinking from “What information do I need to convey?” to “What questions do I want my audience to ask?”\nYellow highlight | Page: 88\rknow. One complication is that people tend to think they know a lot.\nYellow highlight | Page: 88\rIf people believe they know everything, it’s hard to make the gap theory work. Fortunately, there are strategies for combating overconfidence. For instance, Nora Ephron’s journalism teacher prevented overconfidence by causing the students’ schemas of journalism to fail. He made them commit to their preconceived ideas and then pulled the rug out from under them.\nBlue highlight | Page: 88\rMaking people commit to a prediction can help prevent overconfidence.\nYellow highlight | Page: 89\rEric Mazur, a physics professor at Harvard, came up with a pedagogical innovation known as “concept testing.” Every so often in his classes, Mazur will pose a conceptual question and then ask his students to vote publicly on the answer. The simple act of committing to an answer makes the students more engaged and more curious about the outcome.\nYellow highlight | Page: 89\rThe thirst to fill a knowledge gap—to find out who was right—can be more powerful than the thirst for slides and jungle gyms.\nYellow highlight | Page: 89\rIf curiosity arises from knowledge gaps, we might assume that when we know more, we’ll become less curious because there are fewer gaps in our knowledge.\nYellow highlight | Page: 89\rBut Loewenstein argues that the opposite is true. He says that as we gain\nYellow highlight | Page: 89\rinformation we are more and more likely to focus on what we don’t know. Someone who knows the state capitals of 17 of 50 states may be proud of her knowledge. But someone who knows 47 may be more likely to think of herself as not knowing 3 capitals.\nYellow highlight | Page: 90\rHuman-interest stories are fascinating because we know what it’s like to be human—but we don’t know what it’s like to have certain dramatic experiences.\nYellow highlight | Page: 90\rGossip is popular because we know a lot about some people but there’s some information that we lack.\nBlue highlight | Page: 91\rThe trick, Arledge said, was to give people enough context about the game so that they’d start to care.\nYellow highlight | Page: 91\rArledge intuitively made use of Loewenstein’s gap theory. How do you get people interested in a topic? You point out a gap in their knowledge. But what if they lack so much knowledge about, say, the Georgia Bulldogs, that they’ve got more of an abyss than a gap? In that case, you have to fill in enough knowledge to make the abyss into a gap.\nYellow highlight | Page: 92\rThe tool kit he developed for NCAA football stood the test of time. The way to get people to care is to provide context. Today that seems obvious, because these techniques have become ubiquitous. But this avalanche of context started because a twenty-nine-year-old wrote a memo about how to make college football more interesting.\nYellow highlight | Page: 92\rKnowledge gaps create interest. But to prove that the knowledge gaps exist, it may be necessary to highlight some knowledge first.\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\r“Here’s what you know. Now here’s what you’re missing.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\rAlternatively, you can set context so people care what comes next.\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\rUnexpected ideas, by opening a knowledge gap, tease and flirt.\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\rThey mark a big red X on something that needs to be discovered but don’t necessarily tell you how to get there.\nYellow highlight | Page: 96\rIn Kennedy’s address to Congress, he outlined a series of requests to help the United States maintain its leadership during the Cold War. He asked for funds to achieve a number of strategic goals: to establish the AID program for international development, to expand the NATO alliance, to build radio and television stations in Latin America and Southeast Asia, and to shore up civil defense.\nYellow highlight | Page: 96\rnext, the ideas give us a sudden, dramatic glimpse of how the world might unfold. And not just how but why.\nYellow highlight | Page: 96\rit’s important to remember that knowledge gaps are painful. “If people like curiosity,15 why do they work to resolve it?\nYellow highlight | Page: 97\rWhen we’re skeptical about our ability to get people’s attention, or our ability to keep people’s attention, we should draw inspiration from Kennedy and Ibuka. And, on a smaller scale, from Nora Ephron’s journalism teacher and Nordstrom’s managers. Unexpectedness, in the service of core principles, can have surprising longevity.\nYellow highlight | Page: 99\rClearly, Aesop was illustrating a universal human shortcoming. The fable would not have survived for more than 2,500 years if it didn’t reflect some profound truth about human nature.\nYellow highlight | Page: 99\rThis truth is especially sticky because of the way it was encoded. The concrete images evoked by the fable—the grapes, the fox, the dismissive comment about sour grapes—allowed its message to persist.\nYellow highlight | Page: 99\rOur favorite from medicine: “idiopathic cardiomyopathy.” “Cardiomyopathy” means something is wrong with your heart, and “idiopathic” means “we have no idea why yours isn’t working.\nBlue highlight | Page: 99\rLanguage is often abstract, but life is not abstract. Teachers teach students about battles and animals and books. Doctors repair problems with our stomachs, backs, and hearts. Companies create software, build planes, distribute newspapers; they build cars that are cheaper, faster, or fancier than last year’s. Even the most abstract business strategy must eventually show up in the tangible actions of human beings. It’s easier to understand those tangible actions than to understand an abstract strategy statement—just as it’s easier to understand a fox dissing some grapes than an abstract commentary about the human psyche.\nYellow highlight | Page: 100\rCalifornia is one of only five Mediterranean climate regions in the world. (The others are the fynbos of South Africa, the matorral of Chile, the kwongan of Australia, and, of course, the Mediterranean.)

If you want to buy environmentally precious land, Mediterranean climates give you a lot of bang for your buck.\nBlue highlight | Page: 101\rThese new strategies made sense—TNC could protect more areas than it could reach through “bucks and acres.” But they also had drawbacks. First, they were much less concrete to donors. Donors can’t “walk around on” a favorable government regulation. Second, they were also potentially demoralizing for employees—they made progress less tangible. When\nBlue highlight | Page: 101\rTNC was focused on land deals, Sweeney said, “it was easy to celebrate a deal closing, to tell everyone, ‘John and Mary got this land,’ and to pat them on the back.” These “milestone moments,” so great for morale, were harder to find in the new model. How could TNC make the new strategy more concrete?\nBlue highlight | Page: 103\rTNC named the oak savanna the Mount Hamilton Wilderness (based on its highest peak, the site of a local observatory).

He notes that these tales are characterized by lots of concrete actions, with few abstractions. Why? The ancient Greeks certainly had no problem with abstraction—this was the society that produced Plato and Aristotle, after all. Havelock believes that the stories evolved away from abstraction over time. When they were passed along from generation to generation, the more memorable concrete details survived and the abstractions evaporated.\nBlue highlight | Page: 111\rBrown Eyes, Blue Eyes\nYellow highlight | Page: 114\rNovices perceive concrete details as concrete details.

We start to suffer from the Curse of Knowledge, like the tappers in the “tappers and listeners” game. It can feel unnatural to speak concretely about subject matter we’ve known intimately for years.

Inevitably, that universal language will be concrete.\nYellow highlight | Page: 116\rWhen Boeing prepared to launch the design of the 727 passenger plane in the 1960s, its managers set a goal that was deliberately concrete: The 727 must seat 131 passengers,8 fly nonstop from Miami to New York City, and land on Runway 4-22 at La Guardia. (The 4-22 runway was chosen for its length—less than a mile, which was much too short for any of the existing passenger jets.)\nYellow highlight | Page: 116\rWith a goal this concrete, Boeing effectively coordinated the actions\nYellow highlight | Page: 116\rof thousands of experts in various aspects of engineering or manufacturing.

STOP. Reset your timer for fifteen seconds. Turn the page for the instructions for Step 2. STEP 2 INSTRUCTIONS: Write down as many white things in your refrigerator as you can think of.\nBlue highlight | Page: 120\rWhy does this happen? Because concreteness is a way of mobilizing and focusing your brain. For another example of this phenomenon, consider these two statements: (1) Think of five silly things that people have done in the world in the past ten years. (2) Think about five silly things your child has done in the past ten years.\nYellow highlight | Page: 123\rConcreteness creates a shared “turf” on which people can collaborate. Everybody in the room feels comfortable that they’re tackling the same challenge. Even experts—even the Kleiner Perkins venture capitalists, the rock stars of the technology world—benefit from concrete talk that puts them on common ground.\nYellow highlight | Page: 129\rTo be simple—to find our core message—is quite difficult. (It’s certainly worth the effort, but let’s not kid ourselves that it’s easy.) Crafting our ideas in an unexpected way takes a fair amount of effort and applied creativity. But being concrete isn’t hard, and it doesn’t require a lot of effort. The barrier is simply forgetfulness—we forget that we’re slipping into abstractspeak. We forget that other people don’t know what we know. We’re the engineers who keep flipping back to our drawings, not noticing that the assemblers just want us to follow them down to the factory floor.\nYellow highlight | Page: 138\rA person’s knowledge of details is often a good proxy for her expertise.\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rWe’ve seen that we can make our ideas more credible, on their own merits, by using compelling details or by using statistics.\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rIt’s the Sinatra Test: If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. Safexpress, a family-owned business\nYellow highlight | Page: 153\rFor an example that unites all three of the “internal credibility” sources—details, statistics, and the Sinatra Test—we can turn to Bill McDonough, an\nYellow highlight | Page: 155\rSo far we’ve talked about creating credibility by drawing on external sources—authorities and antiauthorities. And we’ve talked about creating credibility by drawing on sources inside the message itself—by using details and statistics and examples that pass the Sinatra Test. But there’s one remaining source of credibility that we haven’t discussed. And it may be the most powerful source of all.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rThe ads were a refreshing departure from the standard advertiser tool kit that attempts to paint powerful but irrelevant emotions on consumer goods—for instance, associating a mother’s love of her children with a particular brand of fabric softener.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rWendy’s did something more admirable: It highlighted a genuine advantage of its product and presented it in an enjoyable way.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rthe commercials developed a brand-new source of credibility: the audience. Wendy’s outsourced its credibility to its customers.\nYellow highlight | Page: 157\rThe spots implicitly challenged customers to verify Wendy’s claims: See for yourself—look at our burgers versus McDonald’s burgers. You’ll notice the size difference!\nYellow highlight | Page: 157\rTestable credentials can provide an enormous credibility boost, since they essentially allow your audience members to “try before they buy.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 157\rbait-and-switch version of “Where’s the Beef?”\nYellow highlight | Page: 158\rTestable credentials are useful in many domains. For example, take the question “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?” Ronald Reagan famously posed this question to the audience during his 1980 presidential debate with Jimmy Carter.\nYellow highlight | Page: 158\rThe mission of the PCA is to emphasize that youth sports should not be about winning at all costs; it should be about learning life lessons.\nYellow highlight | Page: 159\rObserving their own behavior, the coaches learn the lesson—how they found it easier to criticize than to support, to think of ten clever insults rather than a single consolation.\nYellow highlight | Page: 159\rThompson found a way to transform his point into a testable credential, something the coaches could experience for themselves.\nYellow highlight | Page: 160\revent, to judge the event’s probability by its availability in our memory.\nYellow highlight | Page: 160\rWe intuitively think that events are more likely when they are easier to remember. But often the things we remember are not an accurate summary of the world.\nYellow highlight | Page: 163\rBut what’s more likely to stick with someone: hearing about someone who fooled someone else, or being fooled yourself?\nYellow highlight | Page: 163\rIt’s not always obvious which wellspring of credibility we should draw from. What Marshall showed so brilliantly was perseverance—knowing when it was time to draw on a different well. In this chapter we’ve seen that the most obvious sources of credibility—external validation and statistics—aren’t always the best. A few vivid\nYellow highlight | Page: 164\rdetails might be more persuasive than a barrage of statistics. An antiauthority might work better than an authority. A single story that passes the Sinatra Test might overcome a mountain of skepticism. It’s inspirational to know that a medical genius like Marshall had to climb over the same hurdles with his idea as we’ll have to climb with ours—and to see that he eventually prevailed, to the benefit of us all.\nYellow highlight | Page: 167\rThe researchers theorized that thinking about statistics shifts people into a more analytical frame of mind. When people think analytically, they’re less likely to think emotionally. And the researchers believed it was people’s emotional response to Rokia’s plight that led them to act.\nYellow highlight | Page: 167\rWhen people were primed to feel before they read about Rokia, they gave $2.34, about the same as before. But when they were primed to calculate before they read about Rokia, they gave $1.26.\nYellow highlight | Page: 167\rThese results are shocking. The mere act of calculation reduced people’s charity. Once we put on our analytical hat, we react to emotional appeals differently. We hinder our ability to feel.\nYellow highlight | Page: 168\rIN THE LAST chapter, we discussed how to convince people that our ideas are credible, how to make them believe. Belief counts for a lot, but belief isn’t enough. For people to take action, they have to care.\nYellow highlight | Page: 169\rRather, the goal of making messages “emotional” is to make people care. Feelings inspire people to act.\nYellow highlight | Page: 171\rThe Truth campaign isn’t about rational decision-making; it’s about rebellion. And it made a lot of teens care enough to do something. In this case, that something was nothing.\nYellow highlight | Page: 171\rIn fact, many ideas use a sort of piggybacking strategy, associating themselves with emotions5 that already exist.\nYellow highlight | Page: 172\rThe movie questions the existence of absolute truth—or, at least, our ability to uncover it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 172\rFrom Einstein’s view, things don’t look unpredictable; they look surprisingly orderly.\nYellow highlight | Page: 176\rThey called it Honoring the Game.

Does any teacher doubt that students would pay more attention?\nYellow highlight | Page: 180\rIf you’ve got self-interest on your side, don’t bury it. Don’t talk around it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 180\rIt’s important, Caples says, to keep the self in self-interest: “Don’t say, ‘People will enjoy12 a sense of security when they use Goodyear Tires.’ Say, ‘You enjoy a sense of security when you use Goodyear Tires.’\nYellow highlight | Page: 181\ravoid talking about abstract benefits (“People will enjoy a sense of security when they use Goodyear Tires”) and focus on personal benefits (“You enjoy a sense of security when you use Goodyear Tires”).\nYellow highlight | Page: 181\rThe Arizona study, though, took it a step further.

Principles—equality, individualism, ideals about government, human rights, and the like—may matter to us even when they violate our immediate self-interest.\nYellow highlight | Page: 189\rAnd perhaps the most important part of the story is this: “Group interest” is often a better predictor of political opinions than self-interest. Kinder says that in forming opinions people seem to ask not “What’s in it for me?” but, rather, “What’s in it for my group?” Our group affiliation may be based on race, class, religion, gender, region, political party, industry, or countless other dimensions of difference.\nYellow highlight | Page: 190\rThis model is the standard view of decision-making in economics classes: People are self-interested and rational.\nYellow highlight | Page: 190\rThe second model is quite different. It assumes that people make decisions based on identity. They ask themselves three questions: Who am I? What kind of situation is this?\nYellow highlight | Page: 190\rAnd what do people like me do in this kind of situation?\nYellow highlight | Page: 190\rThere are no calculations, only norms and principles. Which sofa would someone like me—a Southeastern accountant—be more likely to buy? Which political candidate should a Hollywood Buddhist get behind?\nYellow highlight | Page: 191\rBut from the perspective of the identity model of decision-making, turning down the popper makes perfect sense. The thought process would be more like this: “I’m a firefighter. You’re offering me a popcorn popper to get me to view a film on safety. But firefighters aren’t the kind of people who need little gifts to motivate us to learn about safety. We risk our lives, going into burning buildings to save people. Shame on you for implying that I need a popcorn popper!”\nYellow highlight | Page: 191\rto unite these two decision models. What if the marketer had offered to donate fifty dollars to a school’s fire-safety program in exchange for the firemen’s viewing the film? It’s less clear that this offer would have violated the firefighters’ sense of identity.\nYellow highlight | Page: 191\rWhat should a Pegasus person do in this situation?\nYellow highlight | Page: 194\rbotched\nYellow highlight | Page: 199\rarticulate\nNote:goko word\nYellow highlight | Page: 199\rrefine the core mission of their organization.

Think about the students who missed both a fantastic lecture and a great film because they couldn’t decide which one was better, or how hard it was for Jeff Hawkins, the leader of the Palm Pilot development group, to get his team to focus on a few issues rather than on many. To beat decision paralysis, communicators have to do the hard work of finding the core.\nYellow highlight | Page: 244\rThe archvillain of sticky ideas, as you know by now, is the Curse of Knowledge. The Stanford students didn’t face the Curse of Knowledge\nYellow highlight | Page: 244\rthem—they were more akin to reporters trying to avoid burying the lead on a news story than to experts who have forgotten what it’s like not to know something.\nYellow highlight | Page: 244\rThe Curse of Knowledge is a worthy adversary, because in some sense it’s inevitable. Getting a message across has two stages: the Answer stage and the Telling Others stage. In the Answer stage, you use your expertise to arrive at the idea that you want to share. Doctors study for a decade to be capable of giving the Answer. Business managers may deliberate for months to arrive at the Answer.\nYellow highlight | Page: 245\rHere’s the rub: The same factors that worked to your advantage in the Answer stage will backfire on you during the Telling Others stage. To get the Answer, you need expertise, but you can’t dissociate expertise from the Curse of Knowledge. You know things that others don’t know, and you can’t remember what it was like not to know those things. So when you get around to sharing the Answer, you’ll tend to communicate as if your audience were you.\nYellow highlight | Page: 245\rThere is a curious disconnect between the amount of time we invest in training people how to arrive at the Answer and the amount of time we invest in training them how to Tell Others.\nNote:made a good point\nYellow highlight | Page: 245\rCollege professors take dozens of courses in their areas of expertise but none on how to teach.\nYellow highlight | Page: 245\rA lot of engineers would scoff at a training program about Telling Others.\nYellow highlight | Page: 245\rclicked through a PowerPoint\nYellow highlight | Page: 245\rIf they’re good speakers, they may even have created an enhanced sense,\nYellow highlight | Page: 246\rThey’ve shared data, but they haven’t created ideas that are useful and lasting.

This is the one dimension of your internal world that can help you get into the right charismatic mental state at will, and almost instantly.\nYellow highlight | Location: 423\rThe placebo effect is the basis for many of the best charisma-enhancing techniques,\nYellow highlight | Location: 436\rWhen you exhibit presence, those around you feel listened to, respected, and valued.\nYellow highlight | Location: 438\rexhibit presence, power, and warmth—you must display charismatic body language.\nYellow highlight | Location: 440\rby creating a charismatic internal state your body language will authentically display charisma.\nYellow highlight | Location: 441\rcritical. Get the internal state right, and the right charismatic behaviors and body language will pour forth automatically.\nYellow highlight | Location: 472\rIn fact, that’s probably exactly what will happen, because most of us tend to interpret events—whether they’re personal or impersonal—as relating to us.\nYellow highlight | Location: 475\rWhen interacting with someone, assume that he or she will feel (at least on a subconscious level) that whatever you do relates to him or to her.\nYellow highlight | Location: 482\rPrevent Recognize Remedy or explain\nYellow highlight | Location: 484\r“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”\nYellow highlight | Location: 492\r(this means you can take deep belly breaths, not shallow chest breaths). How well you breathe affects how much oxygen gets to your brain, and therefore how well you perform mentally.\nYellow highlight | Location: 524\rFor many of us, a state of doubt or uncertainty is an uncomfortable place to be.\nYellow highlight | Location: 526\rOur inability to tolerate uncertainty carries multiple costs.\nYellow highlight | Location: 529\rAnxiety is a serious drawback to charisma. First, it impacts our internal state: quite obviously, it’s hard to be fully present while you’re feeling anxious. Anxiety can also lower our confidence. Anxiety, low presence, and low confidence can show up directly in our body language, as well as reduce our ability to emanate warmth.\nYellow highlight | Location: 531\rYet if there’s one thing that’s certain, it’s that uncertainty isn’t going away.\nYellow highlight | Location: 533\rThose who are better at handling it will gain a distinctive advantage over others.\nYellow highlight | Location: 537\rBut how many of us have felt our minds going over the different outcomes again and again, rehashing the various plans we’ve made, replaying possible scenarios, mentally rehearsing the upcoming conversations not just once or twice but ad nauseam?\nYellow highlight | Location: 547\rThe reason Tom couldn’t let go is that our minds are fundamentally uncomfortable with uncertainty.\nYellow highlight | Location: 548\rThe minute our brain registers ambiguity, it flashes an error signal. Uncertainty registers as a tension: something that must be corrected before we can feel comfortable again.\nPink highlight | Location: 549\rOur natural discomfort with uncertainty is yet another legacy of our survival instincts. We tend to be more comfortable with what is familiar, which obviously hasn’t killed us yet, than with what is unknown or uncertain, which could turn out to be dangerous.\nYellow highlight | Location: 552\rthe ability to be comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity turns out to be one of the strongest predictors of success in business.\nYellow highlight | Location: 558\rThe single most effective technique I’ve found to alleviate the discomfort of uncertainty is the responsibility transfer.\nYellow highlight | Location: 577\rIf you did feel something happen, fantastic: you’ve just performed a responsibility transfer.\nYellow highlight | Location: 580\rThe reason this technique works is that when presented with a scenario, our brain’s first reaction is to consider it as possible.\nYellow highlight | Location: 585\rmay last only a brief moment, it’s enough to produce an emotional and physical reassurance,\nYellow highlight | Location: 591\rHowever, the responsibility transfer works without trying to negate uncertainty. Instead, it helps you to be less affected by it, drawing you out of the negative mental and physical states that often accompany a position of not knowing.\nYellow highlight | Location: 593\rBy presenting your mind with the possibility that responsibility has been transferred, you’re putting to good use the wonderful placebo effect—the brain’s inability to distinguish between imagination and reality.\nYellow highlight | Location: 603\rPersonally, I’ve chosen to believe in a benevolent Universe, which has a grand master plan for me (and for everything else).\nYellow highlight | Location: 605\rperform a quick visualization to transfer responsibility. It’s amazing to feel the instant sense of relief and the warmth, calm, and serenity rising. I feel my whole body relax, and it’s as if my whole being starts to glow.\nYellow highlight | Location: 607\rDissatisfaction Caused by Comparison\nYellow highlight | Location: 611\rHuman beings are by nature driven to compare.\nYellow highlight | Location: 614\rThe very act of comparing and evaluating hinders our ability to be fully present.\nYellow highlight | Location: 616\rAnd a negative evaluation can easily put us in a negative mental state, such as dissatisfaction, envy, or resentment.\nYellow highlight | Location: 623\rFew things impact people’s performance more than how they feel about themselves.\nYellow highlight | Location: 624\rAthletes will tell you that a bad mental state will affect their performance no matter how well prepared they are physically. Psychological negativity can have real physical consequences.\nPink highlight | Location: 625\rWhen our internal voice starts criticizing us, lashing out, it can feel like we’re under attack. Because our brain doesn’t distinguish between imagination and reality, these internal attacks are perceived by our mind just as a real, physical attack would be, and they can generate an automatic physical reaction known as the threat response or fight-or-flight response.\nPink highlight | Location: 628\rThe effects of this activation are well-known. Just as a zebra reacts to the stress of being chased by a lion, the human body shoots adrenaline and cortisol (stress hormones) through its veins, and directs all its resources toward crucial functions: elevated heart and breathing rates, muscle reaction, vision acuity, and so forth. The body is no longer concerned with living ten more years, but with surviving ten more minutes. It shuts down nonurgent functions such as muscle repair, digestion, and the immune system,\nYellow highlight | Location: 633\rIn other words, because it’s not critical to survival, intelligent thinking gets shut down.\nPink highlight | Location: 633\rDavid Rock, founder of the NeuroLeadership Institute, explains that “the threat response impairs analytic thinking, creative insight, and problem solving.”7 This kind of negativity doesn’t just affect our actual performance, it also affects how others perceive us.\nYellow highlight | Location: 639\rNo matter how brief that negative expression, the person facing you is going to spot it. And all they know is that while you were looking at them and listening to them, a negative expression crossed your face. Naturally they’ll assume that expression was a reaction to them—what they said or did, or what you thought about them. This is how internal negativity affects your body language, and thus your charisma, in addition to your performance.\nYellow highlight | Location: 642\rSelf-criticism is one of the most common obstacles to great performance in any field.\nYellow highlight | Location: 646\r“Eighty percent of my day is spent fighting my inner critic.”\nYellow highlight | Location: 650\renough. In one of the manifestations of self-doubt, known as the impostor syndrome, competent people feel they don’t really know what they’re doing and are just waiting for someone to expose them as a fraud.\nYellow highlight | Location: 654\rBut already, just knowing the universality of such feelings can help us neutralize their effect and reduce their power.\nYellow highlight | Location: 668\rThe difficult feelings we experience are a natural by-product of one of our most useful survival mechanisms.\nYellow highlight | Location: 669\rFeelings like fear or anxiety are designed to get you to do something. They’re uncomfortable because they’re “designed” to be uncomfortable.\nYellow highlight | Location: 706\rFeeling internal discomfort and negativity is a natural part of life. Everyone experiences it.\nYellow highlight | Location: 713\rwe feel they “shouldn’t” be happening. So not only do we feel bad, we then also feel bad about feeling bad.\nYellow highlight | Location: 735\rThe brain equates social needs with survival; being hungry and being ostracized activate similar neural responses.1 Somewhere in the back of our minds is the fear of being so disapproved-of that we’d be excluded by those who matter to our survival.\nYellow highlight | Location: 740\rthat the tendency to feel bad about feeling bad is especially true for good people.\nYellow highlight | Location: 767\rwhatever I’ve seen may well be the sign of how they’re feeling about themselves, an itchy wool suit, or something else entirely.\nYellow highlight | Location: 784\rreality. But sometimes our mind will present us with a seriously distorted view of reality. And the distortion often skews negative because the elements that our danger-focused brain deems important\nYellow highlight | Location: 785\rare usually the most negative ones. This tendency is called the negativity bias, and\nYellow highlight | Location: 798\rWhen your brain spins negative scenarios, remind yourself that you may not be getting an accurate perception of reality.\nYellow highlight | Location: 810\rfailure is seldom fatal, and just realizing that even the worst-case scenario is survivable can bolster your confidence.\nYellow highlight | Location: 830\rthoughts. We want to avoid falling into the trap of arguing with them or trying to suppress them.\nYellow highlight | Location: 837\rBecause trying to suppress a self-critical thought only makes it more central to your thinking, it’s a far better strategy to simply aim to neutralize it.\nYellow highlight | Location: 850\rOnce the fight-or-flight response is aroused, it’s hard to quiet down.\nYellow highlight | Location: 852\rIf you aimed to simply suppress the anger, you would pay a high price.\nYellow highlight | Location: 854\rBut what if you happened to learn that this apparently reckless driver was actually a distraught mother whose baby was choking in the backseat, and she was desperately trying to pull over into the breakdown lane while reaching back to save her baby’s life?\nYellow highlight | Location: 857\rDeciding to change your belief about what happened (technically called cognitive reappraisal) effectively decreases the brain’s stress levels.\nYellow highlight | Location: 859\rThe researchers concluded that deciding to change beliefs was a far more effective and healthier solution than attempting to repress or ignore emotions.4 In most situations, we don’t know for certain what motivates a person’s actions, so we might as well choose the explanation that is most helpful to us and create a version of events that gets us into the specific mental state we need for charisma.\nYellow highlight | Location: 863\rfirst, choosing to rewrite your perception of reality is actually the rational and smart thing to do.\nYellow highlight | Location: 864\rIt can help you get back into the right mental state to emanate charismatic body language and can improve\nYellow highlight | Location: 875\rWhat if this unfortunate, unpleasant experience is absolutely perfect just as it is—the insomnia, the nausea, the fact that this is happening the very night before a high-profile assignment?\nYellow highlight | Location: 876\rIn what way can this turn out to be absolutely perfect for me?\nYellow highlight | Location: 890\r“I decide to interpret everything favorably toward myself.\nYellow highlight | Location: 890\rIt’s not just that I’m optimistic, I’m actually conveniently deluded.”\nYellow highlight | Location: 891\rOnce again, we can thank the brain’s tendency to accept imagination as reality.\nYellow highlight | Location: 894\rrather than trying to suppress or ignore your internal difficulties, consider a few alternate versions of reality. Conjure a few different scenarios that would induce\nYellow highlight | Location: 904\rWas this pleasant? Definitely not. Effective? Absolutely. Within one month, I was able to\nYellow highlight | Location: 930\radages: “Resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die.”\nYellow highlight | Location: 955\rBy using these two exercises, rewriting reality and getting satisfaction, you can choose your perception of the situation—one that allows you to be both effective and charismatic.\nYellow highlight | Location: 958\rdestigmatize discomfort, neutralize negativity, and rewrite reality.\nYellow highlight | Location: 989\rBeing comfortable with discomfort.\nYellow highlight | Location: 996\rThe answer, surprisingly, is to delve into those very sensations of discomfort. That’s right. Though it sounds counterintuitive, rather than trying to suppress, ignore, or power through them, your goal is to give your full attention to the very sensations you’d instinctively want to push away.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,000\rIn fact, this technique, called delving into sensations, can help you access charismatic presence even during highly uncomfortable situations.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,029\rAs far as his charisma was concerned, the energy he was using to try to suppress his impatience was only making things worse.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,035\rThe ability to handle discomfort is a highly valuable skill. The less discomfort affects you, the fewer the situations that can impair your charisma potential.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,038\r“the most effective thing you can do for your career is to get comfortable being uncomfortable.”\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,040\rI’ve often heard professional negotiators tell me that they could accurately predict the outcome of negotiations fairly early on using one simple clue: whoever has less endurance for silence loses.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,057\rRemind yourself that you’re not doing anything illegal! The only thing that’s holding you back is social customs. You can\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,060\rpractice. So if you can bring yourself to talk to strangers whenever you’re waiting around in lines, or on buses or trains, do it. Grab every opportunity, and you’ll improve fast.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,086\rGolfer Jack Nicklaus said that he never hit a shot, even during practice, without visualizing it first.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,088\r“There is good evidence that imagining oneself performing an activity activates parts of the brain that are used in actually performing the activity,”\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,102\rIf their internal emotions were not what they wanted the outside world to see, sooner or later, something of these underlying thoughts and feelings would show.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,106\rBecause of its powerful mental and physiological effects, visualization is one of the most effective charisma-boosting tools available.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,108\rJust by using the right mental images, your subconscious mind will send a remarkable chain reaction of confidence signals cascading through your body. In fact, you can display nearly any body language just by picking the right visualization.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,123\rThe next time you do this exercise, aim to create images that are even more detailed. Guided imagery must be precise, vivid, and detailed to be effective, says Harvard-trained visualization specialist Stephen Krauss. When visualization is used with Olympic ski teams, skiers visualize themselves careening through the entire course, feeling their muscles tensing, experiencing each bump and turn in their minds.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,151\rVisualization is truly a miracle method, helping you boost confidence, emanate more warmth, replace anxiety with calm serenity, or gain access to whichever emotion you’d like to feel and then broadcast it through your body language.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,175\rI’ve even found visualization helpful before writing important e-mails. Just as the right visualization helps you get into the right body language so that the right signals flow effortlessly, you can use visualization to get into specific emotional or mental states so that the right words flow as well.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,182\rOne of my favorite neuroscience resources, the Wise Brain Bulletin, suggested\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,192\r“Every night… I held an imaginary council meeting with this group whom I called my ‘Invisible Counselors.’… I now\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,218\rGratitude is a great antidote to all of these negative feelings because it comes from thinking of things you already have—from material items or experiences to cherished relationships.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,220\rGratitude can be a great charisma conduit, bringing you back to the present and giving you immediate access to feelings of both confidence and warmth.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,222\rgratitude helps you live longer, healthier, and even happier.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,230\rDuring a recent lunch meeting at a restaurant, for instance, I focused on little delights: the sun streaming through the window; blue skies; that the waiter got my order right; or the existence, availability, and wonders of ketchup.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,297\rWhen our only aim is to broadcast goodwill, it takes the pressure off. We’re no longer striving, struggling, pushing for things to go in a certain direction.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,298\rAnd since we’re less concerned about how the interaction goes, we can both feel and project more charismatic confidence.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,303\rOne simple but effective way to start is to try to find three things you like about the person you want to feel goodwill toward.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,308\rFirst, a visualization. This one comes from neuroscientist Dr. Privahini Bradoo,\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,309\rimagine the person you’re speaking to, and all those around you, as having invisible angel wings.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,316\rIf you respond better to auditory guides, try a few different phrases. For instance, while looking at someone, think, I like you. And I like you just for you. Or try to remember this guideline: Just love as much as you can from wherever you are.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,319\rthe options open to me right now, which one would bring the most love into this world?\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,332\rYour willingness to focus on others’ well-being is all you need to positively change your body language.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,361\r“Why would people like me? Even I don’t find myself likable.”\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,361\rAs you can imagine, this cold internal message resonated in her head, played across her body language, and diminished how much warmth she could emanate.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,366\rSelf-confidence is our belief in our ability to do or to learn how to do something.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,367\rSelf-esteem is how much we approve of or value ourselves. It’s often a comparison-based evaluation (whether measured against other people or against our own internal standards for approval).\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,369\rSelf-compassion is how much warmth we can have for ourselves, especially when we’re going through a difficult experience.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,370\rhave high self-confidence but low self-esteem and very low self-compassion.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,373\rmay be healthier to focus on self-compassion than on self-esteem.6\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,374\rSelf-esteem is more of a roller coaster, contingent on how we believe we compare to others. It also tends to correlate with narcissism.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,375\rIndividuals who score high on self-compassion scales demonstrate greater emotional resilience to daily difficulties and fewer negative reactions to difficult situations, such as receiving unflattering feedback.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,377\rHigher self-compassion predicts a greater sense of personal responsibility for the outcome of events: it helps predict levels of accountability. People who score high on self-compassion also have a lower tendency for denial. This makes sense: personal mistakes would generate less self-criticism, so people would be more willing to admit to them.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,383\rself-compassion is feeling that what happened to you is unfortunate, whereas self-pity is feeling that what happened to you is unfair. In this way, self-pity can lead to resentment or bitterness, and to feeling more isolated and alienated. In contrast, self-compassion often leads to increased feelings of connectedness.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,394\rSelf-compassion delivers an impressive array of benefits: decreased anxiety, depression, and self-criticism; improved relationships and greater feelings of social connectedness and satisfaction with life; increased ability\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,396\rto handle negative events; and even improved immune system functioning.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,399\rKristin Neff, one of compassion’s foremost researchers,\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,400\rFirst, realizing that we’re experiencing difficulties.

The attitude was definitely not working for me, so what to do? I decided that I was a movie star incognito. I stood up straighter, shoulders back, head erect, with the posture that I imagine I would have if I were royalty. Suddenly the dress that had seemed so out of place a moment ago felt like an amazing fashion statement, something that everyone else should copy. I noticed as I walked down the street that heads were turning, all of them. When I asked a man for directions, he said he would be honored if I would allow him to show me the way. It was amazing. From one second to the next, I went from a dowdy, frumpy, ugly stranger to a head-turning movie star. It was memorable. And enlightening.\nYellow highlight | Location: 1,514\rAnd if you keep at it, you will get comfortable with it.

We must learn to think in moments, to spot the occasions that are worthy of investment.\nYellow highlight | Location: 254\rThis “moment-spotting” habit can be unnatural. In organizations, for instance, we are consumed with goals. Time is meaningful only insofar as it clarifies or measures our goals. The goal is the thing.\nYellow highlight | Location: 255\rBut for an individual human being, moments are the thing. Moments are what we remember and what we cherish.

He knew that many people become paralyzed by the fear of failure. They’re constantly afraid of what others will think if they don’t do a great job and, as a result, take no risks. My father wanted us to try everything and feel free to push the envelope. His attitude taught me to define failure as not trying something I want to do instead of not achieving the right outcome.” His question, “What did you guys fail at this week?” was a push to stretch.

This closed-mindedness is terribly costly; it causes you to miss out on all sorts of wonderful possibilities and dangerous threats that other people might be showing you—and it blocks criticism that could be constructive and even lifesaving.\nYellow highlight | Page: 187\rDifferences in thinking can be symbiotic and complementary instead of disruptive. For example, the lateral approach to thinking common among creative people can lead them to be unreliable, while more linear thinkers are often more dependable; some people are more emotional while others are more logical, and so on. None of these individuals would be able to succeed at any kind of complex project without the help of others who have complementary strengths.\nYellow highlight | Page: 187\rIn my opinion, these two barriers—ego and blind spots—are the fatal flaws that keep intelligent, hardworking people from living up to their potential.\nYellow highlight | Page: 208\rUnderstand the power that comes from knowing how you and others are wired.\nYellow highlight | Page: 209\rKay Redfield Jamison (who has written frankly about her own experiences with the disease in her book An Unquiet Mind).\nYellow highlight | Page: 209\rOnce I understood that it’s all physiological, many things became clearer to me.

Some people like to live in a planned, orderly way and others prefer flexibility and spontaneity.35 Planners (or “Judgers” in Myers-Briggs terms) like to focus on a plan and stick with it, while perceivers are prone to focus on what’s happening around them and adapt to it. Perceivers work from the outside in; they see things happening and work backward to understand the cause and how to respond; they also see many possibilities that they compare and choose from—often so many that they are confused by them. In contrast, planners work from the inside out, first figuring out what they want to achieve and then how things should unfold. Planners and perceivers have trouble appreciating each other. Perceivers see new things and change direction often. This is discomforting to planners, who weigh precedent much more heavily in their decision making, and assume if it was done in a certain way before, it should be done in the same way again. Similarly, planners can discomfort perceivers by being seemingly rigid and slow to adapt.\nYellow highlight | Page: 228\rCreators generate new ideas and original concepts.

Perhaps even more importantly, they can hold conflicting thoughts simultaneously and look at them from different angles. They typically love to knock things around with other really smart people and can easily navigate back and forth between the big picture and the granular details, counting both as equally important.\nYellow highlight | Page: 231\rNature made everything and everyone for a purpose.

You can convince the other side to be open to the principles and objective standards you suggest only if you show yourself open to the ones they suggest.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,002\r“We appreciate what you’ve done for us”\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,007\r“We have nothing against you personally.

After being praised, Mrs. Jones now has a slight emotional investment in Turnbull’s approval of her.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,011\r“Our concern is fairness”\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,014\rTurnbull takes a basic stand on principle and announces his intention to stick to it;\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,015\rhe must be persuaded on the basis of principle. At the same time, he lets Mrs. Jones know he is open to persuasion along the lines of this principle. She is thus left with little choice but to reason with him in pursuit of her interests.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,018\rHis ends, he claims, are a fair balance between rent paid and time spent.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,020\r“We would like to settle this on the basis of independent standards, not of who can do what to whom”\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,035\rBut instead of reacting, Turnbull keeps his temper and brings the negotiation back to the merits. This is a good example of negotiation jujitsu. He deflects Mrs. Jones’s attack by taking responsibility for her mistaken perceptions, and he tries to persuade her of his sincere interest in principle.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,037\rHe does not hide either his selfish interests or his leverage over her; on the contrary, he makes both explicit. Once they are acknowledged, he can distinguish them from the merits and they can cease being an issue.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,047\rhowever, by expressing his gratitude once more and then defining the question of trust as irrelevant. Turnbull at once reaffirms his appreciation of Mrs. Jones while he remains firm on the principle. In doing so, he avoids connecting the two thoughts with “but,” implicitly using “and” instead. “But,” sometimes called the “great eraser,” has a tendency to negate the first thing you say by implying that only one of two statements can be true, making it either/or. “And” underscores the more complex reality that both thoughts can be true at the same time.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,065\rAnalysis. Statements of fact can feel lecturing or threatening. Whenever you can, ask a question instead.\nNote:important\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,069\rPhrasing each piece of information as a question allows Mrs. Jones to participate, listen to the information, evaluate it, and either accept or correct it.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,070\rTurnbull communicates the same information to her but in a less provocative manner. He reduces the heat still further by attributing a particularly pointed question to his absent roommate.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,076\rA principled negotiator neither accepts nor rejects the other side’s positions.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,076\rTo keep the dialogue focused on the merits, Turnbull questions Mrs. Jones about the reasons for her position. He does not ask whether there were any reasons. He assumes there are good reasons. This flattering assumption leads the other side to search for reasons even if there are none, thus keeping the negotiation on the basis of principle.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,086\rAnalysis. Principled negotiation requires good communication. Before responding to Mrs. Jones’s arguments, Turnbull restates to her in positive terms what he has heard to make sure he has indeed understood her.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,087\rOnce she feels understood, she can relax and discuss the problem constructively.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,088\rShe can’t dismiss his arguments on the grounds that they do not take into account what she knows. She is more likely to listen now and be more receptive. In trying to sum up her point of view, Turnbull establishes a cooperative game in which both are making sure he understands the facts.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,093\rAnalysis. A good negotiator rarely makes an important decision on the spot. The psychological pressure to be nice and to give in is too great. A little time and distance help disentangle the people from the problem.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,097\rHe shows not only decisiveness but also control over the course of the negotiation.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,103\rTurnbull: Let me show you where I have trouble following some of your reasons for the extra $268 a month.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,108\rAnalysis. In principled negotiation you present your reasons first before offering a proposal. If principles come afterward, they appear not as the objective criteria that any proposal should satisfy but as mere justifications for an arbitrary position.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,110\rFor Turnbull to explain his reasons first shows his openness to persuasion and his awareness of the need to convince Mrs. Jones. If he announced his proposal first, Mrs. Jones probably would not bother to listen to the reasons that followed. Her mind would be elsewhere, considering what objections and counterproposals she could make.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,114\rIn preparing for your negotiation, it helps to think about what standards would be useful, who might be able to provide them, and how to frame your questions to elicit the most relevant information.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,116\r“One fair solution might be …”\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,120\rAnalysis. Turnbull presents a proposal not as his, but as a fair option that deserves their joint consideration.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,120\rHe does not claim it is the only fair solution, but one fair solution. He is specific without digging himself into a position and inviting rejection.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,127\rTurnbull is trying to make it easy for Mrs. Jones to say yes to his proposal. So he starts by making it clear that all it takes for the problem to go away is Mrs. Jones’s agreement.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,130\rwithout upsetting the negotiations? He bases the alternative on objective principle by attributing it to a legal authority—the hearing examiner.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,131\rHe distances himself personally from the suggestion.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,144\rIncorporating her interests into the agreement not only gives her more of a stake in it but also allows Mrs. Jones to save face.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,148\rPaul and I do appreciate, Mrs. Jones, all that you’ve done for us, and I’m pleased that we’ve settled this last problem fairly and amicably.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,194\rDon’t attack people personally for using a tactic you consider illegitimate. If they get defensive it may be more difficult for them to give up the tactic, and they may be left with a residue of anger that will fester and interfere with other issues.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,198\rDon’t be diverted from the negotiation by the urge to teach them a lesson.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,202\rInvent options for mutual gain.

The content of a possible agreement needs to be separated from questions of how you talk about it and how you deal with the other side. Each set of issues needs to be negotiated on its own merits. The following list illustrates the distinction: Substantive Issues Terms Conditions Prices Dates Numbers Liabilities Relationship Issues Balance of emotion and reason Ease of communication Degree of trust and reliability Attitude of acceptance (or rejection) Relative emphasis on persuasion (or coercion) Degree of mutual understanding People often assume that there is a trade-off between pursuing a good substantive outcome and pursuing a good relationship. We disagree. A good working relationship tends to make it easier to get good substantive outcomes (for both sides). Good substantive outcomes tend to make a good relationship even better.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,575\rOur point is that you should not give in for the purpose of trying to improve a relationship.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,587\rOur behavior should be designed to model and encourage the behavior we would prefer and to avoid any reward for the behavior we dislike, both without compromising our substantive interests.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,600\rIt is the perception that is skewed, not the response to that perception.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,601\rOn the other hand, if you inquire empathetically, taking their feelings seriously and trying to trace their reasoning to its roots, it is sometimes possible to effect change.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,603\rWorking with them, you may discover a logical leap, a factual misperception, or a traumatic association from an earlier time that, once brought to light, can be examined and modified by the people themselves.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,604\rIn essence, you are looking for the psychological interests behind their position, to help them find a way to meet more of their interests more effectively.\nYellow highlight | Location: 2,656\rA key point, worth repeating, is that negotiating does not require compromising your principles.

Even if you are perfectly content in your current job, I’d love to introduce myself and hear about your career interests.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 61\rMost people will be thrilled to chat.

When you are done with the call, assuming you were even moderately impressed with what you heard, be sure to ask the key follow-up question: “Now that you know a little about me, who are the most talented people you know who might be a good fit for my company?”\nYellow highlight | Page: 71\rIdeally, a candidate will share career goals that match your company’s needs. If he or she lacks goals or sounds like an echo of your own Web site, screen the person out. You are done with the call.

You say, “If you advance to the next step in our process, we will ask for your help in setting up some references with bosses, peers, and subordinates. Okay?” The candidate will say, “Okay.” Then you say, “So I’m curious. What do you think they will say are some things you are not good at, or not interested\nYellow highlight | Page: 72\rin?” Now you’ll get an honest and full answer.\nYellow highlight | Page: 72\rThe thought that you will be talking to references and verifying the candidate’s answers compels the candidate to be much more truthful and complete than usual. You will be amazed how much of a truth serum this technique can be at this stage of the screening interview.\nYellow highlight | Page: 73\rWho were your last five bosses, and how will they each rate your performance on a 1–10 scale when we talk to them?\nYellow highlight | Page: 75\rabout the answer by asking a follow-up question that begins with “What,” “How,” or “Tell me more.” Keep using this framework until you are clear about what the person is really saying.\nYellow highlight | Page: 81\rWhat Brad Smart discovered was the power of using data and patterns of behavior for making predictions about how somebody is likely\nYellow highlight | Page: 81\rperform in the future.\nYellow highlight | Page: 81\r“The patterns become clearer and clearer,” he told us, “so it becomes easy to get a fix on exactly what the individual’s strengths and weaknesses are today. It discloses the likelihood that a person will\nYellow highlight | Page: 81\rminimize weaker points. If the pattern is there of extracting success out of the jaws of defeat, that makes you want to hire somebody.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 83\rThis is where you will hear the stories behind the polished statements on a resume. In our experience, most\nYellow highlight | Page: 84\rcandidates naturally focus on what really mattered to them at that time in their career rather than regurgitate what they put on their resume.\nYellow highlight | Page: 84\rA Players tend to talk about outcomes linked to expectations. B and C Players talk generally about events, people they met, or aspects of the job they liked without ever getting into results.\nYellow highlight | Page: 84\rOur recommendation is to reframe the question over and over until the candidate gets the message. “What went really wrong? What was your biggest mistake? What would you have done differently? What part of the job did you not like? In what ways were\nYellow highlight | Page: 84\ryour peers stronger than you?” Don’t let the candidate off the hook. Keep pushing until the candidate shares the lows.\nYellow highlight | Page: 85\rBegin by asking candidates for their boss’s name. Ask them to spell it for you, and make a point to show them you are writing it down.\nYellow highlight | Page: 85\r“John Smith, you say? That is S, M, I, T, H, right?” Forcing candidates to spell the name out no matter how common it might be sends a powerful message: you are going to call, so they should tell the truth.\nYellow highlight | Page: 85\rNow ask, “What will Mr. Smith say were your biggest strengths and areas for improvement?” Be sure to say will, not would.\nYellow highlight | Page: 88\rA Players are highly valued by their bosses. B and C Players often are not.\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\rThank you for taking the time to visit us today. As we have already discussed, we are going to do a chronological interview to walk through each job you have held. For each job I am going to ask you five core questions: What were you hired to do?

You say, “Wow! It sounds like that pig farm next to the corporate office smelled horrible!” The candidate nods and says “Yes!” and appreciates your empathy and respect. Then you immediately say, “You were just telling me about\nYellow highlight | Page: 96\ris through maintaining very high rapport that you get the most valuable data, and polite\nYellow highlight | Page: 96\rinterrupting can build that rapport.\nYellow highlight | Page: 96\ryou can use to clarify how valuable an accomplishment was in any context.

Tell me more” framework.\nYellow highlight | Page: 122\rConduct a Who Interview of one and a half to three hours by walking chronologically through a candidate’s career, using the same five questions for each job or chapter in the person’s work history. The hiring manager and one other colleague should conduct the interview in tandem. 3. FOCUSED INVERVIEW(S): Involve others in the hiring process by assigning team members to conduct interviews that focus on the outcomes and/or competencies on the scorecard. 4. CANDIDATE DISCUSSION: Following each day of interviews, grade the scorecard using the skill-will framework. Advance those whose skill (what they are fundamentally good at doing) and will (what they want to do, and in what type of culture) match the mission, outcomes, and competencies on your scorecard. Look for people whom you would rate an A on the critical outcomes and key competencies. Nobody is perfect, but seek those who are strong in the most important places of your scorecard. 5. REFERENCE INTERVIEW: Conduct seven reference calls with people you choose from the Who Interview. Ask the candidate to set up the calls to break through the gatekeepers while minimizing your own effort. 6. FINAL DECISION: Repeat your analysis of the skill-will profile to\nYellow highlight | Page: 123\rMost managers fail to sell a candidate.\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rline.

And they assign blame to a trait—a character flaw.\nYellow highlight | Page: 153\rthere. When people blame their partner’s personality for the problem, they feel anger and disgust toward them.\nYellow highlight | Page: 154\rRelationship expert Daniel Wile says that choosing a partner is choosing a set of problems. There are no problem-free candidates. The trick is to acknowledge each other’s limitations, and build from there.\nYellow highlight | Page: 155\rIt was a problem of communication, not a problem of personality or character. Yet in the fixed mindset, the blame came fast and furious.\nYellow highlight | Page: 155\rIn the end, this marriage was saved—only because the couple learned to respond to each other not with angry labels, but with helpful actions. One day, when Karen was swamped with work, Ted came home to a messy house. He was angry and wanted to scold her, but, drawing on what he’d learned from Beck, he instead said to himself, “What is the mature thing to do?” He answered his own question by starting to clean things up. He was offering Karen support rather than judgment.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rAaron Beck tells couples in counseling never to think these fixed-mindset thoughts: My partner is incapable of change. Nothing can improve our relationship. These ideas, he says, are almost always wrong.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rBill was a permanently bad and untrustworthy husband or a man who needed a lot of help.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rYet Hillary could not have forgiven a person she saw as a liar and a cheat.

One is to blame your own permanent qualities. And one is to blame your partner’s. You can see how tempting\nYellow highlight | Page: 157\rit is to foist the blame onto the other guy.\nYellow highlight | Page: 157\rand assign blame when something in a relationship goes wrong. “It’s not my fault!” To deal with this bad habit, my husband and I invented a third party, an imaginary man named Maurice.

The rest is not really relevant since I wasn’t seeking validation, but I’ll tell you anyway.\nYellow highlight | Page: 158\rWhat allowed me to take that first step, to choose growth and risk rejection? In the fixed mindset, I had needed my blame and bitterness. It made me feel more righteous, powerful, and whole than thinking I was at fault. The growth mindset allowed me to give up the blame and move on. The growth mindset gave me a mother.\nYellow highlight | Page: 158\rIn a relationship, the growth mindset lets you rise above blame, understand the problem, and try to fix it—together.\nYellow highlight | Page: 158\rIn the fixed mindset, where you’ve got to keep proving your competence, it’s easy to get into a competition with your partner. Who’s the smarter, more talented, more likable one?\nYellow highlight | Page: 160\r“Oh no,” I replied. “To me the whole point of marriage is to encourage your partner’s development and have them encourage yours.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 161\rThis mentality can intrude on friendships.

They go out and meet new people, and, after their nerves settle down, their relationships proceed normally. The shyness doesn’t tyrannize them.\nYellow highlight | Page: 167\rIn our study, the students with the growth mindset were not as prone to see the bullying as a reflection of who they were. Instead, they saw it as a psychological problem of the bullies, a way for the bullies to gain status or charge their self-esteem: “I’d think that the reason he is bothering me is probably that he has problems at home or at school with his grades.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 168\rwould want to forgive them eventually” and “My number one goal would be to help them become better people.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 168\r“People do have the potential to change.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 169\rBullies judge. Victims take it in. Sometimes it remains inside and can lead to depression and suicide. Sometimes it explodes into violence.\nYellow highlight | Page: 170\rWhat Davis does is this. First, while enforcing consistent discipline, he doesn’t judge the bully as a person. No criticism is directed at traits. Instead, he makes them feel liked and welcome at school every day.\nYellow highlight | Page: 170\rdirection. But again, he does not praise the person; he praises their effort.\nYellow highlight | Page: 170\rnotice that you have been staying out of fights. That tells me you are working on getting along with people.” You can see that Davis is leading students directly to the growth mindset. He is helping them see their actions as part of an effort to improve. Even if the change was not intentional on the part of the bullies, they may now try to make it so.\nYellow highlight | Page: 171\rbut hopeful of forgiving, learning, and moving on? Think of the worst rejection you ever had. Get in touch with all the feelings, and see if you can view it from a growth mindset. What did you learn from it? Did it teach you something about what you want and don’t want in your life? Did it teach you some positive things that were useful in later relationships? Can you forgive that person and wish them well? Can you let go of the bitterness?\nYellow highlight | Page: 172\rProblems can be a vehicle for developing greater understanding and intimacy. Allow your partner to air his or her differences, listen carefully, and discuss them in a patient and caring manner.\nYellow highlight | Page: 172\rAre you a blamer like me? It’s not good for a relationship to pin everything on your partner. Create your own Maurice and blame him instead. Better yet, work toward curing yourself of the need to blame. Move beyond thinking about fault and blame all the time. Think of me trying to do that too.\nYellow highlight | Page: 172\rAre you shy? Then you really need the growth mindset. Even if it doesn’t cure your shyness, it will help keep it from messing up your social interactions. Next time you’re venturing into a social situation, think about these things: how social skills are things you can improve and how social interactions are for learning and enjoyment, not judgment. Keep practicing this.\nYellow highlight | Page: 173\r“I would do anything, give anything, to make my children successful.” Yet many of the things they do boomerang.

What could they have said instead? “It must be a terrible thing to feel that everyone is evaluating you and you can’t show what you know. We want you to know that we are not evaluating you. We care about your learning, and we know that you’ve learned your stuff.

For most of them, their first teachers were incredibly warm and accepting. Not that they set low standards. Not at all, but they created an atmosphere of trust, not judgment. It was, “I’m going to teach you,” not “I’m going to judge your talent.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 201\rOne of Marva Collins’s first mentors taught her the same thing—that, above all, a good teacher is one who continues to learn along with the students. And she let her students know that right up front: “Sometimes I don’t like other grown-ups very much because they think they know everything. I don’t know everything. I can learn all the time.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 202\rThe fixed mindset makes people complicated.

I never take mine off, it’s part of my outfit; (2) Peapod plus portable tent—this is baby’s main bed at home and travel so baby has the same sleep place everywhere we go, and the flaps give all travel parties privacy—great from small babies to five-year-olds. I can still jam this onto a little wheeled carry-on and\nYellow highlight | Location: 4,284\rpack mine and baby’s minimal clothing around it; (3) Go Go Kidz TravelMate (great for wheeling car seat up to the gate for gate check or use on plane); (4) Britax Diplomat car seat is small but kids can use it from birth to approx. four years old. Make sure the wheeled carry-on bag you get is one size smaller than the allowed carry-on size so you don’t get bumped to check the bag in if the plane is full. You can always nicely argue/reason/bat your eyelashes that you will put the bag in your foot space.

You will just embrace life with all your heart and soul.\nYellow highlight | Page: 48\rAs long as you are defining what you like and what you don’t like, you will open and close. You are actually defining your limits. You are allowing your mind to create triggers that open and close you.\nYellow highlight | Page: 48\rLet go of that. Dare to be different. Enjoy all of life.\nYellow highlight | Page: 52\rLife must now compete with this blocked event for your attention, and the impression does not just sit in there quietly.\nYellow highlight | Page: 53\rIn the yogic tradition, that unfinished energy pattern is called a Samskara. This is a Sanskrit word meaning “impression,” and in the yogic teachings it is considered one of the most important influences affecting your life. A Samskara is a blockage, an impression from the past. It’s an unfinished energy pattern that ends up running your life.\nYellow highlight | Page: 57\rThe alternative is to be willing to let it go when it gets stimulated. It only hurts for a minute and then it’s over.\nYellow highlight | Page: 60\rBecause most of us don’t have to worry about food, clothing, or shelter, we have the luxury of worrying about a spot on our pants, or laughing too loud, or saying something wrong. Because we’ve developed this hypersensitive psyche, we constantly use our energies to close around it and protect ourselves. But this process only hides the problems; it doesn’t fix them. You’re locking your illness inside yourself,\nYellow highlight | Page: 61\rif you protect yourself, you will never be free. It’s that simple.\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rOnce you close, you have to make sure that what you protected doesn’t get disturbed. You then carry this task for the rest of your life.\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rday. How often do you find yourself trying to protect and defend that weak part of you? You feel like the world wants to get right at it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rThe reward for not protecting your psyche is liberation. You are free to walk through this world without a problem\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rYou are just having fun experiencing whatever happens next.\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rdisturbed. You no longer have to listen to “What will they think of me?” or, “Oh God, I wish I hadn’t said that. It sounded so stupid.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rSpiritual growth is about the point at which you start to feel your energy change.\nYellow highlight | Page: 62\rFor instance, somebody says something, and you start to feel the energy get a little strange inside. You will actually start to feel a tightening. That is your cue that it’s time to grow. It’s not time to defend yourself, because you don’t want the part of you that you would be defending.\nYellow highlight | Page: 64\rThis technique of freeing yourself is done with the understanding that thoughts and emotions are just objects of consciousness.\nYellow highlight | Page: 64\rconsciousness. If you want to be free, then every time you feel any change in the energy flow, relax behind it. Don’t fight with it, don’t try to change it, and don’t judge it. Don’t say, “Oh, I can’t believe I’m still feeling this. I promised myself I wouldn’t think about that car anymore.” Don’t do that; you’ll just end up going with the guilt thoughts instead of the car thoughts. You have to let them all go.\nYellow highlight | Page: 65\rOnly you can take inner freedom away from yourself, or give it to yourself. Nobody else can.\nYellow highlight | Page: 71\rIf you have a lot of fear, you won’t like change. You’ll try to create a world around you that is predictable, controllable, and definable. You’ll try to create a world that doesn’t stimulate your fears. Fear doesn’t want to feel itself; it’s actually afraid of itself.\nYellow highlight | Page: 71\rYou can do one of two things with fear: you can recognize that you have it and work to release it, or you can keep it and try to hide from\nYellow highlight | Page: 72\rYour definitions of desirable and undesirable, as well as good and bad, all come about because you have defined how things need to be in order for you to be okay.\nYellow highlight | Page: 72\rAs you grow spiritually, you will realize that your attempts to protect yourself from your problems actually create more problems.\nYellow highlight | Page: 73\rWhen your heart is weak it becomes susceptible to lower vibrations, and one of the lowest of all vibrations is fear. Fear is the cause of every problem. It’s the root of all prejudices and the negative emotions of anger, jealousy, and possessiveness.\nYellow highlight | Page: 73\rYou’d be willing to face everything and everyone because you wouldn’t have fear inside of you that could cause you disturbance.\nYellow highlight | Page: 73\rThe purpose of spiritual evolution is to remove the blockages that cause your fear.\nYellow highlight | Page: 74\rEveryone is saying, “I will do every single thing I can to keep my stuff. If you say anything that disturbs me, I will defend myself. I’ll yell at you and make you take it back. If you cause any disturbance inside of me, I will make you so sorry.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 74\ragain. First you defend yourself, and then you protect yourself. You do whatever you can to keep from feeling disturbance.\nYellow highlight | Page: 74\rYou only have to be willing to open your heart in the face of anything and everything, and permit the purification process to take place.\nYellow highlight | Page: 76\rYour consciousness leaves the centered position of witnessing the many energies around you, and you get sucked into focusing on just one of them.\nYellow highlight | Page: 76\rThings you liked, now look dark and depressing. But nothing has really changed. It’s just that you’re looking at life from that seat of disturbance.\nYellow highlight | Page: 80\rSo don’t fall. Let go. No matter what it is, let it go. The bigger it is, the higher the reward of letting go and the worse the fall if you don’t. It’s pretty black-and-white. You either let go or you don’t. There really isn’t anything in between. So let all of your blockages and disturbances become the fuel for the journey. That which is holding you down can become a powerful force\nYellow highlight | Page: 81\rReal transformation begins when you embrace your problems as agents for growth. In order to understand how this process works, let’s examine the following situation.\nYellow highlight | Page: 88\rThis is what you begin to experience if you hang out with the Self instead of hanging out with inner disturbances.\nYellow highlight | Page: 88\rAwareness is simply aware while everything in the universe parades before it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 89\rWhen Buddha said that all of life is suffering, this is what he was referring to. People do not understand how much they are suffering because they have never experienced what it is like to not suffer.\nYellow highlight | Page: 90\rYou are either trying to stop suffering, controlling your environment to avoid suffering, or worrying about suffering in the future. This state of affairs is so prevalent that you don’t see it, just as a fish doesn’t see the water.\nYellow highlight | Page: 91\rInner sensitivity is a symptom of non-well-being. It’s the same as when the body sends pain or displays other symptoms when it’s not well.\nYellow highlight | Page: 91\rYour psyche is communicating through its universal language: fear. Self-consciousness, jealousy, insecurity, anxiety—they are all fear.\nYellow highlight | Page: 92\rWhat you’ll see is that your mind is always telling you that you have to change something outside in order to solve your inner problems. But if you are wise, you won’t play this game. You’ll realize that the advice your mind is giving you is psychologically damaged advice. Your mind’s thoughts are disturbed by its fears.\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\rThe fact is, however, external changes are not going to solve your problem because they don’t address the root of your problem. The root problem is that you don’t feel whole and complete within yourself.\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\rYou began with a problem inside yourself, and you tried to solve it by getting involved with somebody else.\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\rImagine what fun life would be if you didn’t have those neurotic, personal thoughts going on within you. You could enjoy things, and you could actually get to know people instead of needing them.\nYellow highlight | Page: 93\rYou could just live and experience your life, instead of trying to use life to fix what’s wrong inside of you. You are capable of achieving that state. It’s never too late.\nYellow highlight | Page: 95\ryour mind starts telling you what you have to do to make everything inside okay, don’t buy into what it’s\nYellow highlight | Page: 95\rThe truth is, everything will be okay as soon as you are okay with everything. And that’s the only time everything will be okay.\nYellow highlight | Page: 96\rThere are billions of people on this planet, and one of them didn’t say hello to you. Are you saying that you can’t handle that? Is that reasonable?\nYellow highlight | Page: 96\rBegin this journey to freedom by regularly reminding yourself to watch the psyche.\nYellow highlight | Page: 97\rEvery time you get into your car, as you’re settling into the seat, just stop. Take a moment to remember that you’re spinning on a planet in the middle of empty space. Then remind yourself that you’re not going to get involved in your own melodrama.\nYellow highlight | Page: 97\rPersistently centered consciousness is the seat of Self.\nYellow highlight | Page: 98\rby untethering yourself from the bondage of your psyche,\nYellow highlight | Page: 98\rThis freedom is so great it has been given a special name—liberation.\nYellow highlight | Page: 101\rheart. What is that feeling? Why is that happening? People don’t normally ask why; they just try to keep it from happening.\nYellow highlight | Page: 101\rYou must go deeper than that and look at the dynamics of the layers that have been created. At the core there is the pain. Then, in order to avoid the pain, you try to stay busy with friends and hide\nYellow highlight | Page: 102\rsky. You are sitting on a planet spinning around in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Though you can only see a few thousand stars, there are hundreds of billions of stars in our Milky Way Galaxy alone. In fact, it is estimated that there are over a trillion stars in the Spiral Galaxy.\nYellow highlight | Page: 102\rFrom that perspective, do you really care what people think about your clothes or your car? Do you really need to feel embarrassed if you forget someone’s name?\nYellow highlight | Page: 102\rTo spend your life avoiding pain means it’s always right behind you. At any point you could slip and say the wrong thing. At any point anything can happen. So you end up devoting your life to the avoidance of pain.\nYellow highlight | Page: 103\rIn essence, you can simply live your life and experience what it’s like to be on a planet that is spinning around in the middle of nowhere, until you die.\nYellow highlight | Page: 103\rIf you want to be free, simply view inner pain as a temporary shift in your energy flow.\nYellow highlight | Page: 103\rYou cannot spend your life avoiding things that are not actually happening, or everything will become negative.\nYellow highlight | Page: 103\rProbably more than there are stars in the sky. If you want to grow and be free to explore life, you cannot spend your life avoiding the myriad things that might hurt your heart or mind.\nYellow highlight | Page: 103\rYou must look inside yourself and determine that from now on pain is not a problem. It is just a thing in the universe.\nYellow highlight | Page: 103\rwith it, you will devote your life to avoiding it. If you feel insecurity, it’s just a feeling. You can handle a feeling. If you feel embarrassed, it’s just a feeling. It’s just a part of creation. If you feel jealousy and your heart burns, just look at it objectively, like you would a mild bruise. It’s a thing in the universe that is passing through your system. Laugh at it, have fun with it, but don’t be afraid of\nYellow highlight | Page: 103\rit. It cannot touch you unless you touch it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 104\rWise beings do not want to remain a slave to the fear of pain. They permit the world to be what it is instead of being afraid of it. They wholeheartedly participate in life, but not for the purpose of using life to avoid themselves.\nYellow highlight | Page: 104\rlet it pass through you like the wind.\nYellow highlight | Page: 105\rJust start seeing these inner experiences as energy passing through your heart and before the eye of your consciousness.\nYellow highlight | Page: 105\rrelax. Do the opposite of contracting and closing.\nYellow highlight | Page: 106\rIf you have any wisdom, you will leave it alone and not try to change your life to avoid it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 106\ryou. If you do not care, if you are no longer afraid of yourself, you are free.\nYellow highlight | Page: 106\rYou will feel everything at a deeper level. You will begin to have truly beautiful experiences rise up within you. Eventually you will understand that there is an ocean of love behind all of this fear and pain.\nYellow highlight | Page: 112\rImagine that you found yourself in the midst of an open field where the sun was always shining. It was a beautiful place of great light and great openness.\nNote:Great analogy\nYellow highlight | Page: 116\rIt’s not really difficult to get past the walls. Time and again, every day, the natural flow of life collides with our walls and tries to tear them down. But time and again, we defend them. You must realize that when you defend yourself, you are really defending your walls.\nYellow highlight | Page: 120\rSince the analytical mind cannot handle the infinite, you created an alternate reality of finite thoughts that can remain fixed within your mind.\nYellow highlight | Page: 120\rThis mental model has become your reality. You must now struggle day and night to make the world fit your model, and you label everything that doesn’t fit as wrong, bad, or unfair.\nYellow highlight | Page: 120\rYou get frustrated and angry over simple little things. This is the result of being unable to fit what’s actually happening into your model of reality.\nYellow highlight | Page: 120\rIn order to truly go beyond your model, you must first understand why you built it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 121\rIf you really want to see why you do things, then don’t do them and see what happens.\nNote:interesting\nYellow highlight | Page: 121\rThe moment somebody starts behaving in a way that is outside your expectations, your mind starts talking. It says, “What should I do about this? I can’t just ignore what he did. I could confront him directly or ask someone else to talk to him.” Your mind is telling you to fix it.\nNote:fix it in order to fit into your model\nYellow highlight | Page: 122\rThis zone is finite. All attempts to stay within it keep you finite. Going beyond always means letting go of the effort to keep things within your defined limits.\nYellow highlight | Page: 122\rIn other words, you can devote your whole life to the process of making sure everything fits within your limited model, or you can devote your life to freeing yourself from the limits of your model.\nYellow highlight | Page: 122\rBut in truth, the confines of your comfort zone create just such a cage. This inner cage doesn’t limit your body; it limits the expanse of your consciousness.\nYellow highlight | Page: 122\rIf you examine this, you will see that you’re willing to stay in this cage because you’re afraid.\nYellow highlight | Page: 122\rThey don’t say, “Get me out of here! I’m locked in this tiny world in which everything has to be a certain way. I have to worry about what everybody’s doing, what I look like, and everything I’ve ever said. I want out.”\nYellow highlight | Page: 123\rYou see that you’re afraid to tell people what you really think. You see that you’re too self-conscious to freely express yourself.\nYellow highlight | Page: 124\rSpirituality begins when you decide that you’ll never stop trying. Spirituality is the commitment to go beyond,\nYellow highlight | Page: 126\rThe day unfolds and the mind doesn’t say anything. You simply interact with the day with a peaceful, fully inspired heart.\nYellow highlight | Page: 129\ron. The more consciousness narrows its focus onto this mental structure, the greater the tendency to utilize it to define the concept of self.\nYellow highlight | Page: 130\rWho are you that is lost and trying to build a concept of yourself in order to be found?\nNote:why design a concept of self?\nYellow highlight | Page: 130\rYou will never find yourself in what you have built to define yourself. You’re the one who’s doing the building.\nYellow highlight | Page: 130\rIn this panic, in this lost state, you learned to cling and hold onto the thoughts and emotions that were passing before you. You used them to build a personality, a persona, a self-concept that would allow you to define yourself.\nYellow highlight | Page: 131\rIf you get that model down absolutely right, and behave consistently every time, you have actually “created” someone.\nYellow highlight | Page: 131\rIt got engrained in you at a very young age,\nYellow highlight | Page: 134\rthe events that happen in the moment belong to the moment. They don’t belong to you.\nYellow highlight | Page: 135\rWhen your mind is disturbed, don’t ask, “What do I do about this?” Instead ask, “Who am I that notices this?”\nYellow highlight | Page: 136\raware. If you pass through a period of darkness or depression, just ask, “Who is aware of the darkness?” That’s how you pass through the different stages of your inner growth. You just keep letting go, and remain aware that you are still there.\nYellow highlight | Page: 136\rWhen you’ve let go of the dark psyche, and you’ve let go of the light psyche, and you’re no longer clinging to anything, you will reach a point where it will all open up behind you.\nYellow highlight | Page: 136\rYou will then walk through every moment of your daily life with the flow of this inner force sustaining you,\nYellow highlight | Page: 136\rYou will still have thoughts, emotions, and a self-concept floating around in inner space, but they will be just one small part of what you experience. You will not identify with anything outside the sense of Self.\nYellow highlight | Page: 143\rEvents don’t determine whether or not you’re going to be happy. They’re just events. You determine whether or not you’re going to be happy. You can be happy just to be alive. You can be happy having all these things happen to you, and then be happy to die. If you can live this way, your heart will be so open and your Spirit will be so free, that you will soar up to the heavens.\nYellow highlight | Page: 143\rYou’re sitting on a planet spinning around in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Go ahead, take a look at reality. You’re floating in empty space in a universe that goes on forever. If you have to be here, at least be happy and enjoy the experience. You’re going to die anyway. Things are going to happen anyway. Why shouldn’t you be happy?\nYellow highlight | Page: 144\rEvery time a part of you begins to get unhappy, let it go. Work with\nYellow highlight | Page: 145\rThe technique of unconditional happiness is ideal because what you’re doing with the rest of your life is already defined—you’re letting go of yourself so that you can remain happy. As far as\nYellow highlight | Page: 146\ryour spirituality goes, you’re going to grow very rapidly.\nYellow highlight | Page: 146\rThey’re also going to notice the purification of their mind because they are not getting involved in the mind’s melodrama.\nYellow highlight | Page: 148\rEverything I look at just creates waves of joy inside me.\nYellow highlight | Page: 148\rGod in the yogic tradition is Satchitananda—Eternal, Conscious Bliss. God is ecstasy.\nYellow highlight | Page: 149\rIf you’re neither pushing life away, nor pulling it toward you, then you are not creating any resistance. You are simply present. In this state, you are just witnessing and experiencing the events of life taking place.\nYellow highlight | Page: 150\ryour being. It is what makes your arms and legs move. They don’t just move randomly by themselves. They move the way they do because you assert will to make them do so. You use the same will to hold onto thoughts when you want to concentrate on them.\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rEventually you’ll see that this resistance is a tremendous waste of energy. The fact is, you’re generally using your will to resist one of two things: that which has already happened or that which hasn’t happened yet.\nYellow highlight | Page: 151\rIt is not life’s events that are causing problems or stress. It is your resistance to life’s events that is causing this experience.\nYellow highlight | Page: 152\rThis is because we don’t all have the same preconceived notions of how things should be or how much they should matter to us.\nYellow highlight | Page: 152\rIf you want to understand stress, begin by realizing that you carry around with you your own set of preconceived notions of how things should be. It is based upon these notions that you assert your will to resist what has already happened. Where did you get these preconceived notions?\nYellow highlight | Page: 153\rbegin dealing with each situation with acceptance.\nYellow highlight | Page: 153\rThis is because events are not problems; they’re just events. Your resistance to them is what causes the problem. But, again, don’t think that because you\nYellow highlight | Page: 153\rYou will be surprised to find that in most situations there’s nothing to deal with except for your own fears and desires. Fear and desire make everything seem so complicated.\nYellow highlight | Page: 153\rWhen the events of this world make it through you, you have reached a deep spiritual state. You can then be conscious in the presence of whatever takes place, without building up blocked energies. When you attain that state, everything becomes clear. In contrast, everybody else is attempting to deal with the world around them while struggling with their own reactions and personal preferences. When a person is dealing with their own fears, anxieties, and desires, how much energy is left for dealing with what’s actually happening?\nYellow highlight | Page: 154\rStop and think about what you’re capable of achieving. Up to now, your capacities have been constrained by constant inner struggles. Imagine what would happen if your awareness was free to focus only on the events actually taking place. You would have no noise going on inside. If you lived like this, you could do anything. Your capabilities would be exponential compared to what you’ve ever experienced. If you could bring this level of awareness and clarity to everything you do, your life would change.\nYellow highlight | Page: 154\rIf you’re not trying to make people fit into your preconceived notions of what you like and dislike, you will find that relationships are not really that difficult. If you’re not so busy judging and resisting people based upon what is blocked inside of you, you will find that they are much easier to get along with—and so are you.\nYellow highlight | Page: 154\rDaily work is fun. In fact, it’s easy. Your work is just what you do with yourself during the day while you’re spinning on a planet through empty space. If\nYellow highlight | Page: 154\rOnce the personal energies pass through you, the world becomes a different place. People and events will appear different to you. You will realize that you have talents and abilities you never saw before.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rThis process of relaxing through resistance is beneficial to everything in your life. This is because it directly addresses how to keep your heart open when it is trying to close. Deep inner release is a spiritual path in and of itself.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rIt’s the work of a lifetime to become that open, that complete, and that whole.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rIf you relax and release, you will see that it puts you through tremendous spiritual growth.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rYou truly can reach a state in which you never have any more stress, tension, or problems for the rest of your life. You just have to realize that life is giving you a gift, and that gift is the flow of events that takes place between your birth and your death.\nYellow highlight | Page: 156\rLearn to stop resisting reality, and what used to look like stressful problems will begin to look like the stepping-stones of your spiritual journey.\nYellow highlight | Page: 161\rThe true seeker commits to live like that every moment and lets nothing stop them. Why should anything stop you? You’re just going to die anyway.\nYellow highlight | Page: 161\rYou have to understand that it is your attempt to get special experiences from life that makes you miss the actual experience of life. Life is not something you get; it’s something you experience. Life exists with or without you. It has been going on for billions of years. You simply\nYellow highlight | Page: 162\rYou fear death because you crave life. You fear death because you think there’s something to get that you haven’t experienced yet. Many people feel that death will take something away from them. The wise person realizes that death is constantly giving them something. Death is giving meaning to your life. You’re the one who throws your life away; you waste every second of it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 168\ris much more efficient to deal with the body in a balanced manner than to be burdened with the effects of the extremes.\nYellow highlight | Page: 170\rFor the being who is in the Tao, events take place and last just as long as they are taking place. That’s\nYellow highlight | Page: 170\rAs you let go, it comes back to center. You don’t follow the extremes, so your energy comes back to the current moment.\nYellow highlight | Page: 170\rNow let’s go sailing when there’s tremendous wind but there’s no sail. That is the opposite extreme and, again, we’re not going anywhere. Sailing is such a good example because there are many forces interacting together.

You can never see where the Tao is going; you can only be there with it.\nYellow highlight | Page: 174\rYou don’t feel resentment toward people. You don’t close or get tight as often. Things still happen that you don’t want to happen, but they don’t seem to touch you as much.\nYellow highlight | Page: 174\rAs you associate less with the physical and psychological parts of your being, you begin to identify more with the flow of pure energy.\nYellow highlight | Page: 174\rYour backdrop is openness, beauty, and appreciation.\nYellow highlight | Page: 175\rYou don’t have to make yourself feel that way; that is how Spirit feels.\nYellow highlight | Page: 175\rhow the body normally feels, you might say that it’s generally uncomfortable about one thing or another. How about the psyche? If you were being totally honest, you’d probably say that it’s generally full of complaints and fears. Well, how does Spirit normally feel? The truth is, it always feels good. It always feels high. It always feels open and light.\nYellow highlight | Page: 175\rAs you let go and willingly release the physical, emotional, and mental aspects of your being, Spirit becomes your state.\nYellow highlight | Page: 177\rWhen you walk through a beautiful botanical garden, you feel open and light.
