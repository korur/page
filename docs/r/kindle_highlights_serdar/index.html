<h1>Kindle Highlights</h1>
<p>Your Kindle Notes For:
Thinking, Fast and Slow
Daniel Kahneman
Last accessed on Friday September 20, 2019
293 Highlight(s) | 0 Note(s)
Yellow highlight | Page: 3
Many of us spontaneously anticipate how friends and colleagues will evaluate our choices; the quality and content of these anticipated judgments therefore matters.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 5
we were far too willing to believe research findings based on inadequate evidence and prone to collect too few observations in our own research.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 6
Amos was the more logical thinker, with an orientation to theory and an unfailing sense of direction.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 6
I was more intuitive and rooted in the psychology of perception, from which we borrowed many ideas.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 7
Did it occur to you that there are more than 20 male farmers for each male librarian in the United States? Because there are so many more farmers, it is almost certain that more “meek and tidy” souls will be found on tractors than at library information desks.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 7
The reliance on the heuristic caused predictable biases (systematic errors) in their predictions.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 7
We called this reliance on the ease of memory search the availability heuristic.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 8
Our article challenged both assumptions without discussing them directly. We documented systematic errors in the thinking of normal people, and we traced these errors to the design of the machinery of cognition rather than to the corruption of thought by</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 8
emotion.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 8
People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory—and this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 12
When the question is difficult and a skilled solution is not available, intuition still has a shot: an answer may come to mind quickly—but it is not an answer to the original question. The question that the executive faced (should I invest in Ford stock?) was difficult, but the answer to an easier and related question (do I like Ford cars?) came readily to his mind and determined his choice.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 12
This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 28
Our teacher took it for granted that the sympathy we would feel for the patient would not be under our control; it would arise from System 1.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 34
The Invisible Gorilla had</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 41
you would be more likely to select the tempting chocolate cake when your mind is loaded with digits.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 41
Another way of saying this is that controlling thoughts and behaviors is one of the tasks that System 2 performs.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 42
ego depletion.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 46
Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 48
children’s ability to control their attention and their ability to control their emotions.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 48
judgment? Stanovich published his conclusions in a book titled Rationality and the Reflective Mind,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 51
The word evokes memories, which evoke emotions, which in turn evoke facial expressions and other reactions, such as a general tensing up and an avoidance tendency.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 51
yielding a self-reinforcing pattern of cognitive, emotional, and physical responses that is both diverse and integrated—it has been called associatively coherent.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 51
cognition is embodied; you think with your body, not only with your brain.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 52
David Hume reduced the principles of association to three: resemblance, contiguity in time and place, and causality.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 52
effects (virus cold); things to their properties (lime green); things to the categories</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 52
exposure to a word causes immediate and measurable changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 52
We call this a priming effect</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 53
your actions and your emotions can be primed by events of which you are not even aware.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 53
influencing of an action by the idea—is known as the ideomotor effect.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 54
if you were primed to think of old age, you would tend to act old, and acting old would reinforce the thought of old age.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 54
Reciprocal links are common in the associative network.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 54
you are likely to be rewarded by actually feeling calm and kind.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 55
funding of schools was significantly greater when the polling station was in a school than when it was in a nearby location.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 55
The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accept demands from others.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 57
But your subjective experience consists largely of the story that your System 2 tells itself about what is going on. Priming phenomena arise in System 1, and you have no conscious access to them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 58
Evidently, a purely symbolic reminder of being watched prodded people into improved behavior.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 58
Timothy Wilson wrote a book with the evocative title Strangers to Ourselves. You have now been introduced to that stranger in you, which may be in control of much of what you do, although you rarely have a glimpse of it. System 1 provides the impressions that often turn into your beliefs,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 58
“His System 1 constructed a story, and his System 2 believed it. It happens to all of us.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 58
“I made myself smile and I’m actually feeling better!”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 59
The surprise is that a single dial of cognitive ease is connected to a large network of diverse inputs and outputs. Figure 5 tells the story.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 60
“Becoming Famous Overnight.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 61
greater cognitive ease in perceiving a word you have seen earlier, and it is this sense of ease that gives you the impression of familiarity.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 61
pointing one way or another. You knew soon after reading them that the first two statements are true and the last one is false. Note, however, that the statement “A chicken has three legs” is more obviously false than “A chicken has four legs.” Your associative machinery slows the judgment of the latter</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 62
But there were questions where no good answer came to mind, where all I had to go by was cognitive ease.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 62
The impression of familiarity is produced by System 1, and System 2 relies on that impression for a true/false judgment.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 62
A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 62
distinguished from truth.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 62
true. It is entirely legitimate for you to enlist cognitive ease to work in your favor,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 63
If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 63
complex language where simpler language will do.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 65
performance was better with the bad font. Cognitive strain, whatever its source, mobilizes System 2, which is more likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System 1.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 66
it. Zajonc called it the mere exposure effect.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 67
Indeed, the mere exposure effect is actually stronger for stimuli that the individual never consciously sees.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 67
The link between positive emotion and cognitive ease in System 1 has a long evolutionary history.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 67
creativity is associative memory that works</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 67
exceptionally well.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 69
Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1: when we are uncomfortable and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 69
when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 70
“I’m in a very good mood today, and my System 2 is weaker than usual. I should be extra careful.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 73
“norm theory,”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 73
“How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 74
violations of normality are detected with astonishing speed and subtlety.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 76
We are evidently ready from birth to have impressions of causality, which do not depend on reasoning about patterns of causation. They are products of System 1.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 82

An availability cascade is a self-sustaining chain of events, which may start from media reports of a relatively minor event and lead up to public panic and large-scale government action. On some occasions, a media story about a risk catches the attention of a segment of the public, which becomes aroused and worried. This emotional reaction becomes a story in itself, prompting additional coverage in the media, which in turn produces greater concern and involvement.</p>

Brain recordings also indicate that buying at especially low prices is a pleasurable event.</p>

The fundamental ideas of prospect theory are that reference points exist, and that losses loom larger than corresponding gains.</p>

The sensitivity to threats extends to the processing of statements of opinions with which we strongly disagree.</p>

Remarkably, altruistic punishment is accompanied by increased activity in the “pleasure centers” of the brain.</p>

The large impact of 0 5% illustrates the possibility effect, which causes highly unlikely</p>

The improvement from 95% to 100% is another qualitative change that has a large impact, the certainty effect.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 312
Because of the possibility effect, we tend to overweight small risks and are willing to pay far more than expected value to eliminate them</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 312
The conclusion is straightforward: the decision weights that people assign to outcomes are not identical to the probabilities of these outcomes, contrary to the expectation principle. Improbable outcomes are overweighted—this is the possibility effect. Outcomes that are almost certain are underweighted relative to actual certainty. The expectation principle, by which values are weighted by their probability, is poor psychology.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 312
there is a powerful argument that a decision maker who wishes to be rational must conform to the expectation principle.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 314
We retained utility theory as a logic of rational choice but abandoned the idea that people are perfectly rational choosers.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 314
We took on the task of developing a psychological theory that would describe the choices people make, regardless of whether they are rational.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 316
However, when an unlikely event becomes the focus of attention, we will assign it much more weight than its probability deserves.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 316
people attach values to gains and losses rather than to wealth, and the decision weights that they assign to outcomes are different from probabilities.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 318
This is where people who face very bad options take desperate gambles, accepting a high probability of making things worse in exchange for a small hope of avoiding a large loss. Risk taking of this kind often turns manageable failures into disasters.</p>

My current view of decision weights has been strongly influenced by recent research on the role of emotions and vividness in decision making.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 323
Overweighting of unlikely outcomes is rooted in System 1 features that are familiar by</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 323
Emotion and vividness influence fluency, availability, and judgments of probability—and thus account for our excessive response to the few rare events that we do not ignore.</p>

People overestimate the probabilities of unlikely events. People overweight unlikely events in their decisions.</p>

focused attention, confirmation bias, and cognitive ease.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 324
1. When you thought about the unlikely victory of a third-party candidate, your associative system worked in its usual confirmatory mode, selectively retrieving evidence, instances, and images that would make the statement true.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 324
Your judgment of probability was ultimately determined by the cognitive ease, or fluency, with which a plausible scenario came to mind.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 324
You were asked to estimate the probability of the baby going home, but you almost certainly focused on the events that might cause a baby not to be released within the normal period.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 324
Our mind has a useful capability to focus spontaneously on whatever is odd, different, or unusual.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 324
The unlikely event became focal.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 325
The probability of a rare event is most likely to be overestimated when the alternative is not fully specified.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 325
The absurdity disappeared when the same judges were asked whether the winner would be from the Eastern or the Western conference. The focal event and its alternative were equally specific in that question and the judgments of their probabilities added up to 100%.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 330
The power of format creates opportunities for manipulation, which people with an axe to grind know how to exploit.</p>

Broad framing was obviously superior in this case.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 345
All too often a company afflicted by sunk costs drives into the blizzard, throwing good money after bad rather than accepting the humiliation of closing the account of a costly failure.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 346
In the presence of sunk costs, the manager’s incentives are misaligned with the objectives of the firm and its shareholders,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 346
Boards of directors are well aware of these conflicts and often replace a CEO who is encumbered by prior decisions and reluctant to cut losses.</p>

The sunk-cost fallacy keeps people for too long in poor jobs, unhappy marriages, and unpromising research projects.</p>

Regret is one of the counterfactual emotions that are triggered by the availability of alternatives to reality.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 347
Regret and blame are both evoked by a comparison to a norm, but the relevant norms are different.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 347
Decision makers know that they are prone to regret, and the anticipation of that painful emotion plays a part in many decisions.</p>

people expect to have stronger emotional reactions (including regret) to an outcome that is produced by action than to the same outcome when it is produced by inaction.</p>

He told of listening raptly to a long symphony on a disc that was scratched near the end, producing a shocking sound, and he reported that the bad ending “ruined the whole experience.” But the experience was not actually ruined, only the memory of it.

We can infer from the speed with which people respond to questions about their life, and from the effects of current mood on their responses, that they do not engage in a careful examination when they evaluate their life. They must be using heuristics, which are examples of both substitution and WYSIATI. Although their view of their life was influenced by a question about dating or by a coin on the copying machine, the participants in these studies did not forget that there is more to life than dating or feeling lucky. The concept of happiness is not suddenly changed by finding a dime, but System 1 readily</p>

The default option is naturally perceived as the normal choice. Deviating from the normal choice is an act of commission, which requires more effortful deliberation,</p>

Its operative features, which include WYSIATI, intensity matching, and associative coherence, among others, give rise to predictable biases and to cognitive illusions such as anchoring, nonregressive predictions, overconfidence, and numerous others.</p>

“What do you do on days when it isn’t going well?” Dr. Brock was asked. He said he just stopped writing and put the work aside for a day when it would go better. I then said that the professional writer must establish a daily schedule and stick to it. I said that writing is a craft, not an art, and that the man who runs away from his craft because he lacks inspiration is fooling himself. He is also going broke.</p>

There are all kinds of writers and all kinds of methods, and any method that helps you to say what you want to say is the right method for you. Some people write by day, others by night. Some people need silence, others turn on the radio. Some write by hand, some by computer, some by talking into a tape recorder. Some people write their first draft in one long burst and then revise; others can’t write the second paragraph until they have fiddled endlessly with the first.</p>

Ultimately the product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is. I often find myself reading with interest about a topic I never thought would interest me—some scientific quest, perhaps. What holds me is the enthusiasm of the writer for his field. How was he drawn into it? What emotional baggage did he bring along? How did it change his life? It’s not necessary to want to spend a year alone at Walden Pond to become involved with a writer who did.</p>

Good writing has an aliveness that keeps the reader reading from one paragraph to the next,</p>

It’s a question of using the English language in a way that will achieve the greatest clarity and strength.</p>

Clutter is the disease of American writing. We are a society strangling in unnecessary words, circular constructions, pompous frills and meaningless jargon.</p>

The sentence is too simple—there must be something wrong with it.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 172
But the secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 173
Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that’s already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what—these</p>

Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can’t exist without the other.</p>

The reader is someone with an attention span of about 30 seconds—a person assailed by many forces competing for attention.</p>

Writers must therefore constantly ask: what am I trying to say? Surprisingly often they don’t know.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 208
have I said it? Is it clear to someone encountering the subject for the first time?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 211
Thinking clearly is a conscious act that writers must force on themselves, as if they were working on</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 212
any other project that requires logic: making a shopping list or doing an algebra problem. Good writing doesn’t come naturally, though most people seem to think it does.</p>

Readers want the person who is talking to them to sound genuine. Therefore a fundamental rule is: be yourself.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 338
Assume that you are the writer sitting down to write. You think your article must be of a certain length or it won’t seem important. You think how august it will look in print. You think of all the people who will read it. You think that it must have the solid weight of authority. You think that its style must dazzle. No wonder you tighten; you are so busy thinking of your awesome responsibility to the finished article that you can’t even start. Yet you vow to be worthy of the task, and, casting about for grand phrases that wouldn’t occur to you if you weren’t trying so hard to make an impression, you plunge in.</p>

Writing is an intimate transaction between two people, conducted on paper, and it will go well to the extent that it retains its humanity.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 352
“Who are you not to say what you think?” I tell them. “There’s only one you. Nobody else thinks or feels in exactly the same way.” “But nobody cares about my opinions,” they say. “It would make me feel conspicuous.”</p>

I don’t want to meet “one”—he’s a boring guy. I want a professor with a passion for his subject to tell me why it fascinates him.</p>

at least think “I” while you write, or write the first draft in the first person and then take the “I”s out. It will warm up your impersonal style.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 392
Sell yourself, and your subject will exert its own appeal. Believe in your own identity and your own opinions. Writing is an act of ego, and you might as well admit it. Use its energy to keep yourself going.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 418
Think of the other as a creative act: the expressing of who you are. Relax and say what you want to say. And since style is who you are, you only need to be true to yourself to find it gradually emerging from under the accumulated clutter and debris, growing more distinctive every day.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 425
Never say anything in writing that you wouldn’t comfortably say in conversation. If you’re not a person who says “indeed” or “moreover,” or who calls someone an individual (“he’s a fine individual”), please don’t write it.</p>

There is a kind of writing that might be called journalese, and it’s the death of freshness in anybody’s style. It’s the common currency of newspapers and of magazines like People—a mixture of cheap words, made-up words and clichés that have become so pervasive that a writer can hardly help using them. You must fight these phrases or you’ll sound like every hack.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 512
What is “journalese”? It’s a quilt of instant words patched together out of other parts of speech. Adjectives are used as nouns (“greats,” “notables”). Nouns are used as verbs (“to host”), or they are chopped off to form verbs (“enthuse,” “emote”), or they are padded to form verbs (“beef up,” “put teeth into”). This is a world where eminent people are “famed” and their associates are “staffers,” where the future is always “upcoming” and someone is forever “firing off” a note.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 536
Make a habit of reading what is being written today and what was written by earlier masters. Writing is learned by imitation. If anyone asked me how I learned to write, I’d say I learned by reading the men and women who were doing the kind of writing I wanted to do and trying to figure out how they did it. But cultivate the best models. Don’t assume that because an article is in a newspaper or a magazine it must be good.</p>

You’ll find ruffians and riffraff, miscreants and malefactors, reprobates and rapscallions, hooligans and hoodlums, scamps and scapegraces, scoundrels and scalawags, jezebels and jades. You’ll find adjectives to fit them all (foul and fiendish, devilish and diabolical), and adverbs and verbs to describe how the wrongdoers do their wrong, and cross-references leading to still other thickets of venality and vice. Still, there’s no better friend to have around to nudge the memory than Roget. It saves you the time of rummaging in your brain—that network of overloaded grooves—to find the word that’s right on the tip of your tongue, where it doesn’t do you any good. The Thesaurus is to the writer</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 553
what a rhyming dictionary is to the songwriter—a reminder of all the choices—and you should use it with gratitude. If, having found the scalawag and the scapegrace, you want to know how they differ, then go to the dictionary.</p>

I try to surmise how in rewriting the sentence he reassembled it to end with a phrase that will momentarily linger, or how he chose one word over another because he was after a certain emotional weight.

If you went to work for a newspaper that required you to write two or three articles every day, you would be a better writer after six months.

All writing is ultimately a question of solving a problem. It may be a problem of where to obtain the facts or how to organize the material. It may be a problem of approach or attitude, tone or style. Whatever it is, it has to be confronted and solved. Sometimes you will despair of finding the right solution—or any solution. You’ll think, “If I live to be ninety I’ll never get out of this mess.” I’ve often thought it myself. But when I finally do solve the problem it’s because I’m like a surgeon removing his 500th appendix; I’ve been there before.</p>

What annoys us is that the writer never decided what kind of article he wanted to write or how he wanted to approach us.</p>

Instead of controlling his material, his material is controlling him.</p>

Therefore ask yourself some basic questions before you start. For example: “In what capacity am I going to address the reader?” (Reporter? Provider of information? Average man or woman?) “What pronoun and tense am I going to use?” “What style?” (Impersonal reportorial? Personal but formal? Personal and casual?) “What attitude am I going to take toward the material?” (Involved? Detached? Judgmental? Ironic? Amused?) “How much do I want to cover?” “What one point do I want to make?”</p>

Every writing project must be reduced before you start to write.</p>

Therefore think small. Decide what corner of your subject you’re going to bite off, and be content to cover it well and stop.</p>

When your zest begins to ebb, the reader is the first person to know it.</p>

every successful piece of nonfiction should leave the reader with one provocative thought that he or she didn’t have before. Not two thoughts, or five—just one.</p>

what single point you want to leave in the reader’s mind. It will not only give you a better idea of what route you should follow and what destination you hope to reach; it will affect your decision about tone and attitude. Some points are best made by earnestness, some by dry understatement, some by humor.</p>

Don’t become the prisoner of a preconceived plan. Writing is no respecter of blueprints.</p>

How long should the lead be? One or two paragraphs? Four or five?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 790
Your lead may not be the best of all possible leads, but if it does the job it’s supposed to do, be thankful and proceed.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 794
Readers want to know—very soon—what’s in it for them.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 795
Therefore your lead must capture the reader immediately and force him to keep reading. It must cajole him with freshness, or novelty, or paradox, or humor, or surprise, or with an unusual idea, or an interesting fact, or a question. Anything will do, as long as it nudges his curiosity and tugs at his sleeve.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 797
Next the lead must do some real work. It must provide hard details that tell the reader why the piece was written and why he ought to read it. But don’t dwell on the reason. Coax the reader a little more; keep him inquisitive.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 800
But take special care with the last sentence of each paragraph—it’s the crucial springboard to the next paragraph.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 929
Those are some suggestions on how to get started. Now I want to tell you how to stop. Knowing when to end an article is far more important than most writers realize. You should give as much thought to choosing your last sentence as you did to your first. Well, almost as much.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 988
Use active verbs unless there is no comfortable way to get around using a passive verb.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 1,198
You’ll find that almost all of them think in paragraph units, not in sentence units. Each paragraph has its own integrity of content and structure.</p>

Be a writer. Write things down.</p>

You’ll be tempted to use all the words that are in your notes because you performed the laborious chore of getting them all down. But that’s a self-indulgence—no</p>

The second sentence has vitality, the first one is dead. Nothing is deader than to start a sentence with a “Mr. Smith said” construction—it’s where many readers stop reading. If the man said it, let him say it and get the sentence off to a warm, human start.</p>

<p>Once upon a time really smart people were completely convinced the world was flat. Then they learned that it wasn’t. But they were still pretty sure the sun revolved around the Earth … until that theory went bust, too. For an even longer period of time, smart people have believed story is just a form of entertainment. They’ve thought that beyond the immense pleasure it bestows—the ephemeral joy and deep sense of satisfaction a good story leaves us with—story itself serves no necessary purpose. Sure, our lives from time immemorial would have been far drabber without it, but we’d have survived just fine. Wrong again.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 1
Story, as it turns out, was crucial to our evolution—more so than opposable thumbs. Opposable thumbs let us hang on; story told us what to hang on</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 1
Story is what enabled us to imagine what might happen in the future, and so prepare for it—a feat no other species can lay claim to, opposable thumbs or not.1 Story is what makes us human, not just metaphorically but literally. Recent breakthroughs in neuroscience reveal that our brain is hardwired to respond to story; the pleasure we derive from a tale well told is nature’s way of seducing us into paying attention to it.2</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 2
reveal subtle universal truths that just might alter their entire perception of reality.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 3
there is an implicit framework that must underlie a story in order for that passion, that fire, to ignite the reader’s</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 3
Why do writers often have trouble embracing the notion that there is more to creating a story than having a good idea and a way with words? Because the ease with which we surrender to the stories we read tends to cloud our understanding of stories we write.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 4
Evolution dictates that the first job of any good story is to completely anesthetize the part of our brain that questions how it is creating such a compelling illusion of reality.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 4
So it’s no surprise that we tend to be utterly oblivious to the fact that beneath every captivating story, there is an intricate mesh of interconnected elements holding it together, allowing it to build with seemingly effortless precision. This often fools us into thinking we know exactly what has us hooked—things like beautiful metaphors, authentic-sounding dialogue, an interesting character—when, in fact, despite how engaging those things appear to be in and of themselves, it turns out they’re secondary. What has us hooked is something else altogether, something that underlies them, secretly bringing them to life: story, as our brain understands it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 6
It’s simple. Your brain, along with every other living organism down to the humble amoeba, has one main goal: survival.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 6
Your subconscious brain—which neuroscientists refer to as the adaptive or cognitive unconscious—is a finely tuned instrument, instantly aware of what matters, what doesn’t, why, and, hopefully, what you should do about it.2 It knows you don’t have the time to think,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 6
“Gee, what’s that loud noise? Oh, it’s a horn honking; it must be coming from that great big SUV that’s barreling straight at me. The driver was probably texting and didn’t notice me until it was too late to stop. Maybe I should get out of the—” Splat.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 8
Our brain developed a way to consciously navigate information so that, provided we have the time, we can decide on our own what to do next.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 8
Story. Here’s how neuroscientist Antonio Damasio sums it up: “The problem of how to make all this wisdom understandable, transmissible, persuasive, enforceable—in a word, of how to make it stick—was faced and a solution found. Storytelling was the solution—storytelling is something brains do, naturally and implicitly.… [I]t should be no surprise that it pervades the entire fabric of human societies and cultures.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 8
We think in story. It’s hardwired in our brain. It’s how we make strategic sense of the otherwise overwhelming world around us. Simply put, the brain constantly seeks meaning from all the input thrown at it, yanks out what’s important for our survival on a need-to-know basis, and tells us a story about it, based on what it knows of our past experience with it, how we feel about it, and how it might affect us. Rather than recording everything on a first come, first served basis, our brain casts us as “the protagonist” and then edits our experience with cinema-like precision, creating logical interrelations, mapping connections between memories, ideas, and events for future reference.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 8
Story is the language of experience,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 9
Story evolved as a way to explore our own mind and the minds of others, as a sort of dress rehearsal for the future.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 9
As a result, story helps us survive not only in the life-and-death physical sense but also in a life-well-lived social sense.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 9
Fictional narratives supply us with a mental catalogue of the fatal conundrums we might face someday and the outcomes of strategies we could deploy in them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 10
Not only do we crave story, but we have very specific hardwired expectations for every story we read,</p>
<p>Note:Story’s ability to help us safely navigate in daily life.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 10
The real answer is rather counterintuitive: our expectations have everything to do with the story’s ability to provide information on how we might safely navigate this earthly plane.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 10
When a story meets our brain’s criteria, we relax and slip into the protagonist’s skin, eager to experience what his or her struggle feels like, without having to leave the comfort of home.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 11
So what is a story? A story is how what happens affects someone who is trying to achieve what turns out to be a difficult goal, and how he or she changes as a result. Breaking it down in the soothingly familiar parlance of the writing world, this translates to</p>
<p>Note:What is a story</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 11
The “goal” is what’s known as the story question.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 11
As counterintuitive as it may sound, a story is not about the plot or even what happens in it. Stories are about how we, rather than the world around us, change. They grab us only when they allow us to experience how it would feel to navigate the plot. Thus story, as we’ll see throughout, is an internal journey, not an external one.</p>
<p>Note:***** how we change is what matters in the story</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 12
All the elements of a story are anchored in this very simple premise, and they work in unison to create what appears to the reader as reality, only sharper, clearer, and far more entertaining, because stories do what our cognitive unconscious does: filter out everything that would distract us from the situation at hand.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 12
Let’s face it, we’re all busy. Plus, most of us are plagued by that little voice in the back of our head constantly reminding us of what we really should be doing right now instead of whatever it is we’re actually doing—</p>
<p>Note:about busyness</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 12
And, as neuroscience writer Jonah Lehrer says, nothing focuses the mind like surprise.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 12
but it’s longstanding and about to reach critical mass. This means that from the first sentence we need to catch sight of the breadcrumb trail that will lure us deeper into the thicket.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 13
the sense that something is about to change (and not necessarily for the better).</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 13
As neuroscience reveals, what draws us into a story and keeps us there is the firing of our dopamine neurons, signaling that intriguing information is on its way.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 14
As readers we eagerly probe each piece of information for significance, constantly wondering, “What is this meant to tell me?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 14
We are always looking for the why beneath what’s happening on the surface. Not only because our survival might depend on it, but because it’s exhilarating. It makes us feel something—namely, curiosity. Having our curiosity piqued is visceral.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 14
the anticipation of knowledge we’re now hungry for, a sensation caused by that pleasurable rush of dopamine. Because being curious is necessary for survival (What’s that rustling in the bushes?), nature encourages it. And what better way to encourage curiosity than to make it feel good? This is why, once your curiosity is roused as a reader, you have an emotional, vested interest in finding out what happens next.</p>
<p>Note:what is necessary for surviva: list</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 15
bingo! You feel that delicious sense of urgency (hello dopamine!) that all good stories instantly ignite.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 15
What are you talking about and why should I care?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 17
We climb inside the protagonist’s skin and become sensate,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 19
“Within the brain, things are always evaluated within a specific context.”13 It is context that bestows meaning, and it is meaning that your brain is wired to sniff out.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 22
be. After all, unless something is already happening, how can we want to know what happens next?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 23
marketers, politicians, and televangelists know more about story than most writers. This is because, by definition, they start with something writers often never even think about—the point their story will make.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 23
Armed with that knowledge, they then craft a tale in which every word, every image, every nuance leads directly to it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 25
Thus your first job is to zero in on the point your story is making.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 25
A story is designed, from beginning to end, to answer a single overarching question. As readers we instinctively know this, so we expect every word, every line, every character, every image, every action to move us closer to the answer.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 26
As one editor put it, “If you can’t summarize your book in a few sentences, rewrite the book until you can.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 26
We have no idea who the protagonist is, so we have no way to gauge the relevance or meaning of anything that happens.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 26
We know who the protagonist is, but she doesn’t seem to have a goal, so we</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 26
don’t know what the point is or where the story is going.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 26
We know what the protagonist’s goal is, but have no clue what inner issue it forces him to deal with, so everything feels superficial and rather dull.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 26
We know who the protagonist is and what both her goal and her issue are, but suddenly she gets what she wants, arbitrarily changes her mind, or gets hit by a bus, and now someone else seems to be the main character.    • We’re aware of the protagonist’s goal, but what happens doesn’t seem to affect him or whether he achieves it.    • The things that happen don’t affect the protagonist in a believable way (if at all), so not only doesn’t she seem like a real person, but we have no idea why she does what she does, which makes it impossible to anticipate what she’ll do next.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 27
What was missing in all those failed manuscripts is focus. Without it, the reader has no way to gauge the meaning of anything, and since we’re wired to hunt for meaning in everything—well, you do the math.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 27
The story isn’t about whether or not the protagonist achieves her goal per se; it’s about what she has to overcome internally to do it. This is what drives the story forward. I call it the protagonist’s issue.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 27
The second element, the theme, is what your story says about human nature.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 27
Theme tends to be reflected in how your characters treat each other, so it defines what is possible and what isn’t in the world the story unfolds in.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 28
The third element is the plot itself—the events that relentlessly force the protagonist to deal with her issue as she pursues her goal, no matter how many times she tries to make an end run around her issue along the way.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 28
“minds exist to predict what will happen next.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 28
We love to figure things out and we don’t like being confused.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 28
a concrete frame of reference against which everything that happens is measured.</p>
<p>Note:how brain works</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 29
All of these contents are inextricably tied to a singular reference.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 29
What does the story tell us about what it means to be human?    • What does it say about how humans react to circumstances beyond their control?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 30
But the real secret to theme is that it’s not general; that is, the theme wouldn’t be “love” per se—rather, it would be a very specific point you’re making about love. For instance, a love story can be sweet and lyrical, revealing that people are good eggs after all; it can be hard-nosed and edgy, revealing that people are intense and quirky; it can be cynical and manipulative, revealing that people are best avoided, if possible.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 30
Knowing the theme of your story in advance helps, because it gives you a gauge by which to measure your characters’ responses to the situations they find themselves in.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 30
As corporate consultants Richard Maxwell and Robert Dickman say in their book The Elements of Persuasion, “For those of us whose business depends on being able to persuade others—which is all of us in business—the key to survival is being able to cut through all the clutter and make the sale. The good news is that the secret of selling is what it has always been—a good story.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 31
Knowing your story’s point is what helps you cut through all the clutter.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 31
the instant a reader opens your book, his cognitive unconscious is hunting for a way to make life a little easier, see things a little clearer, understand people a bit better.9 So why not take a second to ask yourself, What is it I want my readers to walk away thinking about? What point does my story make? How do I want to change the way my reader sees the world?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 33
Thus we have a bird’s-eye view of the battle between the protagonist and the plot,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 34
She was glad she had never left Henry. She’d never had a friend as loyal, as kind, as her husband. And yet, standing behind her son, waiting for the traffic light to change, she remembered how in the midst of it all there had been times when she’d felt a loneliness so deep that once, not so many years ago, having a cavity filled, the dentist’s gentle turning of her chin with his soft fingers had felt to her like a tender kindness of almost excruciating depth, and she had swallowed with a groan of longing, tears springing to her eyes.11 In that very specific memory—the dentist’s fleeting, workaday touch—an otherwise ineffable feeling of existential loneliness is made manifest, as palpable as if it had happened to us—because, as we’ll see in chapter 4, as far as our brain is concerned, it actually has. By filtering her story through the thematic lens of loss and human endurance, Strout was able to pluck an otherwise random moment from Olive’s life and use it to give us insight into how Olive sees the world, and at the same time provide a visceral glimpse of the cost of being human.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 34
Theme and Tone: It’s Not What You Say but How You Say It</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 35
Unchecked, theme is a bully, a know-it-all. And no one likes to be told what to do, which is why reverse psychology works so well.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 35
What this means is that the more passionate you are about making your point, the more you have to trust your story to convey it. As Evelyn Waugh says, “All literature implies moral standards and criticisms, the less explicit the better.”12</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 36
fiction.” But no one can deny its power as a spellbinding page-turner.</p>

What makes some people able to come through catastrophes and others, apparently just as able, strong and brave, go under?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 37
Some people survive; others don’t. What qualities are in those who fight their way through triumphantly that are lacking in those who go under?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 37
What keeps us reading is the knowledge that Scarlett’s headstrong will, her guts, her nerve—her gumption—is stronger than her need to conform to society’s dictates.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 37
Good question. Here’s the litmus test: the central theme must provide a point of view precise enough to give us specific insight into the protagonist and her internal issue, yet be broad enough to take into account everything that happens (again: the plot).</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 39
is it possible to filter the story’s other themes through it?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 39
In Gone with the Wind, Scarlett’s gumption came first, so—for better or worse—it affects everything else: her love life, her refusal to be constrained by the mores of the day, and her insatiable need to take action when she doesn’t get what she wants. Take action? Ah yes, the plot.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 39
As we know, it’s the plot that puts the protagonist through his paces, presenting increasingly difficult obstacles that must be overcome if he’s to get within grabbing distance of the brass ring.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 39
But the plot’s goal isn’t simply to find out whether he snags that brass ring or not; rather, it’s to force him to confront the internal issue that’s keeping him from it in the first place. This issue is sometimes called the protagonist’s “fatal flaw,” and whether a deep-rooted fear, a stubborn misperception, or a dubious character trait, it’s what he’s been battling throughout and what he must finally overcome to have a clear shot at the last remaining obstacle.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 39
Ironically, once he overcomes it, he often realizes true success is vastly different from what, up to that very second, he thought it was.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 40
What does Scarlett need in order to feel she’s survived what life has thrown at her?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 40
The answer is her family’s plantation, Tara. Meaning, land. As her father tells her early on, “Land is the only thing in the world that amounts to anything.…” Land is what ties you to your past and makes you who you are. Without it, you are nothing. This becomes Scarlett’s benchmark, the thing that she’s sure will prove she’s survived.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 41
Readers are a surprisingly accepting lot when it comes to willfully blind protagonists, provided they understand the reason for their blindness.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 42
Knowing what the focus of your story is allows you to do for your story what your cognitive unconscious does for you: filter out everything extraneous, everything that doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 43
Do you know what the point of your story is? What do you want people to walk away thinking about?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 43
How do you want to change how they see the world?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 43
Do you know what your story says about human nature?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 43
Stories are our way of making sense of the world, so each and every one tells us something about what it means to be human, whether the author does it on purpose or not. What is your story saying?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 44
Do the protagonist’s inner issue, the theme, and the plot work together to answer the story question?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 44
Is my theme reflected in the way the world treats my protagonist?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 44
Remember, the story question will always be in the back of your reader’s mind, and it is the responsibility of each theme-laced event to keep it there.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 44
Can you sum up what your story is about in a short paragraph?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 46
Turns out, as cognitive scientist Steven Pinker notes, “Emotions are mechanisms that set the brain’s highest-level goals.”3</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 47
I saw the world through Linda Seton’s eyes. It was visceral, and it felt like a gift—because my worldview had shifted.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 47
They had mistaken the story for what happens in it. But as we’ve learned, the real story is how what happens affects the protagonist, and what she does as a result.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 47
And guess what? Neutrality bores the reader. If it’s neutral, it’s not only beside the point, it detracts from it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 47
protagonist must react in a way the reader can see and understand in the moment. This reaction must be specific, personal, and have an effect on whether the protagonist achieves her goal.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 47
everything we experience is automatically coated in emotion. Why? It’s our version of a computer’s ones and zeros, and it’s based on a single question: Will it hurt me, or will it help me?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 47
This humble equation underlies every aspect of our rich, elegant, complex, and ever-changing sense of self, and how we experience the world around us. According to Damasio, “No set of conscious images of any kind on any topic ever fails to be accompanied by an obedient choir of emotions and consequent feelings.”5 If we’re not feeling, we’re not breathing. A neutral protagonist is an automaton.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 48
It is the protagonist’s story, after all, so we evaluate everyone and everything else based on how they affect him. Because ultimately what moves a story forward are the protagonist’s actions, reactions, and decisions, rather than the external events that trigger them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 49
This is what gives narrative story its unique power. What sets prose apart from plays, movies, and life itself is that it provides direct access to the most alluring and otherwise inaccessible realm imaginable: someone else’s mind.</p>

see into the minds of others in order to intuit their motives, thoughts, and thus, true colors.6 (We’ll explore this further in chapter 4.)</p>

If something like this happens to me, what would it feel like?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 52
To sum up, when writing in the first person, it helps to keep these things in mind:    • Every word the narrator says must in some way reflect his point of view.    • The narrator never mentions anything that doesn’t affect him in some way.    • The narrator draws a conclusion about everything he mentions.    • The narrator is never neutral; he always has an agenda.    • The narrator can never tell us what anyone else is thinking or feeling.</p>

“Every author in some way portrays himself in his works, even if it be against his will.”14 Which means it might be time to reexamine that old stalwart: “Write what you know.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 62
This tendency drives what communication scholars Chip and Dan Heath have dubbed “the Curse of Knowledge.” They explain, “Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has ‘cursed’ us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others, because we can’t readily re-create our listeners’ state of mind.”</p>

That’s why it’s always helpful to have Mark Twain’s pithy observation close at hand: “It’s no wonder that truth is stranger than fiction. Fiction has to make sense.”17</p>

Donald Windham so astutely says, “I disagree with the advice ‘write about what you know.’ Write about what you need to know, in an effort to understand.”18</p>

“agenda” often carries a negative connotation, implying something decidedly Machiavellian, as in duplicitous, manipulative, and cunning. Truth is, agenda is just another word for goal—making it completely neutral and utterly necessary to survival.</p>

In fact, Steven Pinker defines intelligent life as “using knowledge of how things work to attain goals in the face of obstacles.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 65
the most common obstacle in both life and story is figuring out what other people really mean.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 67
Mirror neurons allow us to feel what others experience almost as if it were happening to us, the better to infer what “others know in order to explain their desires and intentions with real precision.”4 But here’s the kicker. We don’t just mirror other people. We mirror fictional characters too.</p>

Pinker is quick to point out, without a goal, everything is meaningless.6</p>

None other than former president Dwight D. Eisenhower perfectly captures the essence of a successful story: “We succeed only as we identify in life, or in war, or in anything else a single overriding objective, and make all other considerations bend to that one objective.”7</p>

her internal issue—the thing she struggles with that keeps her from easily achieving</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 68
As we’ll see throughout, this internal struggle is what the reader came for, whether he’s conscious of it or not.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 69
If you don’t provide your protagonist with a driving deep-seated need that he believes his quest will fulfill, the things that happen will feel random; they won’t add up to anything.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 69
maybe? If you don’t know what the objective is, everything appears random.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 69
The action doesn’t add up, so there’s nothing to follow, which makes it impossible to anticipate what will happen next. It is anticipation that creates the intoxicating sense of momentum that hooks a reader, so stories without it remain unread.</p>

what we’ve learned from neuroscience: the brain is built to think socially. It’s not what happens externally that motivates George; it’s the responsibility he feels toward others, and how he sees himself.</p>

Proust observed, “The only true voyage of discovery … would be not to visit strange lands but to possess [new] eyes.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 73
And in so doing, he makes a discovery often made by protagonists: his external goal and his internal goal were at odds all along.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 74
In It’s a Wonderful Life, George’s internal goal is to make a big difference in the world. His external goal is to get out of Bedford Falls and build bridges, skyscrapers, and to “do big things.” He believes these goals are one and the same. The movie then chronicles how his external goal is thwarted at every turn, and instead of doing big things, he always does the right thing. In the end, that’s precisely how he achieves his internal goal—making a big difference in many people’s lives—which brings with it the realization that he actually achieved his external goal as well. He did do big things—things that are far more important and enduring than building skyscrapers. Thus, by achieving his internal goal, he was able to redefine his external goal—and, happily, discover that he’d already accomplished it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 74
But up to that moment, George fully believed that only by achieving his external goal would his internal goal be met. And as real life makes all too clear, this is rarely the case.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 75
By defining your protagonist’s internal and external goals, and then pitting them against each other, you can often ignite the kind of external tension and internal conflict capable of driving an entire narrative.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 75
internal obstacles—usually in the form of longstanding emotional and psychological barriers—that are forever holding her back. This, then, is her internal issue. We’re talking about the fear that whispers, What the hell do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 76
Adding External Problems Adds Drama Only If They’re Something the Protagonist Must Confront to Overcome Her Issue The myth that external problems add drama has plagued writers from time immemorial and has been inadvertently perpetuated by the myriad versions of the “hero’s journey” story-structure model, which mandates that certain external events must happen at certain specific points in a story.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 77
crafting protagonists whose internal progress depends on said events occurring.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Such stories are written from the outside in: the writers throw dramatic obstacles in their protagonist’s path because the timeline tells them to rather than because they’re part of an organic, escalating scenario that forces the protagonist to confront her inner issue. Thus the dramatic events aren’t spawned by the story itself but by an external by-the-numbers story-structure formula.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 77
you must make sure that everything your protagonist faces—beginning on page one—springs specifically from the problem she needs to solve, both internally and externally.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 77
using a generic “bad situation” to create the protagonist’s goal.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 77
the spotlight remained on the problem rather than the protagonist. Sure, things happened, but they didn’t affect the protagonist on anything but a surface level.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Because we had no clue what her specific desires, fears, or needs were beyond the very obvious one-dimensional need to get out of the current situation ASAP, we couldn’t anticipate how she would react to the things that happened, except in a generic, that’s-what-any-person-would-do sense. And that, my friends, is boring. Why? Because</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 77
we all have a pretty good idea of what “any person” would do. Where’s the suspense in that? We turn to story to tell us something we don’t know. So while we don’t care a whit about what “any person” would do, we care passionately about what your protagonist would do—as long as we know why.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 78
Having a firm understanding of what your protagonist’s specific goals and fears mean to her provides you with concrete plot guidelines.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 79
Our goal is to make the reader feel like they know her, and—this is essential—to care enough about her</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 79
to want to find out what will happen to her.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 82
It is this kind of glimpse into someone else’s hopes and fears that makes stories so compelling—and so much more than mere entertainment.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 82
It’s hard to understand what other people want from us. It’s hard to know what we truly want for ourselves (well, besides another piece of that salted caramel chocolate). Stories not only give us much-needed practice in figuring out what makes people tick, they give us insight into how we tick.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 83
What does achieving his goal mean to him, specifically? Do you know why? In short, what’s his motivation?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 83
Remember, achieving his goal must fulfill a longstanding need or desire—and force him to face a deep-seated fear in the process.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 83
What does achieving her external goal mean to her? How does she think it will affect how she sees herself? What does she think it will say about her? Is she right? Or is her internal goal at odds with her external goal?</p>

What deeply held belief will she have to question?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 84
WHEN I WAS FIVE, I closed my eyes and thought really hard about whether I was now invisible. After all, I couldn’t see anything, so how could anyone see me? Yes, I concluded: I had indeed vanished. It made perfect sense, and it was thrilling to boot. I felt very smart. And why not? Being wrong feels exactly like being right,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 84
Being wrong changes how we see—or don’t see—the world.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 84
And we’re wrong a lot, partly because in order to survive, we’re wired to draw conclusions about everything we see, whether or not we have all—or any—of the facts; and partly because, more often than not, it’s our cognitive unconscious that deftly constructs the implicit beliefs that then organize and rule our world.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 84
According to neuropsychologist Justin Barrett, our implicit or “nonreflective” beliefs are our default mode, constantly working behind the scenes to shape memory and experience.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 86
Everyone here is so nice—I better watch my back. And the scary thing is, we don’t even know we’re doing it until something happens that proves us wrong, and suddenly our implicit belief is catapulted into our conscious mind, where we have to either deal with it or work overtime to rationalize it away.3</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 86
T. S. Eliot so aptly noted, “The end of our exploring will be to arrive at where we started, and to know the place for the first time.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 86
The best place to start working on a story is long before your poor unsuspecting protagonist shows up on page one. The best place to start is by pinpointing the moment long before, when she first fell prey to the inner issue that’s been skewing her worldview ever since.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 87
But if you don’t know what’s broke, how can you write a story about fixing it?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 88
“No surprise in the writer, no surprise in the reader.”7 Ditto Robert B. Parker, who says he has no idea where the story is going when he starts writing.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 90
REALITY: Character Bios Should Concentrate Solely on Information Relevant to Your Story</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 90
The same goes for writing a general from-birth-to-the-present bio. The whole point of a story is to filter out the kind of unnecessary information such bios are full of.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 91
Here’s the secret: you are looking only for information that pertains to the story you’re telling. If a story is about a problem, then what you’re looking for is the root of the problem that will blossom on page one.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 91
That’s why, when writing your protagonist’s bio, the goal is to pinpoint two things: the event in his past that knocked his worldview out of alignment, triggering the internal issue that keeps him from achieving his goal; and the inception of his desire for the goal itself.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 92
Things start out one way and end up another—this is what is meant by a story’s arc.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 92
story itself unfolds in the space between the “before” and the “after.” It chronicles the exhilarating time when things are in flux, giving the reader the illusion that it really could go either way.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 92
Thus what you’re looking for when you write your character bios is the specific before that leads to the moment when suddenly everything is in flux.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 92
“before” is the yardstick that allows the reader to measure the protagonist’s progress toward “after.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 94
“Character is action”—meaning the things we do reveal who we are, especially because, as Gazzaniga reminds us, “Our actions tend to reflect our automatic intuitive thinking or beliefs.”13 Story is often about a protagonist coming to realize what’s really causing him to do the things he does, at which point he either celebrates, because he’s better than he thought, or begins making amends, because he’s worse.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 96
If you can’t picture it, it’s general. If you can see it, it’s specific.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 102
When you close your eyes, can you envision what happens, or is it still conceptual? If you can’t see it, there will be no yardstick to measure your protagonist’s progress. You can’t have an after without a before.</p>

“The entire fabric of a conscious mind is created from the same cloth—images.”4 Neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran agrees: “Humans excel at visual imagery.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 106
The point is, if I ask you to think about something, you can decide not to. But if I make you feel something? Now I have your attention. Feeling is a reaction; our</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 107
feelings let us know what matters to us, and our thoughts have no choice but to follow.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 107
Facts that don’t affect us—either directly or because we can’t imagine how the facts affect someone else—don’t matter to us. And that explains why one personalized story has infinitely more impact than an impersonal generalization, even though the scope of the generalization is a thousand times greater.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 107
Feel first. Think second. That’s the magic of story. Story takes a general situation, idea, or premise and personifies it via the very specific.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 112
not only do we think in story and in images, but as cognitive linguist George Lakoff points out, although we may not always know it, we also think in metaphor.8 Metaphor is how the mind “couches the abstract concepts in concrete terms.”9</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 112
Believe it or not, we utter about six metaphors a minute.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 113
To quote Aristotle’s perfect definition: a “metaphor consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to something else.”</p>

REALITY: Unless They Convey Necessary Information, Sensory Details Clog a Story’s Arteries</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 121
The description of a room should reveal something about the person</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 121
who lives in it or hint at the whereabouts of the missing diamond or tell us something crucial about the zeitgeist of the community in which the story unfolds—or better yet, all three.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
So if you want to write a novel that inspires people you’ve never even met to call their friends and say, “You gotta read this book,” you need to root through your story and make sure you’ve translated anything brain-numbingly vague, abstract, or generic into something that’s surprisingly specific, deliciously tangible, and grippingly visceral.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 123
Do all the “sensory details”—that is, what something tastes, feels, or looks like—have an actual story reason to be there, beyond “just because”? You want to be sure each sensory detail is strategically placed to give us insight into</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 123
your characters, your story, and perhaps even your theme. And remember, scenery without subtext is a travelogue.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 124
THE BRAIN DOESN’T LIKE CHANGE. Would you, if you’d spent millions of years evolving with the sole goal of maintaining a constant, stable equilibrium?</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 124
We don’t like change, and we don’t like conflict, either. So most of the time we do our best to avoid both. This isn’t easy, since the only real constant is change, and change is driven by conflict. This or that? Me or you? Chocolate or vanilla?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 126
And there’s the paradox: we survived because we’re risk takers, but our goal is to stay safe by not changing an iota unless we absolutely have to. Talk about conflict! And that brings us right back to story. Story’s job is to tackle exactly how we handle that conflict, which boils down to this: the battle between fear and desire.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 127
Indeed, it ripples through the story in the guise of mounting tension, engendering in the reader that delicious dopamine-driven sensation we’re addicted to when it comes to a good tale: suspense, the desire to find out what’s really going on.</p>

in fact, literally happening to us. So, although we feel Juliet’s anguish on awaking to find Romeo lifeless by her side, we never once lose sight of the fact that our own beloved is, in fact, snoring peacefully in the theater seat next to us. And that, my friends, is what makes stories so deeply satisfying. We get to try on trouble, pretty much risk-free.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 129
And so in literature, not as in life, the goal is to embrace conflict and harness it to suspense. Now, for the sixty-four-thousand-dollar question: how do you translate impending conflict into ongoing suspense?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 144
Antonio Damasio:</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 146
Kathryn Schulz of Being Wrong attests: “We think this one thing is going to happen, and something else happens instead.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 146
we’ll take a look at why “show, don’t tell” is a matter of why rather than what; and we’ll introduce the all-important “And so?” test to guarantee that neither cause-and-effect trajectory ever goes off the rails.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 146
As we know, both life and story are driven by emotion, but what they’re ordered by is logic.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 152
Since stories are about how what happens affects someone—Joe, for instance—the reason he popped the balloon is more important than the fact that he popped it. In short, the why carries more weight than the what. Think of it as a pecking order: the why comes first, because it drives the what; the why is the cause; the what is the effect.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 152
it’s about why. The internal, story-level cause-and-effect trajectory tracks the evolution of the protagonist’s inner issue, which is what motivates his actions.</p>

As Chekhov so famously said, “Don’t tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 157
What does my protagonist want to have happen during this scene? That established, ask yourself, “What is at stake here?” What will it cost her to get what she wants? Armed with this info, you’re ready to write the scene.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 157
Has the protagonist changed? He should start out feeling one way and end up feeling another—often the exact opposite of how he originally felt.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 157
Having weighed his options, given what was at stake, and then made a decision, does he now see things differently than he did when the scene opened?    • Do we know why he made the decision he did? Do we understand how he arrived at that particular conclusion, even—make that especially—if his reasoning is flawed? Can we see how this changed his assessment of what’s going on and how he’s adjusted his game plan accordingly?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 157
Notice that once again it’s the protagonist’s internal reaction to what happens that not only dictates what happens next but also gives it meaning.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 159
story is driven by the protagonist’s internal struggle,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 159
plot twists tend to stem from her attempt to get the most by giving up the least.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 159
And just like in real life, as we’ll explore in depth in the next chapter, this usually only succeeds in making the situation worse.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 159
we’re wired to predict what will happen next, and the way we do this is by charting patterns.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 160
Since a huge part of the pleasure of reading is trying to figure out what’s going to happen, readers will be spinning possible scenarios all on their own—</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 161
Each thing you add to your story is like a drop of paint falling into a bowl of clear water.</p>
<p>Note:metaphor</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 161
It spreads and colors everything. As with life, new information causes us to reevaluate the meaning and emotional weight of all that preceded it, and to see the future with fresh eyes.14</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 161
Chekhov to note to S. Shchukin, “If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 161
If it’s not going to be fired, it shouldn’t be hanging there.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 161
Gilbert says, “every action has a cause and a consequence,”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 162
This means you can gauge whether a particular scene is part of the great chain of cause and effect by asking yourself these questions:    • Does this scene impart a crucial piece of information, without which some future scene won’t make sense?    • Does it have a clear cause the reader can see (even if the “real reason” it happened will be revealed later)?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 162
• Does it provide insight into why the characters acted as they did?    • Does it raise the reader’s expectation of specific, imminent action?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 163
And that, my friends, is why, when it comes to digressions, heartless as it may seem, you have to kill them before they kill your story.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 163
Mark Twain meant when he said, “A successful book is not made of what is in it, but what is left out.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 164
A digression is any piece of information that we don’t need and therefore don’t know what to do with.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 164
the reader needs to know, at that moment</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 165
Does your story follow a cause-and-effect trajectory beginning on page one, so that each scene is triggered by the one that preceded</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 165
setting up a line of dominoes—you tap that first one, and they all fall in perfect order as each scene puts the “decision” made in the prior scene to the test.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 165
Does everything in your story’s cause-and-effect trajectory revolve around the protagonist’s quest (the story question)? If it doesn’t, get rid of it. It’s that easy.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 165
We don’t care about a hurricane, a stock market crash, or aliens taking over planet Earth unless it somehow directly affects your protagonist’s quest.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 165
When your protagonist makes a decision, is it always clear how she arrived at it, especially when she’s changing her mind about something? Don’t forget, just because you know what your protagonist is thinking doesn’t mean your readers will. Does each scene follow the action, reaction, decision pattern? It’s like the one, two, three of a waltz. Get that rhythm stuck in your head—action, reaction, decision—and then use it to build momentum.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 165
Can you answer the “And so?” to everything in the story? Ask this question relentlessly, like a four-year-old, and the minute you can’t answer, know that you’re likely in the company of a darling, a digression, or something else likely to cause your story to go into free fall.</p>

It also tends to be the thing that best spurs growth.</p>

After all, as Emily Dickinson points out, “A wounded deer leaps the highest.”8</p>

Don’t let your characters admit anything they aren’t forced to, even to themselves.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 175
Information is currency. It has to be earned.</p>

Your protagonist needs a compelling reason to admit anything.</p>

Do allow your protagonist to have secrets—but not to keep them.</p>

Do encourage your characters to lie. While in real life, we don’t want people to lie to us, in a story, characters who lie are the ones who catch our interest.</p>

Norman Krasna’s maxim “Surprise ’em with what they expect.”13</p>

To that end, there is one accessory that no antagonist should leave home without: a ticking clock. Nothing focuses the mind—not to mention the actions of the protagonist—better than a rapidly approaching deadline.</p>

It can be conceptual, like the straitjacket of strict social conformity, the dehumanization of unchecked technology, or the tyranny of the letter of the law. But—and it’s a big but—it can’t stay conceptual</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 181
This means the concept needs to be personified by specific characters who try to force the protagonist to bend to their will.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 182
What’s more, a character who’s 100 percent bad isn’t likely to change, which renders him one-note. When it comes to “what you see is what you get,” what you tend to get is bored.</p>

11. Do expose your demons. There’s another, trickier reason writers sometimes</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 183
all those things we do and think when we’re pretty sure no one else is looking. This, of course, is precisely what the reader comes for.</p>

“It must needs be that those who aim at great deeds should also suffer greatly.”15 Often in public.</p>

“One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.”</p>

Have you exposed your protagonist’s deepest secrets and most guarded flaws?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 184
that there must be a consequence to everything that happens.</p>

Does everything your protagonist does to make the situation better actually make it worse?</p>

“The brain is a born cartographer,” says neuroscientist Antonio Damasio.3 From the moment we leave the womb, it begins charting the patterns around us, always with the same agenda: What’s safe, and what had I better keep my eye on?4</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 187
Chip and Dan Heath note, “The most basic way to get someone’s attention is this: Break a pattern.”5 Can you see the fine print? In order to break a pattern, we need to know what the pattern is.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 189
“The solution, once revealed, must seem to be inevitable.”7</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 189
There’s no avoiding this truth. So keep in mind that to the reader, everything in a story is either a setup, a payoff, or the road in between.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 190
Anthony Wagner, when trying to focus on multiple sources of information coming from the external world or emerging out of memory, people are “not able to filter out what’s not relevant to their current goal.”8 Thus, while the reader’s mind mulls over the import of Betty’s boyfriend, the significance</p>

We know anticipation feels really good, and that what readers love to hunt for is the emerging path from setups to payoffs.</p>

After all, a big part of the pleasure of reading is recognizing, interpreting, and then connecting the dots so the pattern emerges. To make that possible, there are three basic rules it behooves writers to know.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 199
Is there a clear series of events—a pattern—that begins with the setup and culminates in the payoff?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 200
Memory mines the information your brain has acquired in the past for anything that might help it solve the problem you’re facing in the present.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 200
storing information is adaptive: it supports future decisions and judgments that cannot be known with certainty in advance.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 200
In his book Self Comes to Mind, neuroscientist Antonio Damasio speculates</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 200
“the ability to navigate the future in the seas of our imagination, guiding the self craft into a safe and productive harbor.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 200
We use the past as a yardstick against which we size up the present in order to make it to tomorrow.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 200
Memories are continually revised, along with the meaning we derive from them, so that in the future they’ll be of even more use.</p>

memories aren’t just for reminiscing. They never were. Memories are for navigating the now.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 203
That is to say, the crow flies in spirals. Because it’s not just about getting from point A to point Z; it’s about being aware of everything—past, present, and future, internal and external—that affects the protagonist’s struggle, each step of the way.</p>

When I had been writing food reviews for a number of years, there were so many restaurants and individual dishes in my brainpan that when people asked for a recommendation, I</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 319
couldn’t think of a single restaurant where I’d ever actually eaten. But if the person could narrow it down to, say, Indian, I might remember one lavish Indian palace, where my date had asked the waiter for the Rudyard Kipling sampler and later for the holy-cow</p>
<p>Note:General to specific</p>

Then, with your fingers poised on the keyboard, you squint at an image that is forming in your mind—a scene, a locale, a character, whatever—and you try to quiet your mind so you can hear what that landscape or character has to say above the other voices</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 347
in your mind. The other voices are banshees and drunken monkeys. They are the voices of anxiety, judgment, doom, guilt. Also, severe hypochondria. There may be a Nurse Ratched–like listing of things that must be done right this moment: foods that must come out of the freezer, appointments that must be canceled or made, hairs that must be tweezed.</p>

But it is fantasy to think that successful writers do not have these bored, defeated hours, these hours of deep insecurity when one feels as small and jumpy as a water bug.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 452
They do. But they also often feel a great sense of amazement that they get to write, and they know that this is what they want to do for the rest of their lives.</p>

Perfectionism means that you try desperately not to leave so much mess to clean up. But clutter and mess show us that life is being lived. Clutter is wonderfully fertile ground—you can still discover new treasures under all those piles, clean things up, edit things out, fix things, get a grip. Tidiness suggests that something is as good as it’s going</p>

think that something similar happens with our psychic muscles. They cramp around our wounds—the pain from our childhood, the losses and disappointments of adulthood, the</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 606
humiliations suffered in both—to keep us from getting hurt in the same place again, to keep foreign substances out. So those wounds never have a chance to heal.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 607
Perfectionism is one way our muscles cramp. In some cases we don’t even know that the wounds and the cramping are there, but both limit us. They keep us</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 608
moving and writing in tight, worried ways.</p>
<p>Note:Our traumas</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 619
that awareness is learning to keep yourself company.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 622
In any case, the bottom line is that if you want to write, you get to, but you probably won’t be able to get very far if you don’t start trying to get over your perfectionism.</p>

Still, even on those days, you might notice how great perseverance feels.</p>

Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones

ON THE FINAL day of my sophomore year of high school, I was hit in the face with a baseball bat. As my classmate took a full swing, the bat slipped out of his hands and came flying toward me before striking me directly between the eyes. I have no memory of the moment of impact.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 134
I built good sleep habits and went to bed early each night. In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to keep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confident again.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 137
A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in many cases, automatically. As each semester passed, I accumulated small but consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to me when I started.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 150
changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 151
depends on the quality of our habits.1 With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 160
I began by publishing a new article every Monday and Thursday. Within a few months, this simple writing habit led to my first one thousand email subscribers, and by the end of 2013 that number had grown to more than thirty thousand people.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 165
In 2015, I reached two hundred thousand email subscribers and signed a book deal with Penguin Random House to begin writing the book you are reading now. As my audience grew, so did my business opportunities. I was increasingly asked to speak at top companies about the science of habit formation, behavior</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 167
change, and continuous improvement. I found myself delivering keynote speeches at conferences in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 178
The entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, “To write a great book, you must first become the book.”</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 186
The fields I draw on—biology, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, and more—have been around for many years. What I offer you is a synthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out a long time ago as well as the most compelling discoveries scientists have made recently.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 188
My contribution, I hope, is to find the ideas that matter most and connect them in a way that is highly actionable. Anything wise in these pages you should credit to the many experts who preceded me. Anything foolish, assume it is my error.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 195
Behavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you offered the right reward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain way. But while Skinner’s model did an excellent job of explaining how external stimuli influenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior. Internal states—our moods and emotions—matter, too. In recent decades, scientists have begun to determine the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behavior. This research will also be covered in these pages.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 246
WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 247
It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 248
Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 248
requires massive action.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 249
Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 250
Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done.12 Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 259
Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.13</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 260
The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 277
Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 279
Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 284
Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 285
your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 287
If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 288
Are you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self.</p>

Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.</p>

The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change. Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This pattern</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 381
progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 383
Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 395
Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 397
When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 400
The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 404
Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 407
A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 414
The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 420
You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 442
Few things can have a more powerful impact on your life than improving your daily habits.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 448
Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 459
The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 461
Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 464
Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 470
Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says,</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 470
“No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs. The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who smokes.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 474
Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).” They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 483
Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 486
hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed who you are.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 497
The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 499
The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 502
Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 505
Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 506
The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. ■ The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. ■ The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.</p>

<p>Blue highlight | Location: 528
When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 537
Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 542
Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.fn2 More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 546
The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 557
Each experience in life modifies your self-image, but it’s unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 561
In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 561
This is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit.6 We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 566
Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 568
Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements. Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 576
Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 577
When the votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 583
It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 591
For example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?” It’s probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus shifts from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is consistent and reliable (identity-based).</p>

Once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity.</p>

<p>Blue highlight | Location: 606
Identity change is the North Star of habit change.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 608
“Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?” The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder. And that’s why we are starting here.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 610
You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You can</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 611
choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. And this brings us to the deeper purpose of this book and the real reason habits matter.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 619
■ There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 621
The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 622
Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 624
Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 625
The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 649
A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 650
The process of habit formation begins with trial and error. Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you come across a problem, you’re not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndike’s cat, you’re just trying things out to see what works.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 663
As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 670
Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution. The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.7</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 677
Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 682
Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 697
First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 703
Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides. You are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth. You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be entertained. Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 709
For someone who rarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are just background noise. Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 716
habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 721
Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones.11 Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 745
All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you face.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 785
The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. ■ Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 788
The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 813
The human brain is a prediction machine.5 It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 814
across. Whenever you experience something repeatedly—like a paramedic seeing the face of a heart attack patient or a military analyst seeing a missile on a radar screen—your brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use.</p>

Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent.10 The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is “point-only,” and “within two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.”11</p>

My wife does something similar. Whenever we are preparing to walk out the door for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essential items in her packing list. “I’ve got my keys. I’ve got my wallet. I’ve got my glasses. I’ve got my husband.”</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 911
The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 925
The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 980
Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why. As the writer Jason Zweig noted, “Obviously you’re never going to just work out without conscious thought.9 But like a dog salivating at a bell, maybe you start to get antsy around the time of day you normally</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 984
work out.”</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 1,009
When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,032

People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are.2 If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of cookies on the counter, I’ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn’t been thinking about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily feel hungry.</p>

In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E).3 It didn’t take long</p>

We like to think that we are in control. If we choose water over soda, we assume it is because we wanted to do so. The truth, however, is that many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.</p>

The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision. The human body has about eleven million sensory receptors.7 Approximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that half of the brain’s resources are used on vision.</p>

As a result, you can imagine how important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.</p>

the homes with the meters located in the main hallway used less electricity. When their energy use was obvious and easy to track, people changed their behavior.9</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,185
The same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you’ll think about your habit throughout the day.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,188
Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people live in a world others have created for them.</p>

The cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. For example, many people drink more in social situations than they would ever drink</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,195
alone. The trigger is rarely a single cue, but rather the whole situation: watching your friends order drinks, hearing the music at the bar, seeing the beers on tap.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,196
We mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur: the home, the office, the gym. Each location develops a connection to certain habits and routines. You establish a particular relationship with the objects on your desk, the items on your kitchen counter, the things in your bedroom.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 1,198
Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 1,199
Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 1,208
The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be easier to change in a new environment.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 1,209
It helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a new place—a different coffee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you seldom use—and create a new routine there.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 1,211
It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 1,213
But when you step outside your normal environment, you leave your behavioral biases behind.13 You aren’t battling old environmental cues, which allows new habits to form without interruption.14</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 1,216
Want to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a rooftop patio, or a building with expansive architecture. Take a break from the space where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your current thought patterns.</p>

Trying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on autopilot at your regular supermarket. Try a new grocery store. You may find it easier to avoid unhealthy food when your brain doesn’t automatically know where it is located in the store.</p>

The mantra I find useful is “One space, one use.”</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 1,228
Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—and the easier ones will usually win out.</p>

enough. If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for reading,</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 1,236
his phone only for social media and texting. Every habit should have a home.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 1,237
If you can manage to stick with this strategy, each context will become associated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Habits thrive under predictable circumstances like these.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 1,239
If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 1,240
A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form.</p>

Robins found that when soldiers who had been heroin users returned home, only 5 percent of them became re-addicted within a year, and just 12 percent relapsed within three years.

overweight, a smoker, or an addict, you’ve been told your entire life that it is because you lack self-control—maybe even that you’re a bad person. The idea that a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is deeply embedded in our culture.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,274
Recent research, however, shows something different. When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,278
The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often.6 So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,371
Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality—</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,372
like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than usual.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,373
Humans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions of reality. Junk food, for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. After spending hundreds of thousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the wild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value on salt, sugar, and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and they were quite rare when our ancient ancestors were roaming the savannah. When you don’t know where your next meal is coming from, eating as much as possible is an excellent strategy for survival.</p>

Today, however, we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food is abundant, but your brain continues to crave it like it is scarce. Placing a high value on salt, sugar, and fat is no longer advantageous to our health, but the craving persists because the brain’s reward centers have not changed for approximately fifty thousand years. The modern food industry relies on stretching our Paleolithic instincts beyond their evolutionary purpose.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 1,384
Entire departments are dedicated to optimizing how a product feels in your mouth—a quality known as orosensation. French fries, for example, are a potent combination—golden brown and crunchy on the outside, light and smooth on the inside.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 1,389
But foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep the experience novel and interesting, encouraging you to eat more.</p>

Stephan Guyenet, a neuroscientist who specializes in eating behavior and obesity, says, “We’ve gotten too good at pushing our own buttons.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,395
The modern food industry, and the overeating habits it has spawned, is just one example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: Make it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,397
Look around. Society is filled with highly engineered versions of reality that are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in. Stores feature mannequins with exaggerated hips and breasts to sell clothes. Social media delivers more “likes” and praise in a few minutes than we could ever get in the office or at home.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 1,400
Advertisements are created with a combination of ideal lighting, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits—even the model doesn’t look like the person in the final image. These are the supernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate features that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result, driving us into excessive shopping habits, social media habits, porn habits, eating habits, and many others.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,406
Compared to nature, these pleasure-packed experiences are hard to resist. We have the brains of our ancestors but temptations they never had to face.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,408
While it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by understanding what a craving is and how it works. We begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share—the dopamine spike.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,412
Scientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring a neurotransmitter called dopamine.fn1</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,421
Even though dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn’t want it anymore. The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped.11</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,424
In one study, mice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time they poked their nose in a box. Within minutes, the mice developed a craving so</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,425
strong they began poking their nose into the box eight hundred times per hour.12 (Humans are not so different: the average slot machine player will spin the wheel six hundred times per hour.13)</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,428
Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop.14 Every behavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,431
For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary movement.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,433
dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,436
Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,438
It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 1,439
Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward.18 This is one reason the anticipation of an experience can often feel better than the attainment of it. As a child, thinking about Christmas morning can be better than opening the gifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more enjoyable than actually being on vacation. Scientists refer to this as the difference between “wanting” and “liking.”</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 1,459
Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 1,459
The wanting centers in the brain are large: the brain stem, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal striatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal cortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are much smaller. They are often referred to as “hedonic hot spots” and are distributed like tiny islands throughout the brain. For instance, researchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens is activated during wanting.19 Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is activated during liking.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,464
The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,465
of the crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response. These insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change. We need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the first place. This is where a strategy known as temptation bundling comes into play.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,493
Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.”23 In other words, even if you don’t really want to process overdue work emails, you’ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do something you really want to do along the way.</p>

We began this chapter by discussing supernormal stimuli, which are heightened versions of reality that increase our desire to take action. Temptation bundling is one way to create a heightened version of any habit by connecting it with something you already want.</p>

The Polgar sisters grew up in a culture that prioritized chess above all else—praised them for it, rewarded them for it. In their world, an obsession with chess was normal. And as we are about to see, whatever habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll find.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,552
As Charles Darwin noted, “In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.” As a result, one of the deepest human desires is to belong. And this ancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern behavior.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,564
We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:2 The close. The many. The powerful.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,570
We pick up habits from the people around us. We copy the way our parents handle arguments, the way our peers flirt with one another, the way our coworkers get results. When your friends smoke pot, you give it a try, too. When your wife has a habit of double-checking that the door is locked before going to bed, you pick it up as well.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,585
One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. New habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every day. If you are surrounded by fit people, you’re more likely to consider working out to be a common habit. If you’re surrounded by jazz lovers, you’re more likely to believe it’s reasonable to play jazz every day. Your culture sets your expectation for what is “normal.” Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise together.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,590
To make your habits even more attractive, you can take this strategy one step further. Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. Steve Kamb, an entrepreneur in New York City, runs a company called Nerd Fitness, which “helps nerds, misfits, and mutants lose weight,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,593
get strong, and get healthy.” His clients include video game lovers, movie fanatics, and average Joes who want to get in shape.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,594
but if you are already similar to the other members of the group in some way—say, your mutual love of Star Wars—change becomes more appealing because it feels like something people like you already do.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,596
Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It transforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on your own. Your identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,599
We are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,626
Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, “What is everyone else doing?” We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying, eating, and travel habits. It’s usually a smart strategy. There is evidence in numbers.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,629
But there can be a downside. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. For example, one study found that when a chimpanzee learns an effective way to crack nuts open as a member of one group and then switches to a new group that uses a less effective strategy, it will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to blend in with the rest of the chimps.</p>

The reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,635
The human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants to get along with others. This is our natural mode. You can override it—you can choose to ignore the group or to stop caring what other people think—but it takes work. Running against the grain of your culture requires extra effort.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,637
When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.</p>

Historically, a person with greater power and status has access to more resources, worries less about survival, and proves to be a more attractive mate.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 1,643
We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration, and status. We want to be the one in the gym who can do muscle-ups or the musician who can play the hardest chord progressions or the parent with the most accomplished children because these things separate us from the crowd. Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,645
This is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly effective people. We try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,649
High-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of others. And that means if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,650
We are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our status. We trim our hedges and mow our lawn because we don’t want to be the slob of the neighborhood. When our mother comes to visit, we clean up the house because we don’t want to be judged. We are continually wondering “What will others think of me?” and altering our behavior based on the answer.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,659
The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. ■ We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. ■ We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). ■ One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have</p>

Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of old vices. The underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same. The specific habits we perform differ based on the period of history.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,721
Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it. Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. As we covered</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,723
in our discussion of the 1st Law, your brain is continually absorbing information and noticing cues in the environment. Every time you perceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction about what to do in the next moment.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,734
Two people can look at the same cigarette, and one feels the urge to smoke while the other is repulsed by the smell. The same cue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on your prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,736
These predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically describe a craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can apply.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,741
A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state. When the temperature falls, there is a gap between what your body is currently sensing and what it wants to be sensing. This gap between your current state and your desired state provides a reason to act.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,744
Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,747
Our feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current state or to make</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,747
a change. They help us decide the best course of action.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,749
As the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, “It is emotion that allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,753
In time, you learn to predict that checking social media will help you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow you to forget your fears. Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,756
You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. For instance, we often talk about everything we have to do in a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner for your family. Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.4 You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,763
The key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.</p>

Pregame jitters. Many people feel anxious before delivering a big presentation or competing in an important event. They experience quicker breathing, a faster heart rate, heightened arousal. If we interpret these feelings negatively, then we feel threatened and tense up. If we interpret these feelings positively, then we can respond with fluidity and grace. You can reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.”7</p>

with a particular habit or situation. If you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation ritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,786
Ed Latimore, a boxer and writer from Pittsburgh, benefited from a similar strategy without knowing it.8 “Odd realization,” he wrote. “My focus and concentration goes up just by putting my headphones [on] while writing. I don’t even have to play any music.” Without realizing it, he was conditioning himself. In the beginning, he put his headphones on, played some music he enjoyed, and did focused work. After doing it five, ten, twenty times, putting his headphones on became a cue that he automatically associated with increased focus. The craving followed naturally.</p>

ON THE FIRST day of class, Jerry Uelsmann, a professor at the University of Florida, divided his film photography students into two groups. Everyone on the left side of the classroom, he explained, would be in the “quantity” group. They would be graded solely on the amount of work they produced. On the final day of class, he would tally the number of photos submitted by each student. One hundred photos would rate an A, ninety photos a B, eighty photos a C, and so on.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 1,846
Meanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the “quality” group. They would be graded only on the excellence of their work. They would only need to produce one photo during the semester, but to get an A, it had to be a nearly perfect image. At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best photos were produced by the quantity group. During the semester, these students were busy taking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting, testing out various methods in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. In the process of creating hundreds of photos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile, the quality group sat around speculating about perfection. In the end, they had little to show for their efforts other than unverified theories and one mediocre photo.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,856
I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,858
Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that’s motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that’s action. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that’s motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that’s action.</p>

It’s easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you’re still making progress. You think, “I’ve got conversations going with four potential clients right now. This is good.

Strategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce the identity you want to build. If you show up at the gym five days in a row—even if it’s just for two minutes—you are casting votes for your new identity. You’re not worried about getting in shape. You’re focused on becoming the type of person who doesn’t miss</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,167

Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward. ■ Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one. ■ The Two-Minute Rule states,</p>

Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard. This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it difficult. If you find yourself continually struggling to follow through on your plans, then you can take a page from Victor Hugo and make</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,201
your bad habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a commitment device. A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future.2 It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones. When Victor Hugo shut his clothes away so he could focus on writing, he was creating a commitment device.4 fn2</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,212
Commitment devices are useful because they enable you to take advantage of good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation. Whenever I’m looking to cut calories, for example, I will ask the</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,214
waiter to split my meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served. If I waited until the meal came out and told myself “I’ll just eat half,” it would never work.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,215
The key is to change the task such that it requires more work to get out of the good habit than to get started on</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,218
effort and may cost money. Commitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing in the future by making bad habits difficult in the present. However, we can do even better. We can make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,236
The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act. The brilliance of the cash register was that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing practically impossible. Rather than trying to change the employees, it made the preferred behavior automatic.</p>

Technology creates a level of convenience that enables you to act on your smallest whims and desires. At the mere suggestion of hunger, you can have food delivered to your door. At the slightest hint of boredom, you can get lost in the vast expanse of social media.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,278
When the effort required to act on your desires becomes effectively zero, you can find yourself slipping into whatever impulse arises at the moment. The downside of automation is that we can find ourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but ultimately more rewarding, work.</p>

It was a powerful example of the fourth and final Law of Behavior Change: make it satisfying.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,375
We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,383
Tasty flavors and the feeling of a fresh mouth provided little bits of immediate reinforcement and made the product satisfying to use. Consumption skyrocketed, and Wrigley became the largest chewing gum company in the world.9</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,393
Stories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. You learn what to do in the future based on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished for doing) in the past. Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 2,395
The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the habit loop. But there is a trick. We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 2,402
You are constantly focused on the present or the very near future. You live in what scientists call an immediate-return environment</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,406
You live in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 2,407
The human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment. The earliest remains of modern humans,</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,408
known as Homo sapiens sapiens, are approximately two hundred thousand years old.12 These were the first humans to have a brain relatively similar to ours. In particular, the neocortex—the newest part of the brain and the region responsible for higher functions like language—was roughly the same size two hundred thousand years ago as today. You are walking around with the same hardware as your Paleolithic ancestors.13</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,413
the last five hundred years or so—that society has shifted to a predominantly delayed-return environment.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,416
The world has changed much in recent years, but human nature has changed little.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,420
And after thousands of generations in an immediate-return environment, our brains evolved to prefer quick payoffs to long-term ones.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,421
Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency. That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time.fn2 You value the present more than the future.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,425
Why would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lung cancer? Why would someone overeat when they know it increases their</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,426
risk of obesity? Why would someone have unsafe sex if they know it can result in sexually transmitted disease?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,427
Once you understand how the brain prioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: the consequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are immediate.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,431
Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately, these outcomes are often misaligned.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,434
“It almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa ….18 Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.”</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,440
However, when the moment of decision arrives, instant gratification usually wins.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,446
Our preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth about success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,450
People who are better at delaying gratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, and superior social skills.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,456
Thankfully, it’s possible to train yourself to delay gratification—but you need to work with the grain of human nature, not</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,457
against it. The best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,459
The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful—even if it’s in a small way. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid off and that the work was worth the effort.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,466
What we’re really talking about here—when we’re discussing immediate rewards—is the ending of a behavior. The ending of any experience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,468
The best approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,469
Habit stacking, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start. Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,477
The immediate reward of seeing yourself save money toward the leather</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,478
jacket feels a lot better than being deprived. You are making it satisfying to do nothing.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,487
Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,492
In summary, a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. Simple bits of reinforcement—like soap that smells great or toothpaste that has a refreshing mint flavor or seeing $50 hit your savings account—can offer the immediate pleasure you need to enjoy a habit. And change is easy when it is enjoyable.</p>

Visual measurement comes in many forms: food journals, workout logs, loyalty punch cards, the progress bar on a software download, even the page numbers in a book. But perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with a habit tracker.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,525
Countless people have tracked their habits, but perhaps the most famous was Benjamin Franklin.2 Beginning at age twenty, Franklin carried</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,527

“Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. Don’t break the chain of sales calls and you’ll build a successful book of business. Don’t break the chain of workouts and you’ll get fit faster than you’d expect. Don’t break the chain of creating every day and you will end up</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,535
Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,558
Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused on the process rather than the result. You’re not fixated on getting six-pack abs, you’re just trying to keep the streak alive and become the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,560
In summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,562
whenever you record another successful instance of your habit.</p>

Indeed, beneath the surface of every behavior. Genes have been shown to influence everything from the number of hours you spend watching television to your likelihood to marry or divorce to your tendency to get addicted to drugs, alcohol, or nicotine.8 There’s a strong genetic component to how obedient or rebellious you are when facing authority, how vulnerable or resistant you are to stressful events, how proactive or reactive you tend to be, and even how captivated or bored you feel during sensory experiences like attending a concert.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,835
Robert Plomin,</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,835
King’s College in London, told me, “It is now at the point where we have stopped testing to see if traits have a genetic component because we literally can’t find a single one that isn’t influenced by our genes.”10</p>

The most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,840
Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other. Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts). Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,850
natural antidepressant.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,852
As a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a personality trait all people possess to various degrees. People who are high in neuroticism tend to be anxious and worry more than others. This trait has been</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,853
linked to hypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain responsible for noticing threats.14 In other words, people who are more sensitive to negative cues in their environment are more likely to score high in neuroticism.</p>

Learning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful. In theory, you can enjoy almost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the things that come easily to you. People who are talented in a particular area tend to be more competent at that task and are then praised for doing a good job. They stay energized because they are making progress where others have failed, and because they get rewarded with better pay and bigger opportunities, which not only makes them happier but also propels them to produce even higher-quality work. It’s a virtuous cycle.</p>

Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.</p>

The most common approach is trial and error. Of course, there’s a problem with this strategy: life is short. You don’t have time to try every career, date every eligible bachelor, or play every musical instrument.

activity, there should be a period of exploration. In relationships, it’s called dating. In college, it’s called the liberal arts. In business, it’s called split testing. The goal is to try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.</p>

In the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent. Google famously asks employees to spend 80 percent of the workweek on their official job and 20 percent on projects of their choice, which has led to the creation of</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,892
blockbuster products like AdWords and Gmail.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,897
As you explore different options, there are a series of questions you can ask yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you:</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,899
What feels like fun to me, but work to others? The mark of whether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most people.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,900
When are you enjoying yourself while other</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 2,900
people are complaining? The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,901
What makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades away.19 This blend of happiness and peak performance is what athletes and performers experience when they are “in the zone.” It is nearly impossible to experience a flow state and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,905
Where do I get greater returns than the average person? We are continually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a behavior is more likely to be satisfying when the comparison is in our favor. When I started writing at jamesclear.com, my email list grew very quickly. I wasn’t quite sure what I was doing well, but I knew that results seemed to be coming faster for me than</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,908
for some of my colleagues, which motivated me to keep writing.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,909
What comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, “What feels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?” No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,913
To be honest, some of this process is just luck. Michael Phelps and Hicham El Guerrouj were lucky to be born with a rare set of abilities that are highly valued by society and to be placed in the ideal environment for those abilities.</p>

If you can’t find a game where the odds are stacked in your favor, create one. Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, says, “Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort.20 In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.”</p>

When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids</p>

The fact that you have a natural limit to any specific ability has nothing to do with whether you are reaching the ceiling of your capabilities. People get so caught up in the fact that they have limits that they rarely exert the effort required to get close to them.</p>

Furthermore, genes can’t make you successful if you’re not doing the work. Yes, it’s possible that the ripped trainer at the gym has better genes, but if you haven’t put in the same reps, it’s impossible to say if you have been dealt a better or worse genetic hand. Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck. In summary, one of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills. Work hard on the things that come easy.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,948
The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. ■ Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle. ■ Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. ■ Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you. ■ Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t find a game that favors you, create one. ■ Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.</p>

While there is still much to learn, one of the most consistent findings is that the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “just manageable difficulty.”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 2,982
The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty. If you love tennis and try to play a serious match against a four-year-old, you will quickly become bored. It’s too easy. You’ll win every point. In contrast, if you play a professional tennis player like Roger Federer or Serena Williams, you will quickly lose motivation because the match is too difficult.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,988
The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,993
When you’re starting a new habit, it’s important to keep the behavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it even when conditions aren’t perfect. This is an idea we covered in detail while discussing the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 3,003
A flow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and fully immersed in an activity. Scientists have tried to quantify this feeling. They found that to achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current ability.5 In real life it’s typically not feasible to quantify the difficulty of an action in this way, but the core idea of the Goldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just manageable difficulty—something on the perimeter of your ability—seems crucial for maintaining motivation.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 3,007
Improvement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularly search for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make enough progress to stay motivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without variety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self-improvement.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 3,015
He mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he said something I wasn’t expecting: “At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 3,017
His answer surprised me because it’s a different way of thinking about work ethic. People talk about getting “amped up” to work on their goals. Whether it’s business or sports or art, you hear people say things like, “It all comes down to passion.” Or, “You have to really want it.” As a result, many of us get depressed when we lose focus or motivation because we think that successful people have some bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was saying that</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 3,020
really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 3,025
The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 3,029
As Machiavelli noted, “Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 3,033
In psychology, this is known as a variable reward.7 fn2 Slot machines are the most common real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpot every now and then but not at any predictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. This variance leads to the greatest</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 3,036
spike of dopamine, enhances memory recall, and accelerates habit formation.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 3,037
Variable rewards won’t create a craving—that is, you can’t take a reward people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval, and hope it will change their mind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings we already experience because they reduce boredom.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 3,043
Of course, not all habits have a variable reward component, and you wouldn’t want them to. If Google only delivered a useful search result some of the time, I would switch to a competitor pretty quickly. If Uber only picked up half of my trips, I doubt I’d be using that service much longer.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 3,050
I can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking to it, there will be days when you feel like quitting. When you start a business, there will be days when you don’t feel like showing up. When you’re at the gym, there will be sets that you don’t feel like finishing. When it’s time to write, there will be days that you don’t feel like typing. But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or draining to do so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 3,054
Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.</p>

David Cain, an author and meditation teacher, encourages his students to avoid being “fair-weather meditators.” Similarly, you don’t want to be a fair-weather athlete or a fair-weather writer or a fair-weather anything.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 3,057
When a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 3,058
Professionals take action even when the mood isn’t right.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 3,060
There have been a lot of articles I haven’t felt like writing, but I’ve never regretted publishing on schedule. There have been a lot of days I’ve felt like relaxing, but I’ve never regretted showing up and working on something that was important to me. The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 3,065
The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. ■ The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. ■ As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored. ■ Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference.</p>

I will hazard a prediction. When you are 80 years old and in a quiet moment of reflection, narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your life’s story, the telling that will be most compact and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made. In the end, we are our choices. —Jeff Bezos, 2010 Princeton Commencement</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 71
Now look ahead. Before long, all public and private communication—entertainment, news, music, sports, social media, online searches—will be ad-free, leaving sides of buses as the publicity medium of last resort.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 73
Millennials, that vital under-forty market, are not only banishing advertising from their lives but sneering at the institution itself, denouncing its bragging and promising as deceitful, manipulative, the next thing to micro-aggression.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 79
In 2015, 76 percent of marketers surveyed by Adobe claimed that marketing had changed more in the last two years than it had in all the decades since the birth of television.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 80
Many chief marketing officers swear they will never again trust advertising to deliver customers. Some CMOs condemn ad agencies for wasting time and money trying to be Super Bowl–creative instead of market-effective. Others blame the noise from free online ads that drowns out their paid ads. Still others complain that falling return on investment (ROI) and rising costs make advertising just too damn expensive. Of course, if advertising suddenly redelivered the mass consumers of decades past, all would be forgiven.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 84
The more the push strategies of bragging and promising lose traction, the more marketers turn to the pull tactics of effective storytelling.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 85
To support their efforts, the Harvard Business Review has published dozens of articles on the persuasive power of story for both leadership and branding, a myriad of TED talks have championed the neuroscience behind storified messaging, and how-to writers have poured out dozens upon dozens of story-in-business manuals that could fill a wall at Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 90
but overall, corporate storytelling continues to sputter and stumble in confusion, more a trend than a tool.</p>

results. The difference between data and story is this: Data lists what happened; story expresses how and why it happened. Data compiles facts by quantity and frequency; story reveals the causalities behind and beneath those facts. Story eliminates irrelevancies, concentrates on dynamic change, and then reshapes factual subject matter into a structure that links events into chains of cause and effect, played out over time.</p>

Pennsylvania Gazette filled with ads, the</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 159
recognized brands quickly followed suit.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 269
If they created ads that</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 269
connected emotionally with their customers, brand awareness became brand affinity.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 275
Not only do consumers object to interruption, but they hate being played.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 290
Classical marketing theory asserts this premise: Human beings are rational decision makers who, when faced with an important choice, gather relevant facts, weigh alternatives, then choose the best option. Therefore, to persuade consumers, present your claims in a factual, logical, scientific manner.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 293
Rhetoric imitates science by presenting evidence and drawing a conclusion, but the difference is that science weighs all evidence, both for and against a theorem; rhetoric slants its argument by laying out only the evidence that supports its claim,</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 295
science seeks the truth; rhetoric seeks the win. Marketing, in essence, is a public forum for rhetorical debate, a platform to persuade the</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 296
consumer that one product’s features outperform another’s.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 300
Do you remember where you learned to use rhetorical persuasion? How to argue using inductive and deductive logic? Writing junior high school essays. Do you remember your seventh-grade syllogism lesson?</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 308
As the savvy prospective buyer scans the chart, he knows two things: (1) The company self-selected only those categories in which its brand scores best. (2) Categories in which the product scored worse than the competition were left off the list.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 310
Now more than ever, marketing via rhetorical argument provokes skepticism in the mind of the customer and a negative attitude toward your product or service.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 322
If the inductive logic of rhetoric delivers suboptimized marketing results, why do businesses still gravitate toward it? First, education.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 326
Second, the prestige of science. Business leaders strive for scientific planning and choice making, for predictability and precision.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 328
The fundamental problems never change: how to capture attention, hold it, and reward it; in short, how to</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 329
turn people on, not off. 2. Emotional Communication</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 330
At the heart of an effective creative philosophy is the belief that nothing is so powerful as an insight into human nature, what compulsions drive a man, what instincts dominate his action, even though his language so often camouflages what really motivates him. —Bill Bernbach</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 337
According to one biography, Bernbach spoke to clients “. . . not of advertising, but the art of persuasion. To persuade the consumer, the creators of ads needed to touch people’s basic, unchanging instincts—their ‘obsessive drive to survive, to be admired, to succeed, to love, to take care of their own.’”4</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 340
The first step to mastering emotional manipulation is to realize that there are only two primary emotions, pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 348
As Paul Bloom, professor of psychology and behavioral science at Yale, explains in his book How Pleasure Works, “What matters most is not the world as it appears to our senses. Rather, the enjoyment (or suffering) we get from something derives from what we think that thing is.”7</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 351
Bloom claims that we are essentialists. Our response is conditioned by our beliefs of what things really are, what their essential nature is.8</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 357
But the Caltech study used an fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) device to observe the volunteers’ brain activity. The imaging revealed that when the participants drank what they believed to be a more expensive wine, the region of the brain linked to pleasure lit up.9 It wasn’t snobbery. They actually enjoyed greater</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 360
pleasure from the wines they believed were more expensive.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 365
The finding: Participants who believed they were shocked intentionally felt the shocks more painfully, and the pain lingered throughout the study. Those who believed that the shocks were unintentional experienced less pain and a quicker recovery.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 367
For both pleasure and pain, the meaning of the perception, not the sensory experience alone, determines how much pleasure or pain people experience. Because pleasure and pain are great motivators, creating these experiences within an ad promised to be marketing’s most powerful tool.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 369
Unfortunately, however, this insight devolved into the techniques of seduction and coercion. Seduction entices someone to do something with the promise of pleasure; coercion persuades</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 370
them to act with the threat of pain.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 377
screen. That’s why nearly two-thirds of millennials</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 380
What’s left? If emotional manipulation angers people, and if rhetorical persuasion strikes them as BS, how can you connect with your customers? How can you solve your marketing crisis?</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 383
We advocate a solution that’s tens of thousands of years old, the mode of communication that best fits the mind, that best connects one mind with another, that wraps the clarity of a rational message inside an emotional package and delivers it with sticking power: story.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 386
Emotional because we empathize with its characters; meaningful because the actions of our protagonist deliver insights into human nature.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 389
Many assume that because they’ve seen and heard a lifetime</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 389
of stories, they could easily create one. But that’s like thinking you can compose music because you’ve been to concerts.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 392
great stories have the power to change how humanity sees reality.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 392
Storified truths have built civilizations and religions that billions follow.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 394
called out</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 395
thanks to storified marketing, innovative brands can tell stories that change how their consumers view the world, and blow past their competition when they do.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 396
In short, story is the ultimate I.T. I in that storytelling demands information—a wide and deep knowledge of human nature and its relationship with the social and physical realms. T in that a well-told story demands skillful execution of its inner technology, its mechanisms of action/reaction, changing value charges, roles, conflicts, turning points, emotional dynamics, and much more. A craft underpins the art. Story structure, as we’ll see in the next chapter, is intrinsic to the human mind. Why then do we need to learn its craft? Isn’t storytelling natural? By the same token, children can sketch stick figures. Isn’t drawing also natural? Yes, both are, but to achieve excellence, authors and painters move beyond instinct to experiment and master their craft anew.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 405
If you study story technique, you can learn to hook, hold, and reward your audience’s attention, as do the finest of films, plays, and novels. If you refine these skills, you can build bonds of loyalty between your brand and your clients. And finally,</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 407
if you master storified marketing, as did the likes of Apple, Red Bull, Dove, and GE, your brand will, like theirs, resonate around the world.</p>

Then beginning two to three million years ago, severe planetary changes forced the central nervous systems of anthropoid bipeds to add brain matter, gray and white, at an average rate of one milliliter every three thousand years.3</p>

The silent awareness of “Me” suddenly transformed a brain into a mind and turned an animal human. Animals react to the objects around them, but the human brain turned itself into an object. Consciousness, in effect, split itself in two.</p>

When self-awareness invaded the first human mind, it brought with it a sudden, sharp sense of isolation. The cost of self-consciousness is a life spent essentially alone, at a distance from all other living things, even your fellow human creatures. With that first, primordial I am moment,</p>

Prior to self-awareness, our Pliocene ancestors, like all animals, lived in the corporeal comfort of a perpetual present. But when the sense of I am separated self-awareness from its primal instincts, visions of a painful future streaked through the newly minted human mind.6 What’s more, the mind discovered that not only is the future in doubt, but the surfaces of people and things cannot be trusted; that nothing is what it seems.

The mind, of course, does not convert every trivial change to story. Instead evolution has taught us to focus on meaningful, dynamic change. Storified thought interprets every event in terms of its core value. In story creation, however, the word value does not refer to mono-concepts such as success, truth, loyalty, love, or freedom. Those words name only half a value. Dynamic events affect our lives not as singularities but as binaries of positive/negative value charge. They pivot our lives around experiences of success/failure, truth/lie, loyalty/betrayal, love/hate, right/wrong, rich/poor,…

For an event to be meaningful, the mind must sense that the charge of at least one value has undergone change. The reason is obvious: If the charge of a value at stake in a situation does not change, what happens is a trivial activity of no significance.

<p>Orange highlight | Location: 491
value’s charge absolutely and the character’s life returns to balance.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 494
Thanks to storied thought, humanity learned how to survive with purpose and balance. As Kenneth Burke put it, story equips us to live.12 THE EIGHT POWERS</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 498
Self-Awareness: The power to distinguish the mind’s subjective, core self from its objective, public self and observe the outer self as if it were a separate personality.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 507
For the storyteller, other-awareness guides the creation of the characters that make the choices and take the actions that carry out the story. 3. Memory: The power to store and recall experience.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 509
The past makes the future in this way: Memory builds an understanding of people and the world by recording patterns of experience, stacking them one on top of another by what they have in common, and then telling itself, “This is how the world works.”</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 511
The mind then uses these patterns from the past in an effort to control the future by taking actions designed to make history repeat itself.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 515
4. Intelligence: The power to extract knowledge from both formal learning and everyday experience, and then apply deductive, inductive, and causal logics to reason to factual, truthful conclusions.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 518
Imagination: The power to reshape reality into undreamed-of possibilities.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 522
Insight: The power to see through appearances and perceive inner causalities.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 522
An insightful mind reads surface signs and then senses the hidden forces that move within and cause things to happen.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 523
Data, for example, only measures the outer results of what has changed; insight discovers how and why what has changed has changed.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 524
The storyteller, as we will see, uses this keen perspective to show us a world we think we understand, but then cracks open reality to first surprise us, then deliver a rush of insight into the hows and whys of that world and its characters. A lifetime of story-driven insights civilizes human beings, builds institutions, and makes culture viable.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 527
Correlation: The power to create. The correlating mind takes two things it already knows, and then seeks a hidden connection, a third thing that joins the two in a way no one else has ever seen before.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 533
Self-Expression: The power to perform.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 540
The mind builds stories to bridge the gap between itself and the universe, between itself and the past, present, and future.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 541
Story form imposes order on chaos;</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 541
seems to express the cause and effect of the is; it unifies events to</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 542
Knowledge expressed in story form gathers other human beings around its themes, uniting communities and building cultures.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 543
So, in the marketing context, the takeaway is this: Storified communication is the most powerful form of messaging because story fits the mind; story fits the mind because the mind converts actuality into story in the first place. It’s a tautology. As Hamlet says, “There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.”</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 553
Story, like art and music, is a word you think you understand until you try to define it.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 556
Reference books offer little help.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 561
Let’s clarify what story is by first looking at what it is not and eliminating any weak synonyms or false equivalents.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 562
STORY IS NOT A PROCESS</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 565
But unlike a story, a process has neither a desire nor a conflict nor a core character. As a result, no one’s life is touched or changed. A process accumulates; a story progresses.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 566
STORY IS NOT A HIERARCHY</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 568
For them, the corporate “story” describes how things get done, how decisions and tasks flow up and down the pyramid of power.</p>

time and space to fulfill her desire.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 578
STORY IS NOT A NARRATIVE</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 578
Many marketing campaigns have flopped because an ad agency didn’t know the difference between narrative and story.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 581
All stories are narratives, but not all narratives are stories.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 581
Narratives tend to be flat, bland, repetitive, and boring recitations of events.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 582
They slide through the mind like juice through a goose, and as a result, they have little or no influence on customers.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 583
Stories, on the other hand, are value-charged and progressive. The mind embraces a well-told story; the imagination is its natural home. Once through our mental door, story fits, sticks, and excites consumer choice. The next time you’re bored to the bone by somebody’s “story,” in all likelihood you’re not being told a story. If you were, you’d be listening and engrossed. Instead the guy is torturing you with a narrative, probably a repetitious recitation of “. . . and then I did this and then I did that and then I did the other thing and then and then and then…”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 588
What is a story, precisely? The essential core event in all stories ever told in the history of humanity can be expressed in just three words: Conflict changes life. Therefore, the prime definition becomes: a dynamic escalation of conflict-driven events that cause meaningful change in a character’s life.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 599
As with the arts of music and dance, the primary dimension of a story is time.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 604
Before an author composes his story, he needs a clear vision of his audience and the final effect his work will have on both their thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 607
the specific rational effect the storytellers aimed for was a deep understanding of the hows and whys behind the events.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 608
Their specific target of meaningful emotional satisfaction was the calm sense of gratification that comes when a quiet hero beats the odds</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 609
from behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 609
STAGE TWO: SUBJECT MATTER PRIME PRINCIPLE: BALANCE A story takes place at a specific time in a specific physical and social world. As the telling begins, the PROTAGONIST’s life is anchored in a core value that rests in a state of balance.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 615
The core value in Beane’s career—success/failure—rests in balance.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 616
STAGE THREE: THE INCITING INCIDENT PRIME PRINCIPLE: IMBALANCE The inciting incident is an unforeseen event that starts the story by upsetting the balance of the core character’s life. The neutral charge of its core value turns sharply positive or negative. Either way, this radical change puts the character under pressure.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 620
This inciting incident turns the balance of Beane’s life sharply to the positive.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 621
MONEYBALL’s inciting incident, however, also brings an unfortunate side effect:</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 625
STAGE FOUR: THE OBJECT OF DESIRE PRIME PRINCIPLE: AN UNFULFILLED NEED</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 626
When the CORE CHARACTER senses that the inciting incident has thrown his life out of balance and into jeopardy, he naturally wants to set life back on an even keel.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 633
STAGE SIX: THE FIRST REACTION PRIME PRINCIPLE: THE VIOLATION OF EXPECTATION</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 637
The Oakland A’s lose twenty-six of their first forty-six games. Art Howe attacks sabermetrics as a failure, and against Beane’s wishes, he fields the lineup he wants.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 639
STAGE SEVEN: THE CRISIS CHOICE PRIME PRINCIPLE: INSIGHT</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 641
a second action that’s more difficult, more risky than the first, yet one he hopes will cause a positive reaction that will finally get him what he wants.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 642
MONEYBALL: Beane trades away Howe’s star first baseman to force the</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 643
team manager to use Brand’s sabermetric choice.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 644
In a compact story, the protagonist’s second action causes a climactic reaction that matches his expectations and grants him his object of desire. This climax restores the core character’s life to balance and ends the story.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 648
Eight Stages of Story Design Stage One: Target Audience = A Meaningful Emotional Effect Stage Two: Subject Matter = Balance Stage Three: Inciting Incident = Imbalance Stage Four: Object of Desire = Need Stage Five: First Action = Tactical Choice Stage Six: First Reaction = Violation of Expectation Stage Seven: Crisis Choice = Insight Stage Eight: Climactic Reaction = Closure</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 658
Reversal by reversal, violation by violation, pressure mounts to the breaking point until he makes a crisis decision to take a final climactic action that irreversibly achieves or fails to achieve his object of desire.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 671
Fifth Action: In a flash of inspiration, he rebrands his company by taking on social causes that benefit his employees.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 674
Seventh Action: He gives his employees even greater benefits and then uses social media to market a new branding campaign that displays his pro-employee values.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 677
Ninth Action: Learning from his failure, he asks his customers what they want.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 679
Tenth Reaction/Climax and Closure: They give him his greatest success.</p>

<p>Blue highlight | Location: 680
Most marketing uses brief, compact stories. In the practical world of business, the brevity of advertising time, along with the high costs of creatives and production, confines marketing stories to one or two turning points. MEANING</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 682
First, at the core of all stories pulses at least one binary value—such as life/death, freedom/tyranny, success/failure, truth/lie, love/hate, and the like.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 686
Second, the dynamic of cause and effect within the story’s events expresses the hows and whys,</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 700
Writers of fiction for page, stage, and screen have little difficulty imagining their story’s buying public.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 703
At the end of the day, the professional writer judges his quality of work not by its effect on him, but by the degree to which the effect he hoped for affects his readers or audience.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 708
Subject matter for a story contains three major components: a physical and social setting, a protagonist, and a core value. Life offers the storyteller an infinite variety of each.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 710
In fact, more often than not, the spark of originality that ignites an exceptional story flashes through a creative’s imagination not while she daydreams, but as she sweats out the grunt work of founding her story-world and planting its setups.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 712
World-building, therefore, is storytelling’s critical second step.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 713
The weakest choices of all favor the general over the specific.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 716
The mind works best when it moves from the specific to the universal—not the other way around. Consider, for example, the phrase a piece of furniture.</p>
<p>Note:Important</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 718
particular. But if I say, “A wingback Duchess chair upholstered in blood-red leather,” a clear image glows in your mind. Instinctively, your imagination moves forward from this particular to the general, slotting the chair into the mental category “furniture.” This applies to all aspects of a story’s world, physical and social.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 720
Therefore, the principle: The more specific the setting, the more universal the story’s appeal.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 731
(1) Physical—the horizontal landscape and every object on it. (2) Social—the vertical hierarchy of a society’s pyramid of power and the possibility for movement up or down.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 736
Every physical setting contains a social setting as well, a cast of characters defined by demographic factors such as age, gender, income, employment, and ethnicity. What’s more, this cast lives in a culture defined first and foremost by its values—its ideality versus its reality, what its citizens believe they should do versus what in fact they do.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 739
THE CORE VALUE</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 743
But for the story-maker, the values he invests in his telling come not as singularities but binaries of positive/negative charge: truth/lie, love/hate, generosity/selfishness, hard work/laziness, loyalty/betrayal, life/death, courage/cowardice, hope/despair, meaningfulness/meaninglessness, maturity/immaturity, justice/injustice, and on the list goes, naming all those qualities of</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 745
human experience that can shift charge dynamically from positive to negative and back again.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 747
but it anchors its content in one irreplaceable binary—the story’s core value. This value determines a story’s fundamental meaning and emotion.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 754
The core value that pulses at the heart of a story determines its specific meaning and unique emotional impact.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 761
A core character must be empathetic; she or he may or may not be sympathetic.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 763
Empathetic means “like me”—an innate trait shared by both the core character and the target audience.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 764
Sympathy is optional, empathy essential, for this reason: Audience involvement hinges on an act of personal identification.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 765
Rather, the psychological bond of empathy only develops when an audience subconsciously identifies with a positive human quality emanating from within the character. This quality becomes the story’s center of good.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 768
The moment a story appears in front of audience members or readers, they instantly and instinctively inspect its value-charged landscape, seeking an emotional door into the story, a place to stick their empathy. They sort the positives from the negatives, the goods from the bads, the rights from the wrongs, the things of value from the things of no value. Everyone searches for a center of good because, in his heart of hearts, everyone instinctively sees himself as good.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 773
Therefore, all people, regardless of their humanity or lack of it, seek a positive glow somewhere in a story’s world, a mooring for their empathy.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 774
Ideally, the storyteller places this center of good within the protagonist so that a positive human quality emanates from within the core character and captures the audience’s personal involvement. This empathy magnet also anchors the mirror story, which we will explain in</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 779
Before a story begins, its physical setting, social setting, core value, and core character rest in a state of balance.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 791
First, it captures</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 792
As we pointed out earlier, the mind keys on change, and the inciting incident’s sudden pivot of the protagonist’s life sharply focuses the audience’s interest.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 794
When you think back, how many perfectly lousy stories have you sat through for no other reason than to get the answer to the nagging question: “How does this piece of dreck turn out?”</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 795
Third, when curiosity over the MDQ merges with empathy for the protagonist, a story generates the compelling magnetism known as suspense. Suspense doubles involvement. This blend of subjective identification with objective wonder magnifies a story’s power tenfold.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 804
the inciting incident arouses the natural human desire to regain control and restore balance.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 806
and so conceives of an object of desire,</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 806
This could be something physical like a hike in pay, a product innovation, or the right person</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 809
Nonetheless, all stories dramatize the essential human struggle to move life from chaos to order, from imbalance to equilibrium.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 810
We measure the worth of the object of desire in terms of risk: the greater the risk, the greater the object’s worth. What would you risk your time for? What would you risk your life for? What would you risk your soul for? The most compelling objects of desire come with the highest price tags, and the greater the object’s worth, the greater the involvement. Contrariwise, watching a character pursue something of no real value is the definition of boredom.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 815
storytelling becomes the art of merging and organizing many streams of want into a flow of events that aims at a single object of desire.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 823
These desires not only cement the status quo of a character’s life but also temper his behavior. Background desires form the web of restraints that follow every character into every scene. These fixed desires for stability limit the character’s actions, restraining what he may or may not say or do to get what he wants.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 826
Desire answers what questions: What does the character consciously want? What does he subconsciously long for? Motivation answers why questions. Why does a character want what he wants? Why does he want his particular object of desire?</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 828
The roots of human motivation reach deep into childhood and, for that reason, are often irrational.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 830
Biographers of historical figures—Charles Darwin, Eleanor Roosevelt, Picasso—devote chapter upon chapter detailing the upbringing of each, trying to</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 831
document the precise childhood experiences that motivated these personages to do the great things they did.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 832
Shakespeare, on the other hand, never mentions motivation.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 834
STAGE FIVE: THE FIRST ACTION PRIME PRINCIPLE: TACTICAL CHOICE</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 835
Desire demands deeds.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 836
This positive/negative dynamic propels his story to climax.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 838
Every human being acts from one moment to the next on his personal sense of probability, on what he feels will probably happen when he does what he intends to do next.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 843
From his quiver of personal tactics, he draws strategic behaviors, all in an effort to move toward his desire of the moment and long-term hopes.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 844
And because, like everyone else, he is one of a kind, his sense of what will probably happen when he takes an action will also be one of a kind; therefore, his choice of tactic (exact words, gestures, facial expressions, and so on) will, in turn, be one of a kind.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 847
It’s this infinitude of idiosyncratic tactics that inspires storytellers to imagine unique characters, the sort found in the best-told stories, with behaviors like no one else’s, behaviors that fascinate.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 849
Evolution programmed the genes of every living thing to conserve life down to the last calorie of energy, take no uncalled-for risks, and yet pursue all necessary desires. Therefore, human nature, as a part of Mother Nature, always takes the conservative, minimal, and yet sufficient action in an effort to get what it wants.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 853
A character will never do less than she has to, nor will she ever do more than she needs to; instead, she will take the minimal, conservative, yet sufficient action that she believes will move her closer to a balanced life.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 856
Ninety-nine percent of our actions cause the responses we more or less expect.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 859
To create a meaningful emotional experience for his audience, the storyteller evicts all empty moments, all trivialities and banalities, and embraces those events, and only those events, that bring value-charged change.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 860
To create value-charged change, the storyteller pits the core character’s sense of probability against reality’s forces of necessity.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 867
When a character’s world suddenly reacts differently and/or more powerfully than he imagined, this violation of expectation delivers a jolt of surprise, followed by a rush of insight. The clash between what he thinks will happen and the result he actually gets jolts him and splits open his reality.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 869
The character stares, as it were, into the gap between his subjective anticipation and its objective result. Then with a rush of insight, he suddenly glimpses how his world actually works; how its unforeseen forces of antagonism now block his path.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 873
When an unanticipated, even contradictory, obstacle violates a protagonist’s expectations, it moves him farther from his object of desire than he was before he acted.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 887
Inner Obstacles: Contradictory forces within a character’s body, emotions, and mind with its warring conscious and subconscious desires.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 891
To turn a scene means to change its value charge; the phrase turning point names the precise moment when an unforeseen force of antagonism violates expectations and pivots the value at stake from positive to negative or negative to positive.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 893
Turning points trigger change in only one of two ways—either by a direct action followed by the reaction it sparks, or by a revelation of a secret or previously unknown fact and the response it unleashes.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 898
The Rational Effects of TURNING POINTS A violation of expectation is, in essence, an effect with an unknown cause. As a result, turning points pop questions into the mind such as “Why have things taken this unforeseen turn? Why didn’t the character see this coming? Why didn’t I? What caused this startling twist?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 901
A turning point punches a hole in reality. Curiosity</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 901
compels the audience members to fill the hole with knowledge, so their thoughts rush back through previous scenes and images, looking for an unseen cause, trying to solve the mystery of “Why?” The answer has been planted beneath the story’s setups. The moment the audience glimpses this hidden truth, it erupts with an “Oh, yeah, now I get it!” insight that both delights and enlightens.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 911
As Aristotle observed, the deepest audience pleasure is learning without being taught. When a tale dramatizes its meaning skillfully, the audience feels no mental strain and yet comes away with a fuller understanding of the workings of the world and the human heart.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 916
the like. The mind’s ranking process keys on the potential for change. So long as life’s conditions run in neutral, the mind pays no attention and goes about its many tasks. But when things change, awareness snaps to alert as our animal instincts warn us that change threatens survival.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 922
Emotion, therefore, is the side effect of change. When the mind senses change from negative to positive, it releases pleasure-giving chemicals; if the mind registers a movement from positive to negative, it unleashes a painful flow.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 926
Ad Age named “Real Beauty” one of the top five ad campaigns of the century.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 928
In 2013, Hugo Veiga created a video titled Dove Real Beauty Sketches.2 The story follows a group of women who volunteer for an odd experiment: They agree to have their portrait done by a sketch artist who cannot see them. Instead they will simply tell him what they look like. This act of courage immediately draws empathy from the audience.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 936
The above graphic tracks the emotional dynamics in the Dove Real Beauty Sketches video. Its turning points swivel between the opposing poles of its core value, from self-criticism to self-appreciation.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 946
The story climaxes on the doubly positive charge of self-appreciation. During this decisive transition, the audience shares in the women’s triumph over self-criticism and feels, with them, a positive emotion.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 948
All well-told stories express how and why life changes, and, as we noted above,</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 948
the side effect of change is emotion.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 949
These feelings, however, only come to life during a transition. As a story shifts from positive to negative, the audience feels a dark emotion; as it transitions from negative to positive, a light emotion fills them. Once change completes itself, however, emotion quickly dissipates, ready to move in a new direction. To grip and hold emotional involvement, a story’s values must transition dynamically from change to change to change.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 957
Faced with an array of possible actions, she must choose one last tactic in a final effort to put life back in balance.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 958
Decisions come in two kinds: clear choices versus dilemmas—the easy versus the hard.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 960
Clear choices obey nature’s grand imperative: Always choose the positive.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 961
Every living thing, flora and fauna, instinctively heeds the two laws governing the conservation of energy and life: (1) Never do anything you don’t have to do if you can get what you want the easier way. (2) Never take any risk you don’t have to take if you can get what you want the safer way.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 968
Dilemmas also come in two kinds, and both are hard because they pose a choice between either two positives or two negatives, known respectively as irreconcilable goods and the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 972
The hard choice of dilemma causes anxiety before the choice and risk during it.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 975
But as we’ll see in the next chapter, in the marketer’s purpose-told story, the protagonist’s climactic choice must be pressure-and stress-free.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,013
Unlike full-length fictions, purpose-told stories abbreviate events. The typical business story is a mini-tale told in a thirty-second commercial or a three-minute YouTube video. GE’s “Owen” ads and the Dove Real Beauty Sketches are two perfect examples of each.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,016
The marketing story, no. Purpose-told works crack open the gap between expectation and result usually only once, perhaps twice, maybe three times at the most.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,028
The purpose-told’s audience members take their storified experience into the real world and relive it each and every time they purchase the subject product or service. In other words, the purpose of the purpose-told story is to transform the aesthetic pleasure of a story’s climax into a viable action in the marketplace—to turn audiences into consumers.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,032
we gain an insight into life we never knew before, all enveloped in emotions we never felt quite that way before. This fusion of idea and emotion adds a measure of enrichment, great or small, to our inner life. We exit a beautifully told story a fuller human being than when we entered.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,035
The fiction-told story fulfills itself in one telling, whereas the purpose-told story retells its tale in the mind of the consumer each and every time she buys its product or hires its service.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,038
Concentrated experiences entertain because they carry us through time unaware of the passage of time.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,047
The audience of the purpose-told story, on the other hand, ignores the artist and feels brand loyalty instead. Brand loyalty, and the lifetime of purchases that comes with it, is created by the mirror experience at the heart of the purpose-told story. THE MIRROR EXPERIENCE Well-told stories create two simultaneous experiences that mirror each other: one mental, the other emotional. The mental mirror experience begins and ends with curiosity. A story’s inciting incident teases the audience’s mind with unanswered questions such as “What’s going to happen next? What’ll happen after that? How will this story turn out? Will the protagonist win his object of desire?” The rational mirror experience in story mirrors the same set</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,059
First, the identification. The moment the target consumer recognizes a shared humanity between herself and the protagonist, her instincts follow the logic of kinship: “That character is a human being like me. Therefore, I want that character to get what he wants, because if I were that character in that situation, I would want the same thing for myself.” In other words, she bonds.2</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,065
She instinctively experiences the events as if they were happening to her.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,067
Third, the reenactment. The consumer’s mirror experience motivates her to act. Wishing to relive the positive charge of the purpose-told story, she purchases the product or hires the service embedded in the telling. Her post-story reenactment satisfies her need and the marketer’s purpose simultaneously. In short, she becomes a customer.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,074
The mind memorizes the patterns of cause and effect that underlie real-life past events so it can strategize its future actions. As events impact us over the years, we gather knowledge of how things work, how the various forces in our world interconnect. When new situations arise, the mind draws on these past patterns to imagine the possible tactics it might take and predict the probable reactions these actions might cause.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,077
This process of linking previous encounters to future outcomes underlies not only factual but also fictional experience.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,082
Each person acts on her unique sense of probability, what her sum total of personal experience, actual and fictional, tells her will probably happen when she chooses to act.</p>

Consider, for example, the storified marketing campaign that saved a brand from virtual extinction, “Real Beauty” by Dove. As we demonstrated in the emotion-creation section of the previous chapter, this insight into the target audience’s inciting incident and resulting object of desire inspired Ogilvy &amp; Mather to weave a purpose-told story around the core value of self-criticism versus self-appreciation.

fact, for many business stories, the only logical choice for protagonist is a product or a corporation. If so, the tale must be told from that point of view. To do so, however, the storyteller faces this challenging problem: How can I fuse an empathetic connection between consumer and protagonist when the latter is either an inanimate object or an impersonal institution?</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 1,168
Fantasy worlds and characters demand imagination, innovation, and creative execution. Rather than face that task, many campaigns abandon storytelling in favor of a spokesperson bragging and making promises the product’s performance may or may not be able to keep.</p>

To turn a corporation into an empathetic protagonist, the marketer first must identify the company’s primal value, a value so essential to its nature that if it were lost, the company would disappear with it.</p>

But no matter how you characterize your protagonist, his reaction to the inciting incident should draw the audience’s empathy and emotional concern, placing him at the story’s center of good.</p>

How does this object of desire relate to the core value (for example, just/unjust or rich/poor) of the story? And by extension, how does the story’s core value relate to my company’s core value? Your answers need not match perfectly, but they cannot be divorced. Values and desires must reflect each other and thus unify the story with the company that produces it.</p>

In the case of the Spanish lottery story, the son arrives to find his grandmother celebrating on the street with their neighbor, one of the other ticket holders who shares her number.

Developing a compelling story means developing a conflict that relates to your audience, mirroring the positive/negative duality of their lives. Think about it. Life fills our hours with problems to be solved, needs to be met, desires to be satisfied—not enough time to get the job done, too far to go to get what you need, a romance on the rocks, an illness that resists cure.</p>

The creative force that rouses powerful storytelling is, as Jean-Paul Sartre taught, scarcity.</p>

Marketing stories move from problem to solution, not solution to solution to solution. A positive climax demands a negative setup. For no matter how happy a happy ending may be, if nothing but uplifting scenes precede it, redundancy erases those images from the audience’s memory.</p>

<p>Orange highlight | Location: 1,317
Why do so many product and service ads deliver little, if any, impact? Answer: because their tellings deliberately avoid any hint of conflict. And why is that? Answer: negaphobia.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 1,319
Negaphobia is a by-product of marketing education. Ever since the invention of the business school, and marketing as a unique discipline within its curriculum, marketers have been trained, as the old song goes, to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 1,323

<p>Orange highlight | Location: 1,332
To preempt blame, marketing executives cover their butts by outlawing the least hint of anything negative in their ads. As an unfortunate result, negaphobia not only distorts their business judgment, but also sucks the impact out of their messaging.</p>

A compelling marketing story encompasses the negative of life.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 1,335
And the story must establish its negative floor either in Stage Two, when the inciting incident imbalances the protagonist’s life, or here in Stage Six as the story’s forces of antagonism suddenly react against the protagonist.</p>

<p>Orange highlight | Location: 1,339
Consumers love to realize the truth in this spontaneous, storified way. They want to be shown, not told. They don’t want to sit in a classroom; they want a surprising living discovery.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 1,340
This insight puts the consumer’s mirror story on a path to solution and the satisfaction of her need. She doesn’t know how it will be done, but it’s out there, so she can’t look away. This curiosity holds your prospect’s attention, even in a world of constant distraction. Marketing stories are generally brief. The protagonist pursues her object of desire through usually only one turning point.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 1,348
Stage Seven brings the story to its crisis, the highest level of tension and suspense. The protagonist, based on her new knowledge, chooses a new tactic, one she hopes will create a reaction from her world that will deliver her object of desire.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Location: 1,350
At this point in most fiction-told stories, the protagonist stands in dilemma, forced to choose between either two irreconcilable positive possibilities or two equally repugnant negative choices. Never in a marketing story. Rather, the insight the protagonist gained in Stage Six now gives her a clear choice of what to do to get what she wants. She conceives her new tactic and takes it.</p>

Stage Eight delivers the goods. The protagonist’s second action evokes a positive reaction from his world, giving him his object of desire and reestablishing the balance of his life.</p>

but also dramatizes how they can solve the mirror problem in their own lives—how they, too, can get what they need and desire.</p>

“December 21st” ends with a final twist. Before the son can break the truth to the grandmother, she stops him, saying, “I know what you are going to say.” He sighs, thinking she has already figured it out and been let down. Instead she reaches into her pocket and hands him her “winning” lottery ticket, saying, “But you should always listen to your mother. And I will be much happier if you have this.”</p>

Now that we have reviewed the eight stages of story, it’s important to note that not every marketing story needs to take its audience through all eight stages explicitly. The mind, as we noted, is a story-taking and -making machine.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,428
Your first task as change agent is to educate your executive team on the worldwide shift from ad-centric to story-centric marketing. No small task. Conventional C-suite wisdom holds that six-year-olds crave stories, while hard-charging executives don’t. But you know that if your company doesn’t change its MO, it won’t survive, so you must build a winning case to convince the C-suite.</p>

Change your team’s marketing theory to embrace emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,470
The key to decision making is emotion, and emotion is not information. The emotionally targeted question you should ask is: “How do I want my customers to feel?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,472
Your team members must frame their stories to create a feeling of fusion between protagonist and audience. When empathy seals the deal, use progressive conflict and value charge changes to hook and hold your audience, and finally reward it with a story climax that reinforces brand or product values.</p>

Every CMO starts his day staring at this hard truth: Nobody wants to hear about your company or your product.</p>

Typically, consumers only debate brands in the mental minute just before they make a purchase. That precious minute makes storified branding an imperative for modern marketing.</p>

Brand is a single organizing idea, a higher-order construct that everything else comes from and aligns with. Sometimes I liken it to the fresh water that makes everything else possible, whether that is growing your crops or cleaning your clothes or making soup. It’s that ingredient that goes across everything else.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,503
Finding a fresh source of water that won’t be depleted and can be used in hundreds and hundreds of ways is a challenge. Which is to say [brand] is intangible, it is abstract, and it is true. It has to be all of those things at</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,505
The job of the marketer is to make it tangible and real and to work with its truth to tell a story that is compelling whether it happens in one image or three lines or a long-form piece.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,506
All of that is in service of saying we want brands to be a link between a number of positive associations for the consumer, and increasingly for communities and constituencies beyond the consumer, to say that we can all come together around this one big higher-order idea.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,508

Originally, Davis pointed out, brands were simply a means of identifying the producer.</p>

How can you create a brand that matters so much to people that they make it part of their self-expression? For generations, television advertising did the trick. Not anymore.

Once you determine your audience (Stage One of the storytelling process), you must choose subject matter that contains a physical and social setting, a core value, and a protagonist (Stage Two).

Now imagine if GE’s ads said that directly: As the company logo fills the TV screen, a voice intones, “We at GE create the software that connects the biggest and best machines of this world.” Would audiences believe it? Or care? Doubtful. The Owen stories touch emotions bragging could never reach. That’s power.</p>

PUT A STORY WITHIN THE STORY</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,751
The mind jumps from story to story rather easily. For example, when viewers change channels in search of something good, or when story lines crosscut from central plot to subplot and back, audience engagement switches gears in a heartbeat. Story always feels welcome.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,753
So when your ad interrupts one story with another, the transition seems relatively smooth, but when you break deep,</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,754
ongoing narrative involvement with a bragging/promising sales pitch, people hate it and ignore it.</p>

The modern marketer must offer her customers unique, valued, and, most important, fluid, nonstop experiences. In the same way that media companies built and maintained their audiences for decades, brands, too, must tell stories at a sustained pace to earn the respect of their customers and keep it.</p>

Many senior marketers arrive on the job to find they do not have time to invest in branding. Their company needs demand generation (B2C) or lead generation (B2B) to achieve quarterly results.</p>

Historically, in tight quarters CMOs would ramp up the advertising budget to meet revenue goals, or cut the budget to meet earnings. But with the rapid decline of advertising reach and efficacy, they need to turn somewhere new. To understand how brands can drive consumers to purchase and business buyers to engage with sales teams, we need to consider how people discover and consume information and entertainment today.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,803
Instead online searches drive their active discovery, while social media provides for passive discovery.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,807
Over the same four weeks, thirty billion people with no specific goal follow curiosity where it leads to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Snapchat, or Pinterest, and by pure coincidence learn something interesting, something of value.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,809
These chance revelations often feel like a gift from beyond, so people share their passive discoveries with friends and family, compounding these serendipities from thirty to ninety billion.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,810
These tens of billions of discoveries offer an unprecedented marketing opportunity, if you provide the information or entertainment your customers seek.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,813
This means that like blank billboards along a highway, search and social discoveries offer CMOs new ways to reach customers and build ongoing relationships,</p>

What’s more, when someone arrives on your website, what’s the first thing he sees? Your products? Your logo? Your slogan? A list of claims? Really? Never underestimate the power of first impressions. When your customer first arrives, consider giving him a gift.</p>

Content marketing creates material your customers want or need, instead of repeating messages describing the features and benefits of your company or products.</p>

Today one of the highest honors awarded any restaurateur is a “Michelin Star.” Not bad for a tire company.</p>

As The Furrow and the Michelin Guide demonstrate, the strategy of content marketing has been, since its inception, simplicity itself: First, give them a gift.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,828
If a visitor’s first impression of your brand is a captivating video or a fascinating piece of writing that tells a story rooted in nature, science, history, or some other new and interesting subject matter, this surprise gift opens the door to your store. Now she’s inside, looking around, and your visitor moves from anonymous consumer to prospect. Let your sales team take her the next step from prospect to customer.</p>

First, the Oral Care Center team finds the topics customers search most and then creates content to match. They ensure each article is optimized to rank well against search queries.7 By search optimizing content, Colgate.com creates an experience that ends the search. Customers find what they need. Every month Colgate.com broadens its audience and builds relationships that last. Second, Colgate does not use the Oral Care Center to promote the benefits of Colgate products. Brands lose credibility when they shift the focus of their content from helping the customer back to the bragging and promising of yesteryear.</p>

Companies evolve into content marketing leaders when they move from sustained content creation to sustained storytelling.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,884
Caleb Barlow, VP IBM Security, explained their unique marketing challenge: “What we have is a very technical issue, a very complex issue, and in some cases a very scary issue that we need to be able to describe to people in order to get them to act. We’re not talking about products, like a collaboration system,</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,886
that you log in to and use all day every day. We’re talking about products that, hopefully, you never see as an end user, and in some cases hopefully you never need to use. But boy, you’d better make sure they’re there when you need them. So storytelling becomes extraordinarily important.”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,894
The resulting property, IBM’s award-winning SecurityIntelligence.com, breaks news on hacks, malware, data theft, and software vulnerabilities that can put enterprises at risk, and analyzes how others can avoid the same attacks.9 Hundreds of thousands of CISOs, CIOs, and CTOs visit and return to that property each month and are grateful to IBM for the help.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,897
Caleb Barlow knows that a company loses credibility when it brags about itself or makes promises about its products.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,898
So the vast majority of the content on SecurityIntelligence.com does not mention IBM, its products, or its solutions. Instead IBM simply provides the information that IT professionals need to do their job. As a result, some believe IBM’s credibility on IT security ranks higher than any traditional news source.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,905
“If you’re buying a security product,</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,905
it’s kind of like buying a child seat for your kid: You’re not interested in second best,” Barlow explained. “It’s practical, but it’s also emotional.”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,907
When C-suite executives decide it’s time to make new investments to keep their company safe, their first call goes to IBM Security because the brand became their trusted adviser through the stories shared on SecurityIntelligence.com.10 This is the secret all content marketing leaders know very well.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,911
The core value of the story must align with the core value of the brand.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,914
When we apply story form to demand/lead generation marketing, however, we apply the same form differently. In demand/lead generation stories, the protagonist will typically be a customer or prospective customer. The inciting incident will occur, at least in part, because the protagonist is not using the product/service your company offers.</p>

To use a story that ends on the negative effectively, marketers turn to comedy, as does Adobe. In comedy, the cardinal rule is that nobody actually gets hurt. If you do not employ comedy, you risk creating negative feelings about your brand—</p>

Original, sustainable story-driven content creation is not easy. Marketers with this ambition must develop a strategy, license a content marketing platform (CMP), recruit creatives, and implement a process for managing, reviewing, and improving that content every day. A regular publishing cadence of well-told stories requires time, money, and resources.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,940
For that reason, some marketers cut corners and try to license or curate instead. Licensing content means that</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,941
they pay a fee to media companies for the rights to pre-written stories or pre-produced videos. Curation eliminates fees by simply citing media stories and sending audiences to the original source.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,943
Although content licensing and curating are cheap and fast, both are inherently flawed. If you use either means, how can you differentiate yourself from your competitors? What’s to stop your competition from emulating you, using the same content from the same sources? And most important, if you curate or license, how do you demonstrate thought leadership and expertise the way IBM Security does?</p>

“Technology is radically reshaping how we work and how we interact with our colleagues. With over 21,000 employees in offices in 140 countries, we’re on the front lines with our clients, studying that change and defining how companies adapt to and capitalize on it.</p>

“Today there is intense competition for talent.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,954
[Millennials] know how quickly the world is changing, so they care much more about ongoing education and new skills development</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,954
than Gen Xers did when they entered the workforce. Companies can’t just present traditional benefits packages to this generation; they need to show them how they will prepare them for career mobility in the future.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,961
When a brand licenses or curates from various sources, it loses its voice.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,962
Every media company you might license content from writes in its own voice, from its own perspective, speaking with its own tone. “What we write has to be quintessentially Mercer,”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,963
“If it’s not, we aren’t building a relationship with our customer.”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 1,964
To succeed, tell original stories regularly and consistently in your own voice. Do this and do it well and you, too, will become a leader in content marketing. Shortcuts won’t work.</p>

On May 17, 2014, the New York Times reported that NBC-Universal had licensed the broadcast rights for the six Olympic Games spanning the years between 2022 and 2032. NBC paid $7.75 billion and secured not just the television rights, but what the Times described as “exclusive rights to broadcast the Games on whatever technology emerges between now and then.”</p>

Smaller companies with tighter budgets have no choice; they cannot afford to spend precious capital on advertising that yields less each year. Their future hinges on their mastery of the storytelling craft.</p>

Amazon executives were having so much fun designing PowerPoint slides, they never bothered to figure out how</p>

things actually worked, how one thing caused another. They just glossed over ideas, flattened out priorities, and ignored the interconnectedness of forces within Amazon itself, as well as among Amazon, the market, technology, and both national and international politics. Bezos needed wide-ranging complex minds, in-depth thinking, executives with broad, long-term insight. So in June 2004 he sent his Senior Team (S-team) the following memo:</p>

Humanity’s first stories were danced and chanted around the fire in caves, as tribal leaders passed their knowledge from generation to generation. Ancient civilizations inscribed their myths and legends on the walls of temples and pyramids, carving them in stone to be read for eons. Like the timeless epics of Homer and the beloved novels of Charles Dickens, wonderful stories are not just told, they’re retold, again and again. Great storytelling attracts crowds into the future.

Robert Frost’s beautiful and memorable poem, “The Road Not Taken”:   Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; . . . I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.</p>

Twenty-five years of research in seventeen different organizations has taught us that individuals who are the most influential—who can get things done and at the same time build on relationships—are those who master their crucial conversations.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 10
high performers know how to stand up to the boss without committing career suicide. We’ve all seen people hurt their careers by ineffectively discussing tough issues.</p>

You may have done it yourself. Fed up with a lengthy and unhealthy pattern of behavior, you finally speak out—but a bit too abruptly. Oops. Or maybe an issue becomes so hot that as your peers twitch and fidget themselves into a quivering mass of potential stroke victims, you decide to say something. It’s not a pretty discussion—but somebody has to have the guts to keep the boss from doing something stupid. (Gulp.)</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 10
You don’t have to choose between candor and your career.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 10
People who routinely hold crucial conversations and hold them well are able to express controversial and even risky opinions in a way that gets heard. Their bosses, peers, and direct reports listen without becoming defensive or angry.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 10
Are there crucial conversations that you’re not holding or not holding well? Is</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 10
this undermining your influence? And more importantly, would your career take a step forward if you could improve how you’re dealing with these conversations?</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 11
We wondered, “Are there a handful of moments when someone’s actions disproportionately affect key performance indicators?” And if so, what are those moments and how should we act when they occur?</p>

In a study of over 7,000 doctors and nurses, we’ve found caregivers face this crucial moment all the time.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 11
And that’s not the problem! The real problem is that those who observe deviations or infractions say nothing.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 11
Across the world we’ve found that the odds of a nurse speaking up in this crucial moment are less than one in twelve. The odds of doctors stepping up to similar crucial conversations aren’t much better.</p>

that their people work in silos. They do great at tasks that are handled entirely within their team. Unfortunately, close to 80 percent of the projects that require cross-functional cooperation cost far more than expected, produce less than hoped for, and run significantly over budget. We wondered why.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 12
For example, could they speak up if they thought the scope and schedule were</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 12
unrealistic? Or did they go silent when a cross-functional team member began sloughing off? Or even more tricky—what should they do when an executive failed to provide leadership for the effort?</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 12
In most organizations, employees fell silent when these crucial moments hit.</p>

Those who can’t handle their crucial conversations suffer in thirteen different ways (backstabbing, gossip, undermining, passive aggression, etc.) as much as three times more often in virtual teams than in colocated teams (Research Study: Long-Distance Loathing). • Influence change in colleagues who are bullying, conniving, dishonest, or incompetent. When nearly 1,000 respondents were asked, 93 percent of them said that, in their organization, people like this are almost “untouchable”—staying in their position four years or longer without being held accountable</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 13
(Research Study: Corporate Untouchables).</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 13
The key to real change lies not in implementing a new process, but in getting people to hold one another accountable to the process.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 13
And that requires Crucial Conversations skills.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 13
In the worst companies, poor performers are first ignored and then transferred. In good companies, bosses eventually deal with problems. In the best companies, everyone holds everyone else accountable—regardless of level or position. The path to high productivity passes not through a static system, but through face-to-face conversations.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 14
issues. But not everyone splits up. It’s how you argue that matters.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 14
For example, when our colleague, Howard Markman, examined couples in the throes of heated discussions, he learned that people fall into three categories—those who digress into threats and name-calling, those who revert to silent fuming, and those who speak openly, honestly, and effectively.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 15
Those who routinely failed their crucial conversations had far weaker immune systems than those who found a way to resolve them well.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 16
We could go on for pages about how the ability to hold crucial conversations has an impact on your personal health.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 16
“You’re saying that the way you talk or don’t talk affects your body? It could kill you?”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 16
So how about you? What are the specific conversations that gnaw at you the most? Which conversations (if you held them or improved them) would strengthen your immune system, help ward off disease, and increase your quality of life and well-being?</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 18
When stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions start to run strong, casual conversations transform into crucial ones.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 18
Ironically, the more crucial the conversation, the less likely we are to handle it well.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 18
And now for the good news. As we learn how to step up to crucial conversations—and handle them well—with one set of high-leverage skills we can influence virtually every domain of our lives.</p>

One of the opinion leaders we became particularly interested in meeting was named Kevin. He was the only one of eight vice presidents in his company to be identified as exceedingly influential. We wanted to know why. So we watched him at work. At first, Kevin didn’t do anything remarkable. In truth, he looked like every other VP. He answered his phone, talked to his direct reports, and continued about his pleasant, but routine, routine.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 20
team. No vague claim went unclarified, no unsupported reasoning unquestioned.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 21
Kevin continued to explain what he saw happening, and when he finished the first minutes of this delicate exchange, Chris was quiet for a moment. Then he nodded his head. “You’re absolutely right,” he finally concluded. “I have been trying to force my opinion on you. Let’s back up and try again.”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 21
“Did you see how he did that? If you want to know how he gets things done, figure out what he just did.”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 21
So we did. In fact, we spent the next twenty-five years discovering what Kevin and people like him do. What typically set them apart from the rest of the pack was their ability to avoid what we came to call the Fool’s Choice.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 22
The mistake most of us make in our crucial conversations is we believe that we have to choose between telling the truth and keeping a friend.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 22
Consider Kevin, the all-star. When he took a breath and opened his mouth, his overriding question was, “How can I be 100 percent honest with Chris, and at the same time be 100 percent respectful?”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 22
They not only refused to make the Fool’s Choice, but they then acted in ways that were far more skilled than their colleagues.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 23
When it comes to risky, controversial, and emotional conversations, skilled people find a way to get all relevant information (from themselves and others) out into the open.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 23
At the core of every successful conversation lies the free flow of relevant information. People openly and honestly express their opinions, share their feelings, and articulate their theories. They willingly and capably share their views, even when their ideas are controversial or unpopular. It’s the one thing that, and precisely what, Kevin and the other extremely effective communicators we studied were routinely able to achieve. Now, to put a label on this spectacular talent—it’s called dialogue.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 23
di·a·logue or di·a·log (dì´ ∂-lôg´´, -lòg) n The free flow of meaning between two or more people.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 24
Each of us enters conversations with our own opinions, feelings, theories, and experiences about the topic at hand. This unique combination of thoughts and feelings makes up our personal pool of meaning. This pool not only informs us, but also propels our every action.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 24
People who are skilled at dialogue do their best to make it safe for everyone to add their meaning to the shared pool—even ideas that at first glance appear controversial, wrong, or at odds with their own beliefs. Now, obviously, they don’t agree with every idea; they simply do their best to ensure that all ideas find their way into the open.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 24
As the Pool of Shared Meaning grows, it helps people in two ways. First, as individuals are exposed to more accurate and relevant information, they make better choices.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 24
In a very real sense, the Pool of Shared Meaning is a measure of</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 24
a group’s IQ. The larger the shared pool, the smarter the decisions. And even though many people may be involved in a choice, when people openly and freely share ideas, the increased time investment is more than offset by the quality of the decision.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 24
On the other hand, we’ve all seen what happens when the shared pool is dangerously shallow. When people purposefully withhold meaning from one another, individually smart people can do collectively stupid things.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 25
Of course, hospitals don’t have a monopoly on fear. In every instance where bosses are smart, highly paid, confident, and outspoken (i.e., most of the world), people tend to hold back their opinions rather than risk angering someone in a position of power. On the other hand, when people feel comfortable speaking up and meaning does flow freely, the shared pool can dramatically increase a group’s ability</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 25
to make better decisions. Consider what happened to Kevin’s group. As everyone on the team began to explain his or her opinion, people formed a clearer and more complete picture of the circumstances.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 25
As a result of the free flow of meaning, the whole (final choice) was truly greater than the sum of…

What starts as a doomed discussion ends up with a healthy resolution. It can take your breath away.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 28
Finally, we combined our philosophies, theories, models, and skills into a package of learnable tools—tools for talking when stakes are high. We then taught these skills and watched as key performance indicators and relationships improved.</p>

On a beautiful sunset balcony in Houston, my dad and I spent three tense hours dealing with a lot of pain and built-up resentment. I kept in mind what I had been taught and, rather than compromising candor, tried my best to create the conditions where we could be both honest and respectful. It was incredibly difficult. Sometimes the honesty threatened to put us right back in the angry state that got us there. But I kept focusing on what I really wanted—a relationship with my family.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 30
This is what most people have in mind when they think of crucial conversations. How do I express delicate feedback? How do I speak persuasively, not abrasively? And how about listening? Or better still, what can we do to get people to talk when they seem nervous? And how do we move from thought to action? As you read on, you will learn the key skills of talking, listening, and acting</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 35
Our problem is not that our behavior degenerates. It’s that our motives do—a fact that we usually miss.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 36
Skilled people Start with Heart. That is, they begin high-risk discussions with the right motives, and they stay focused no matter what happens.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 38
Winning. This particular dialogue killer sits at the top of many of our lists.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 39
Punishing. Sometimes, as our anger increases, we move from wanting to win the point to wanting to harm the other person.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 39
We move so far away from adding meaning to the pool that now all we want is to see others suffer.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 39
Keeping the peace. Of course, we don’t always fix mistakes, aggressively discredit others, or heartlessly try to make them suffer.</p>

We were wondering what had happened to Greta? How, we puzzled, did she remain so composed while under fire? Specifically, how did she move so quickly from wanting to get even with or possibly even humiliate the questioner to sincerely soliciting feedback?</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 41
What had helped her move from embarrassment and anger to gratitude?</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 41
“At first I did feel attacked, and I wanted to strike back. To be honest, I wanted to put that guy in his place. He was accusing me in public, and he was wrong.”</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 41
“And then it struck me,” she continued. “Despite the fact that I had 400 eyeballs pinned to me, a rather important question hit me like a ton of bricks: ‘What do I really want here?’”</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 41
Asking this question had a powerful effect on Greta’s thinking. As she focused on this far more important question, she quickly realized that her goal was to encourage these 200 managers to embrace the cost-reduction efforts—and to thereby influence thousands of others to do the same.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 41
As Greta contemplated this goal, she realized that the biggest barrier she faced was the widespread belief that she was a hypocrite.</p>
<p>Orange highlight | Page: 42
Interestingly, by transforming her motives Greta simultaneously transformed the way she saw the man who asked the question. Whereas seconds earlier he looked like an enemy, when her motives changed, the fellow now looked like an ally. In fact, this man had just handed her the best chance she could get to influence the audience by letting her publicly address a primary source of resistance to the cost-cutting effort. And so Greta moved to dialogue.</p>

intervention—the simple act of asking a potent question—can have a powerful effect on redirecting our hearts.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 42
Refocus your brain. Now, let’s move to a situation you might face. You’re speaking with someone who completely disagrees with you on a hot issue. How does all of this goal stuff apply? As you begin the discussion, start by examining your motives. Going in, ask yourself what you really want. Also, as the conversation unfolds and you find yourself starting to, say, defer to the boss or give your spouse the cold shoulder, pay attention to what’s happening to your objectives. Are you starting to change your goal to save face, avoid embarrassment, win, be right, or punish others? Here’s the…

In order to move back to motives that allow for dialogue, you must step away from the interaction and look at yourself—much like an outsider. Ask yourself: “What am I doing, and if I had to guess, what does it tell me about my underlying motive?” As you make an honest effort to discover your motive, you might conclude: “Let’s see. I’m pushing hard, making the argument stronger than I actually believe, and…

colleagues—under the influence of adrenaline we start to see our options as unnecessarily limited. We assume we have to choose between getting results and keeping a relationship. In our dumbed-down condition, we don’t even consider the option of achieving both.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 45
That’s why those who are skilled at crucial conversations present their brain with a more complex question. They routinely ask: “What do I want for myself, the other person, and the relationship?”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 45
When our brain isn’t functioning well, we resist complexity. We adore the ease of simply choosing between attacking</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 45
or hiding—and the fact that we think it makes us look good. “I’m sorry, but I just had to destroy the guy’s self-image if I was going to keep my integrity. It wasn’t pretty, but it was the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 45
that. You’ll find there is a way to share your concerns, listen sincerely to those of others, and build the relationship—all at the same time. And the results can be life changing.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 46
First, clarify what you really want. You’ve got a head start if you’ve already Started with Heart. If you know what you want for yourself, for others, and for the relationship, then you’re in position to break out of the Fool’s Choice. “What I want is for my husband to be more reliable. I’m tired of being let down by him when he makes commitments that I depend on.” Second, clarify what you really don’t want. This is the key to framing the and question. Think of what you are afraid will happen to you if you back away from your current strategy of trying to win or stay safe. What bad thing will happen if you stop pushing so hard? Or if you don’t try to escape? What horrible outcome makes game playing an attractive and sensible option? “What I don’t want is to have a useless and heated conversation that creates bad feelings and doesn’t lead to change.” Third, present your brain with a more complex problem.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 47
There is a third set of options out there that allows you to add meaning to the pool and build on the relationship.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 48
At first, we thought that maybe there were places where dialogue couldn’t survive. But then we learned to ask: “Are you saying there isn’t anyone you know who is able to hold a high-risk conversation in a way that solves problems and builds relationships?” There usually is.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 48
Work on Me First, Us Second • Remember that the only person you can directly control is yourself.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 48
Focus on What You Really Want</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 48
When you find yourself moving toward silence or violence, stop and pay attention to your motives.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 48
Ask yourself: “What does my behavior tell me about what my motives are?” • Then, clarify what you really want. Ask yourself: “What do I want for myself?</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 48
For others? For the relationship?” • And finally, ask: “How would I behave if this were what I really wanted?”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 48
As you consider what you want, notice when you start talking yourself into a Fool’s Choice. • Watch to see if you’re telling yourself that you must choose between peace and honesty, between winning and losing, and so on. • Break free of these Fool’s Choices by searching for the and. • Clarify what you don’t want, add it to what you do want, and ask your brain to start searching for healthy options to bring you to dialogue.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 52
“Yeah,” your coworker explains, “I always watch two elements. When things start turning ugly, I watch the content of the conversation (the topic under discussion) along with the conditions (what people are doing in response). I look for and examine both what and why. If you can see why people are becoming upset or holding back their views or even going silent, you can do something to get back on track.”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 53
In truth, most of us do have trouble dual-processing (simultaneously watching for content and conditions)—especially when both stakes and emotions are high.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 54
Actually, it helps to watch for three different conditions: the moment a conversation turns crucial, signs that people don’t feel safe (silence or violence), and your own Style Under Stress. Let’s consider each of these conversation killers in turn.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 54
To help catch problems early, reprogram your mind to</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 54
pay attention to the signs that suggest you’re in a crucial conversation. Some people first notice physical signals—their stomach gets tight or their eyes get dry. Think about what happens to your body when conversations get tough. Everyone is a little bit different. What are your cues? Whatever they are, learn to look at them as signs to step back, slow down, and Start with Heart before things get out of hand.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 55
People who are</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 55
gifted at dialogue keep a constant vigil on safety. They pay</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 55
When it’s safe, you can say anything. Here’s why gifted communicators keep a close eye on safety. Dialogue calls for the free flow of meaning—period. And nothing kills the flow of meaning like fear.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 55
This is a pretty remarkable claim. Think about it. We’re suggesting that people rarely become defensive simply because of what you’re saying. They only become defensive when they no longer feel safe. The problem is not the content of your message, but the condition of the conversation.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 56
On the other hand, if you don’t feel safe, you can’t take any feedback.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 56
It’s as if the pool of meaning has a lid on it. “What do you mean I look good? Is that some kind of joke? Are you insulting me?” When you don’t feel safe, even well-intended comments are suspect.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 56
When it’s unsafe, you start to go blind.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 57
As we’ve said before, when your emotions start cranking up, key brain functions start shutting down. Not only do you prepare to take flight, but your peripheral vision actually narrows. In fact, when you feel genuinely threatened, you can scarcely see beyond what’s right in front of you.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 57
By pulling yourself out of the content of an argument and looking for signs that safety is a risk, you reengage your brain and your full vision returns.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 57
As we suggested earlier, when you give your brain a new problem to consider (keep alert for signs that safety is at risk!), it affects your brain functioning. Your higher reasoning centers stay more active, and you’re far less likely to be dumbed down and far more likely to succeed in your crucial conversation.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 57
Don’t let safety problems lead you astray.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 57
Imagine the magnitude of what we’re suggesting here. We’re asking you to recode silence and violence as signs that people are feeling unsafe.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 57
We’re asking you to fight your natural tendency to respond in kind.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 57
We’re asking you to undo years of practice, maybe even eons of genetic shaping that prod you to take flight or pick a fight (when under attack), and recode the stimulus. “Ah, that’s a sign that the other person feels unsafe.” And then what? Do something to make it safe.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 58
Imagine increased influence, enhanced relationships, stronger teams, and more effective leadership. Turn on your capacity to recognize and respond to safety problems.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 58
In the next chapter we’ll explore how. For now, simply learn to look for safety, and then be curious, not angry or frightened.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 58
As people begin to feel unsafe, they start down one of two unhealthy paths. They move either to silence (withholding meaning from the pool) or to violence (trying to force</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 58
The three most common forms of silence are masking, avoiding, and withdrawing.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 60
The three most common forms are controlling, labeling, and attacking.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 62
Actually, no. Perhaps the most difficult element to watch closely as you’re madly dual-processing is your own behavior. Frankly,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 62
Unfortunately, when you fail to monitor your own behavior, you can look pretty silly.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 75
The good realize that safety is at risk, but they fix it in exactly the wrong way.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 75
They try to make the subject more palatable by sugarcoating their message.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 75
The best don’t play games. Period.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 76
So they do something completely different. They step out of the content of the conversation, make it safe, and then step back in. Once safety is restored, they can talk about nearly anything.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 76
For example, Yvonne gets back on the path of dialogue by saying: “Can we change gears for a minute? I’d like to talk about what happens when we’re not romantically in sync. It would be good if we could both share what’s working and what isn’t. My goal isn’t to make you feel guilty, and I certainly don’t want to become defensive. What I’d really love is for us to come up with a solution that makes us both satisfied in our relationship.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 76
but because they believe the content (even if it’s delivered in a gentle way) suggests that you have a malicious intent.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 77
How can others feel safe when they believe you’re out to harm them? Soon, every word out of your mouth is suspect. You can’t utter a harmless “good morning” without others interpreting it in a negative way.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Mutual Purpose is the entry condition of dialogue. Find a shared goal, and you have both a good reason and a healthy climate for talking.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Watch for signs that Mutual Purpose is at risk. How do we</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Do others believe I care about their goals in this conversation? • Do they trust my motives?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Remember the Mutual in Mutual Purpose. Just a word to the wise.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 78
What do I want for me? • What do I want for others? • What do I want for the relationship?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 78
Look for the mutuality.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 78
Let’s say you’ve got a boss who frequently fails to keep commitments. How could you tell the boss you don’t trust him? Surely there’s no way to say this without the boss becoming defensive or vengeful, because he knows that your goal is merely to make your life better. To avoid disaster, find a Mutual Purpose that would be so motivating to the boss that he’d want to hear your concerns. If your only reason for approaching the boss is to get</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 78
what you want, the boss will hear you as critical and selfish—</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 78
which is what you are.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 78
Imagine raising the topic this way: “I’ve got some ideas for how I can be much more reliable and even reduce costs by a few thousand dollars in preparing the report each month. It’s going to be a bit of a sensitive conversation—but I think it will help a great deal if we can talk about it.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 79
While it’s true that there’s no reason to enter a crucial conversation if you don’t have Mutual Purpose, it’s equally true that you can’t stay in the conversation if you don’t maintain Mutual Respect. Mutual Respect is the continuance condition of dialogue. As people perceive that others don’t respect them, the conversation immediately becomes unsafe and dialogue comes to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 79
Why? Because respect is like air. As long as it’s present, nobody thinks about it. But if you take it away, it’s all that people can think about. The instant people perceive disrespect in a conversation, the interaction is no longer about the original purpose—it is now about defending dignity.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 79
Telltale signs. To spot when respect is violated and safety takes a turn south, watch for signs that people are defending their dignity.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 79
Emotions</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 79
When people feel disrespected, they become highly charged. Their emotions turn from fear to anger. Then they resort to pouting, name-calling, yelling, and making threats. Ask the following question to determine when Mutual Respect is at risk:</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 80
Do others believe I respect them?</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 80
How, they wonder, can they share the same purpose with people who come from completely different backgrounds or whose morals or values differ from theirs? What do you do, for example, if you’re upset because another person has let you down? And if this has repeatedly happened, how can you respect a person who is so poorly motivated and selfish?</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 80
Dialogue truly would be doomed if we had to share every objective or respect every element of another person’s character before we could talk.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 80
However, we can stay in dialogue by finding a way to honor and regard another person’s basic humanity.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 80
In essence, feelings of disrespect often come when we dwell on how others are different from ourselves.</p>
<p>Note:Difference - disrespect</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 80
We can counteract these feelings by looking for ways we are similar. Without excusing others’ behavior, we try to sympathize, even empathize, with them.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 80
prayer—“Lord, help me forgive those who sin differently than I.”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 80
When we do this, we feel a kinship or mutuality between ourselves and even the thorniest of people.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 80
This sense of kinship and connection to others helps create Mutual Respect and eventually enables us to stay in dialogue with virtually anyone.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 81
Each group was to go into a separate room and write out its goals for the company on flip-chart-sized paper.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 81
After a few minutes the two groups returned to the training room. They were positively stunned. It was as if they had written the exact same lists. They didn’t merely share the shadow of an idea or two. Their aspirations were nearly identical. All wanted a profitable company, stable and rewarding jobs, high-quality products, and a positive impact on the community. Given a chance to speak freely and without fear of attack, each group laid out not simply what it wanted, but what virtually every person wanted.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 82
Apologize • Contrast • Create a Mutual Purpose</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 83
But you fail to restore safety. Why? Because now you feel disrespected. They’ve attacked you. So you stay stuck in the content of the conversation—thinking this has something to do with the factory tour.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 83
See their aggressive behavior for what it is—a sign of violated safety—</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 84
When you’ve made a mistake that has hurt others (e.g., you didn’t call the team), start with an apology. An apology is a statement that sincerely expresses your sorrow for your role in causing—or at least not preventing—pain or difficulty to others.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 84
Now, an apology isn’t really an apology unless you experience a change in heart. To offer a sincere apology, your motives have to change. You have to give up saving face, being right, or winning in order to focus on what you really want. You have to sacrifice a bit of your ego by admitting your error. But like many sacrifices, when you give up something you value, you’re rewarded with something even more valuable—healthy dialogue and better results.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 84
Sometimes others feel disrespected during crucial conversations even though you haven’t done anything disrespectful.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 84
But just as often, the insult is entirely unintended.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 85
When others misinterpret either your purpose or your intent, step out of the argument and rebuild safety by using a skill called Contrasting.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 85
Contrasting is a don’t/do statement that:</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 85
Addresses others’ concerns that you don’t respect them or that you have a malicious purpose (the don’t part). • Confirms your respect or clarifies your real purpose (the do part).</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 85
[The don’t part] “The last thing I wanted to do was communicate that I don’t value the work you put in or that I didn’t want to share it with the VP. [The do part] I think your work has been nothing short of spectacular.”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 86
Of the two parts of Contrasting, the don’t is the more important because it deals with the misunderstanding that has put safety at risk.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 87
Contrasting provides context and proportion.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 87
you talk with your assistant about his lack</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 88
At this point, you could be tempted to water down your content—“You know it’s really not that big a deal.” Don’t give into the temptation. Don’t take back what you’ve said. Instead, put your remarks in context.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 88
“Let me put this in perspective. I don’t want you to think I’m not satisfied with the quality of your work. I want us to continue working together. I really do think you’re doing a good job. This punctuality issue is important to me, and I’d just like you to work on that. If you will be more attentive to that, there are no other issues.”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 88
Use Contrasting for prevention or first aid. Contrasting can be useful both as prevention and as first aid for safety problems.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 88
So far our examples have helped us apply first</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 88
aid to a wounded conversation. Someone has taken something wrong, and we’ve intervened to clarify our true purpose or meaning. When we’re aware that something we’re about to drop into the pool of meaning</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 88
When people misunderstand and you start arguing over the misunderstanding, stop. Use Contrasting. Explain what you don’t mean until you’ve restored safety. Then return to the conversation. Safety first.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 91
The worst at dialogue either ignore the problem and push ahead or roll over and let others have their way. They opt for either competition or submission. Both strategies end up making winners and losers, and the problem continues long beyond the initial conversation.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 91
The good at dialogue move immediately toward compromise. For example, the couple facing the transfer sets up two house-holds—one where the transferred spouse will be working and one where the family currently lives. Nobody really wants this arrangement, and frankly, it’s a pretty ugly solution that’s bound to lead to more serious problems, even divorce. While compromise is sometimes necessary,</p>

The best at dialogue use four skills to create a Mutual Purpose. If it helps you remember what to do, note that the four skills used in creating Mutual Purpose form the acronym CRIB.</p>

You make you mad. You make you scared, annoyed, or insulted. You and only you create your emotions.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 104
Claim two. Once you’ve created your upset emotions, you have only two options: You can act on them or be acted on by them. That is, when it comes to strong emotions, you either find a way to master them or fall hostage to them. Here’s how this all unfolds.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 106
The best at dialogue do something completely different. They aren’t held hostage by their emotions, nor do they try to hide or suppress them. Instead, they act on their emotions. That is, when they have strong</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 107
feelings, they influence (and often change) their emotions by thinking them out. As a result, they choose their emotions, and by so doing, make it possible to choose behaviors that create better results.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 107
holding her feelings inside (avoiding) and taking cheap shots (masking).</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 108
As it turns out, there is an intermediate step between what others do and how we feel.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 108
There’s always an intermediate step because actions themselves can’t and don’t cause emotional reactions. That’s why, when faced with the exact same circumstances, ten people may have ten different emotional responses. For instance, with a coworker like Louis, some might feel insulted whereas others merely feel curious. Some become angry and others feel concern or even sympathy.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 108
What is this intermediate step? Just after we observe what others do and just before we feel some emotion about it, we tell ourselves a story.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 108
We add meaning to the action we observed. We make a guess at the motive driving the behavior.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 108
Why were they doing that? We also add judgment—is that good or bad? And then, based on these thoughts or stories, our body responds with</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 108
an emotion.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 109
Stories provide our rationale for</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 109
what’s going on. They’re our interpretations of the facts. They help explain what we see and hear. They’re theories we use to explain why, how, and what. For instance, Maria asks: “Why does Louis take over? He doesn’t trust my ability to communicate. He thinks that because I’m a woman, people won’t listen to me.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 111
If we take control of our stories, they won’t control us. People who excel at dialogue are able to influence their emotions during crucial conversations. They recognize that while it’s true that at first we are in control of the stories we tell—after all, we do make them up of our own accord—once they’re told, the stories control us.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 111
But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can tell different stories and break the loop. In fact, until we tell different stories, we cannot break the loop.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 113
Not only do those who are best at crucial conversations notice when they’re slipping into silence or violence, but they’re also able to admit it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 113
The moment they realize that they’re killing dialogue, they review their own Path to Action.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 113
Actually, identifying your emotions is more difficult than you might imagine. In fact, many people are emotionally illiterate. When asked to describe how they’re feeling, they use words such as “bad”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 113
or “angry” or “frightened”—which would be okay if these were accurate descriptors, but often they’re not.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 113
Individuals say they’re angry when, in fact, they’re feeling a mix of embarrassment and surprise. Or they suggest they’re unhappy when they’re feeling violated. Perhaps they suggest they’re upset when</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 114
they’re really feeling humiliated and cheated.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 114
Since life doesn’t consist of a series of vocabulary tests, you might wonder what difference words can make. But words do matter. Knowing what you’re really feeling helps you take a more accurate look at what is going on and why. For instance, you’re far</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 114
more likely to take an honest look at the story you’re telling yourself if you admit you’re feeling both embarrassed and surprised rather than simply angry.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 114
Meaning, of course, are you telling the right story? After all, feelings come from stories, and stories are our own invention.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 114
The first step to regaining emotional control is to challenge the illusion that what you’re feeling is the only right emotion under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 114
This may be the hardest step, but it’s also the most important one.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 114
By questioning our feelings, we open ourselves up to question our stories. We challenge the comfortable conclusion that our story is right and true. We willingly question whether our emotions (very real), and the story behind them (only one of many possible explanations), are accurate.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 115
As we said earlier, others could watch Maria’s interactions with Louis and walk away with different stories.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 115
Test your ideas against a simple criterion: Can you see or hear this thing you’re calling a fact? Was it an actual behavior?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 115
However, the statement “He doesn’t trust me” is a conclusion. It explains what you think, not what the other person did. Conclusions are subjective.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 116
Either our stories are completely accurate and propel us in healthy directions, or they’re quite inaccurate but justify our current behavior</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 116
us feel good about ourselves and calling for no need to change.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 116
We call these imaginative and self-serving concoctions “clever stories.” They’re clever because they allow us to feel good about behaving badly. Better yet, they allow us to feel good about behaving badly even while achieving abysmal results. When we feel a need to justify</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 116
we tend to tell our stories in three very predictable ways. Learn what the three are and how to counteract them, and you can take control of your emotional</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
In Victim Stories we exaggerate our own innocence. In Villain Stories we overemphasize the other person’s guilt or stupidity.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
We automatically assume the worst possible motives or grossest incompetence while ignoring any possible good or neutral</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
intentions or skills a person may have.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
Labeling is a common device in Villain Stories. For example, “I can’t believe that bonehead gave me bad materials again.” By employing the handy label, we are now dealing not with a complex human being, but with a bonehead.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
After all, we can feel okay insulting or abusing a bonehead—whereas we might have to be more careful with a living, breathing person.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
Then when we fail to get the results we really want, we stay stuck in our ineffective behavior because, after all, look who we’re dealing with!</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 119
Finally come Helpless Stories. In</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 119
these fabrications we make ourselves out to be powerless to do anything healthy or helpful.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 119
We convince ourselves that there are no healthy alternatives for dealing with our predicament, which justifies the action we’re about to take.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 119
Villain and Victim Stories look back to explain why we’re in the situation we’re in, Helpless Stories look forward to explain why we can’t do anything to change our situation.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 119
helpless when we turn others’ behavior into fixed and unchangeable traits. For example, when we decide our colleague is a “control freak” (Villain Story), we are less inclined to give her feedback because, after all, control freaks like her don’t accept feedback (Helpless Story). Nothing we can do will change that fact.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 119
As you can see, Helpless Stories often stem from Villain Stories and typically offer us nothing more than Fool’s Choices— we can either be honest and ruin the relationship or stay silent and suffer.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 119
Clever stories match reality.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 120
Clever stories get us off the hook.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 121
Your spouse’s annoying habit didn’t become a source of resentment until you became part of the problem.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
Once we’ve learned to recognize the clever stories we tell ourselves, we can move to the final Master My Stories skill. The dialogue-smart</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
recognize that they’re telling clever stories, stop, and then do what it takes to tell a useful story. A useful story, by definition, creates emotions that lead to healthy action—such as dialogue.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 123
• Am I pretending not to notice my role in the problem? This question jars you into facing up to the fact that maybe, just maybe, you did something to help cause the problem.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 123
Perhaps your contribution was merely a thoughtless omission. Nonetheless, you contributed.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 124
Turn villains into humans. When you find yourself labeling or otherwise vilifying others, stop and ask:</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 124
• Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do what this person is doing? This particular question humanizes others. As we search for plausible answers to it, our emotions soften. Empathy often replaces judgment, and depending upon how we’ve treated others, personal accountability replaces self-justification.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 124

<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 124
As we search for plausible answers to it, our emotions soften. Empathy often replaces judgment, and depending upon how we’ve treated others, personal accountability replaces self-justification.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 124
But what if she really were a reasonable, rational, and decent person? What if she had no motive other than to give you a hand? Isn’t it a bit early to be vilifying her? And if you do, don’t you run the risk of ruining a relationship?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 124
The purpose of the humanizing question is to deal with our own stories and emotions. It provides us with still another tool for working on ourselves first by providing a variety of possible reasons for the other person’s behavior.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 124
In fact, with experience and maturity we learn to worry less about others’ intent and more about the effect others’ actions are having on us.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 124
And here’s the good news. When we reflect on alternative motives, not only do we soften our emotions, but equally important, we relax our absolute certainty long enough to allow for dialogue— the only reliable way of discovering others’ genuine motives.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 125
Turn the helpless into the able. Finally, when you catch yourself bemoaning your own helplessness, you can tell the complete story by returning to your original motive. To do so, stop and ask:</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 125
What do I really want? For me? For others? For the relationship? Then, kill the Fool’s Choice that’s made you feel helpless to choose anything other than silence or violence. Do this by asking:</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 125
• What would I do right now if I really wanted these results?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 125
What would I do right now if I really wanted these results?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 125
When you refuse to make yourself helpless, you’re forced to hold yourself accountable for using your dialogue skills rather than bemoaning your weakness.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 126
As we tell the rest of the story, we free ourselves from the poisoning effects of unhealthy emotions. Best of all, as we regain control and move back to dialogue, we become masters of our own emotions rather than hostages.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 128
As soon as she shows signs of frustration, I stop and remind her that I am on her side.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 131
So far we’ve gone to great pains to prepare ourselves to step up to and master crucial conversations. Here’s what we’ve learned. Our hearts need to be in the right place. We need to pay close attention to crucial conversations—particularly when people start feeling unsafe—and restore safety when necessary. And heaven forbid that we should tell ourselves clever and unhelpful stories.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 131
Most of the time, we walk into a discussion and slide into autopilot. “Hi, how are the kids? What’s going on at work?” What could be easier than talking? We know thousands of words and generally weave them into sentences that suit our needs. Most of the time.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 132
However, when stakes rise and our emotions kick in, well, that’s when we open our mouths and don’t do so well.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 132
In fact, as we suggested earlier, the more important the discussion, the less likely we are to be on our best behavior. More specifically, we advocate or express our views quite poorly.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 132
“I’m sorry, Marta, but people simply don’t like working with you. You’ve been asked to leave the special-projects team.” It’s one thing to argue that your company needs to shift from green to red packaging; it’s quite another to tell a person that he or she is offensive or unlikable. When the topic turns from things to people, it’s always more difficult, and to nobody’s surprise, some people are better at it than others.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 133
The best at dialogue speak their minds completely and do it in a way that makes it safe for others to hear what they have to say and respond to it as well.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 133
They are both totally frank and completely respectful.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 133
if you know how to carefully blend three ingredients—confidence, humility, and skill.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 133
People who are skilled at dialogue have the confidence to say what needs to be said to the person who needs to hear it. They are confident that their opinions deserve to be placed in the pool of meaning. They are also confident that they can speak openly without brutalizing others or causing undue offense.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 133
Skilled people are confident that they have something to say, but also realize that others have valuable input. They are humble enough to realize that they don’t have a monopoly on the truth nor do they always have to win their way.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 134
This means they’re willing to both express their opinions and encourage others to do the same. Skill. Finally, people who willingly share delicate information are good at doing it. That’s why they’re confident in the first place. They don’t make a Fool’s Choice, because they’ve found a path that allows for both candor and safety. They speak the unspeakable, and people are grateful for their honesty.</p>

moving back to Australia)? What’s the worst way of talking about the problem? Most people agree that jumping in with an ugly accusation followed by a threat is a good candidate for that distinction. It’s also what most people do, and Carole is no exception.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 136
Share your facts • Tell your story • Ask for others’ paths • Talk tentatively • Encourage testing</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 137
Of course, starting with our ugly stories is the most controversial, least influential, and most insulting way we could begin.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 138
it. We hold it inside where the story builds up steam, and when we do eventually share our horrific story, we do so with a vengeance. The cycle starts all over again.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 138
Facts are the least controversial. Facts provide a safe beginning. By their very nature, facts aren’t controversial. That’s why we call them facts. For example, consider the statement: “Yesterday you arrived at work twenty minutes late.” No dispute there. Conclusions, on the other hand, are highly controversial. For example: “You can’t be trusted.” That’s hardly a fact. Actually, it’s more like an insult, and</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 138
Facts are the most persuasive. In addition to being less controversial, facts are also more persuasive than subjective conclusions. Facts form the foundation of belief. So if you want to persuade others, don’t start with your stories. Start with your observations. For example, which of the following do you find more persuasive?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 138
“I want you to stop sexually harassing me!” or   “When you talk to me, your eyes move up and down rather than look at my face. And sometimes you put your hand on my shoulder.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 139
When we start with shocking or offensive conclusions (“Quit groping me with your eyes!” or “I think we should declare bankruptcy”), we actually encourage others to tell Villain Stories about us. Since we’ve given them no facts to</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 139
support our conclusion, they make up reasons we’re saying these things. They’re likely to believe we’re either stupid or evil.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 139
And if you aren’t sure what your facts are (your story is absolutely filling your brain), take the time to think them through before you enter the crucial conversation. Take the time to sort out facts from conclusions. Gathering the facts is the homework required for crucial conversations. Facts are the least insulting. If you do want to share your story, don’t start with it. Your story (particularly if it has led to a rather ugly conclusion) could easily surprise and insult others. It could kill safety in one rash, ill-conceived sentence.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 140
Begin your path with facts. In order to talk about your stories, you need to lead the others involved down your Path to Action. Let them experience your path from the beginning to the end, and not from the end to—well, to wherever</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 140
Earn the right to share your story by starting with your facts. Facts lay the groundwork for all delicate conversations.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 140
Sharing your story can be tricky. Even if you’ve started with your facts, the other person can still become defensive when you move from facts to stories. After all, you’re sharing potentially unflattering conclusions and judgments.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 141
(Sounds like it’s time for a conclusion.) “I was wondering what the software is doing in your briefcase. It looks like you’re taking it home. Is that what’s going on here?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 141
It takes confidence. To be honest, it can be difficult to share negative conclusions and unattractive judgments (e.g., “I’m wondering if you’re a thief”). It takes confidence to share such a potentially inflammatory story. However, if you’ve done your homework by thinking through the facts behind your story, you’ll realize that you are drawing</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 141
By thinking through the facts and then leading with them, you’re much more likely to have the confidence you need to add controversial and vitally important meaning to the shared pool.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 142
Look for safety problems. As you share your story, watch for signs that safety is deteriorating. If people start becoming defensive or appear to be insulted, step out of the conversation and rebuild safety by Contrasting.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 143
Be careful not to apologize for your views. Remember, the goal of Contrasting is not to water down your message, but to be sure that people don’t hear more than you intend. Be confident enough to share what you really want to</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 144
One of the ironies of dialogue is that, when talking with those holding opposing opinions, the more convinced and forceful you act, the more resistant others become. Speaking in absolute and overstated terms does not increase your influence, it decreases it. The converse is also true—the more tentatively you speak, the more open people become to your opinions.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 145
“It’s starting to look like you’re</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 145
“It’s leading me to conclude that you’re</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 145
starting to use drugs. Do you have another explanation that I’m missing</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 146
right: “I’m starting to feel like you don’t trust me. Is that what’s going on here? If so, I’d like to know what I did to lose your trust.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 146
Just right: “I don’t think you’re intending this, but I’m beginning to feel rejected.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 146
Safety becomes particularly important when you’re having a crucial conversation with people who might move to silence. Some people make Fool’s Choices in these circumstances. They worry that if they share their true opinions, others will clam up. So they choose between speaking their minds and hearing others out. But the best at dialogue don’t choose. They do both. They understand that the only limit to how strongly you can express your opinion is your willingness to be equally vigorous in encouraging others to challenge</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 146
Invite opposing views. So if you think others may be hesitant, make it clear that you want to hear their views—no matter how different. If others disagree, so much the better.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 147
“Does anyone see it differently?” “What am I missing here?” “I’d</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 147
really like to hear the other side of this story.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 147
Mean it. Sometimes people offer an invitation that sounds more like a threat than a legitimate call for opinions. “Well, that’s how I see it. Nobody disagrees, do they?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 147
Play devil’s advocate. Occasionally you can tell that others are not buying into your facts or story, but they’re not speaking up either. You’ve sincerely invited them, even encouraged differing views, but nobody says anything. To help grease the skids, play devil’s advocate. Model disagreeing by disagreeing with your own view. “Maybe I’m wrong here. What if the opposite is true? What if the reason sales have dropped is because</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 148
It’s just that it might help put my mind to rest if we were to check on this right now.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 150
It starts with a story. When we feel the need to push our ideas on others, it’s generally because we believe we’re right and everyone else is wrong. There’s no need to expand the pool of meaning, because we own the pool. We also firmly believe it’s our duty to fight for the truth that we’re holding. It’s the honorable thing to do. It’s what people of character do.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 151
We use debating tricks that we’ve picked up throughout the years. Chief among them is the ability to “stack the deck.” We cite information that supports our ideas while hiding or discrediting anything that doesn’t.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 151
Then we spice things up with exaggeration: “Everyone knows that this is the only way to go.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 151
When this doesn’t work, we lace our language with inflammatory terms: “All right-thinking people would agree with me.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 151
We appeal to authority: “Well, that’s what the boss thinks.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 151
We draw hasty generalizations:</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 151
And again, the harder we try and the more forceful and nasty our tactics, the greater the resistance we create, the worse the results, and the more battered our relationships.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 151
When you find yourself just dying to convince others that your way is best, back off your current attack and think about what you really want for yourself, others, and the relationship. Then ask yourself, “How would I behave if these were the results I really wanted?” When your adrenaline level gets below the 0.05 legal limit, you’ll be able to use your STATE skills.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 152
First, Learn to Look. Watch for the moment when people start to resist you—perhaps they begin to raise their volume and/or overstate the facts behind their views in reaction to your tactics—or perhaps they retreat into silence. Turn your attention away from the topic (no matter how important) and onto yourself. Are you leaning forward? Are you speaking more loudly? Are you starting to try to win? Are you speaking in lengthy monologues and using dirty tricks? Remember: The more you care about an issue, the less likely you are to be on your best behavior.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 152
Of course, this isn’t easy. Backing off when we care the most is so counterintuitive that most of us have trouble doing so. It’s not easy to soften your language when you’re positive about something. And who wants to ask for other views when you know they’re wrong? That’s positively nuts.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 152
Let’s face it. When it comes to our strongest views, passion can be our enemy. Of course, feeling strongly about something isn’t bad in and of itself. It’s okay to have strong opinions. The problem comes when we try to express them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 153
Catch yourself. So what’s a person to do? Catch yourself before you launch into a monologue. Realize that if you’re starting to feel indignant or if you can’t figure out why others don’t buy in—after all, it’s so obvious to you—recognize that you’re starting to enter dangerous territory. Back off your harsh and conclusive language. But don’t back off your belief. Hold to your belief; merely soften your approach.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 157
when most people become furious, we need to become curious. Rather than respond in kind, we need to wonder what’s behind the ruckus.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 157
But how? How can we possibly act curious when others are either attacking us or heading for cover? People who routinely seek to find out why others are feeling unsafe do so because they have learned that getting at the source of fear and discomfort is the best way to return to dialogue.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 157
Either they’ve seen others do it or they’ve stumbled on the formula themselves. Either way, they realize that the cure to silence or violence isn’t to respond in kind, but to get at the underlying source. This calls for genuine curiosity—at a time when you’re likely to be feeling frustrated or angry.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 158
Stay curious. When people begin to share their volatile stories and feelings, we now face the risk of pulling out our own Victim, Villain, and Helpless Stories to help us explain why they’re saying what they’re saying. Unfortunately, since it’s rarely fun to hear other people’s unflattering stories, we begin to assign negative motives to them for telling the stories. For example:</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 159
To avoid overreacting to others’ stories, stay curious. Give your brain a problem to stay focused on. Ask: “Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person say this?” This question keeps you retracing the other person’s Path to Action until you see how it all fits together. And in most</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 159
Be patient. When others are acting out their feelings and opinions through silence or violence, it’s a good bet they’re starting to feel the effects of adrenaline. Even if we do our best to safely and effectively respond to the other person’s verbal attack, we still have to face up to the fact that it’s going to take a little while for him or her to settle down. Say, for example, that a friend dumps out an ugly story and you treat it with respect and continue on with the conversation. Even if the two of you now share a similar view, it may seem like your friend is still pushing too hard. While it’s natural to move quickly from one thought to the next, strong emotions take a while to subside. Once the chemicals that fuel emotions are released, they hang around in the bloodstream for a time—in some cases, long after thoughts have changed.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 159
So be patient when exploring how others think and feel. Encourage them to share their path and then wait for their emotions to catch up with the safety that you’ve created.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 159
Once you’ve decided to maintain a curious approach, it’s time to help the other person retrace his or her Path to Action. Unfortunately, most of us fail to do so. That’s because when others start playing silence or violence games, we’re joining the conversation at the end of their Path to Action. They’ve seen and heard things, told themselves a story or two, generated a feeling (possibly a mix of fear and anger or disappointment), and now they’re starting to act out their story. That’s where we come in. Now, even though we may be hearing their first words, we’re coming in somewhere near the end of their path. On the Path to</p>

When we’re on the receiving end of someone’s retributions, accusations, and cheap shots, rarely do we think: “My, what an interesting story he or she must have told.

As you watch families and work groups take part in heated debates, it’s common to notice a rather intriguing phenomenon. Although the various parties you’re observing are violently arguing, in truth, they’re in violent agreement. They actually agree on every important point, but they’re still fighting. They’ve found a way to turn subtle differences into a raging debate.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 171
Most arguments consist of battles over the 5 to 10 percent of the facts and stories that people disagree over. And while it’s true that people eventually need to work through differences, you shouldn’t start there. Start with an area of agreement.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 171
So here’s the take-away. If you completely agree with the other person’s path, say so and move on. Agree when you agree. Don’t turn an agreement into an argument.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 171
Of course, the reason most of us turn agreements into debates is because we disagree with a certain portion of what the other person has said. Never mind that it’s a minor portion. If it’s a point of disagreement, we’ll jump all over it like a fleeing criminal.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 171
it first is even better. And of course, having it first after others are wrong endows you with an even greater glory! Over time you find that finding even the tiniest of errors in others’ facts, thinking, or logic reinforces your supreme place in the spotlight of teacher and peer admiration. So you point out their errors. Being right at the expense of others becomes skillful sport.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 171
On the other hand, when you watch people who are skilled in dialogue, it becomes clear that they’re not playing this everyday game of Trivial Pursuit—looking for trivial differences and then proclaiming them aloud. In fact, they’re looking for points of agreement. As a result, they’ll often start with the words “I agree.” Then they talk about the part they agree with. At least, that’s where they start.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 172
Now when the other person has merely left out an element of the argument, skilled people will agree and then build. Rather than saying: “Wrong. You forgot to mention . . .,” they say: “Absolutely. In addition, I noticed that. .</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 172
If you agree with what has been said but the information is incomplete, build. Point out areas of agreement, and</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 172
then add elements that were left out of the discussion.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 172
Finally, if you do disagree, compare your path with the other person’s. That is, rather than suggesting that he or she is wrong, suggest that you differ. He or she may, in fact, be wrong, but you don’t know for sure until you hear both sides of the story. For now, you just know that the two of you differ. So instead of pronouncing “Wrong!” start with a tentative but candid opening, such as “I think I see things differently. Let me describe how.”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 172
In summary, to help remember these skills, think of your ABCs. Agree when you agree. Build when others leave out key pieces. Compare when you differ. Don’t turn differences into debates that lead to unhealthy relationships and bad results.</p>

They have unclear expectations about how decisions will be made.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 178
• They do a poor job of acting on the decisions they do make. This</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 179
Both of these problems are solved if, before making a decision, the people involved decide how to decide. Don’t allow people to assume that dialogue is decision making. Dialogue is a process for getting all relevant meaning into a shared pool. That process, of course, involves everyone. However, simply because everyone is allowed to share their meaning—actually encouraged to share their meaning—doesn’t mean they are then guaranteed to take part in making all the decisions. To avoid violated expectations, separate dialogue from decision making. Make it clear how decisions will be made—who will be involved and why.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 179
When the line of authority isn’t clear. When there is no clear line of authority, deciding how to decide can be quite difficult.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 180
Don’t mention lawyers or a lawsuit in your opening comments; this only reduces safety and sets up an adversarial climate.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 180
There are four common ways of making decisions: command, consult, vote, and consensus.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 181
Consulting is a process whereby decision makers invite others to influence them before they make their choice.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 182
Consensus This method can be both a great blessing and a frustrating curse. Consensus means you talk until everyone honestly agrees to one decision. This method can produce tremendous unity and high-quality decisions. If misapplied, it can also be a horrible waste of time. It should only be used with (1) high-stakes and complex issues or (2) issues where everyone absolutely must support the final choice.</p>

Be sure to spell out the exact deliverables you have in mind. The fuzzier the expectations, the higher the likelihood of disappointment.</p>

assignment, clarify up front the exact details of what you want. Couples get into trouble in this area when one of the parties doesn’t want to take the time to think carefully about the “deliverables” and then later on becomes upset because his or her unstated desires weren’t met. Have you ever remodeled a room with a loved one? Then you know what we’re talking about. Better to spend the time up front clarifying exactly what you want rather than waste resources and hurt feelings on the back end.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 186
It’s shocking how often people leave this element out of an assignment. Instead of giving a deadline, people simply point to the setting sun of “someday.” With vague or unspoken deadlines, other urgencies come up, and the assignment finds its way to the bottom of the pile, where it is soon forgotten. Assignments without deadlines are far better at producing guilt than stimulating action. Goals without deadlines aren’t goals; they’re merely directions.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 186
Remember, if you want people to feel accountable, you must give them an opportunity to account. Build an expectation for follow-up into every assignment.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 186
Once again, a proverb comes to mind. “One dull pencil is worth six sharp minds.”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 191
When you feel a measure of respect for the other person, you’re ready to begin. After establishing a Mutual Purpose for the exchange, STATE your path. For example:</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 191
“I’d like to talk about something that’s getting in the way of my working with you. It’s a tough issue to bring up, but I think it’ll help us be better teammates if I do. Is that okay?” [Establish Mutual Purpose]</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 192
This is generally a problem of not knowing how to STATE Your Path. When something bothers you, catch it early. Contrasting can also help. “I’m not trying to blow this out of proportion. I just want to deal with it before it gets out of hand.” Describe the specific behaviors you’ve observed.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 192
When spouses stop giving each other helpful feedback, they lose out on the help of a lifelong confidant and coach. They miss out on hundreds of opportunities to help each other communicate more effectively.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Page: 194
Despite this disclaimer, the way they carry themselves, their habit of speaking in absolutes, their subtle use of authority—something out there—is creating fear and eventual deference.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Page: 195
“It seems to me that you’re agreeing with me because I’m the boss and not because what I’m saying makes sense.”</p>

Fortunately for us, after analyzing their results, Mandel and Johnson were in a position to deliver a stunningly simple answer to the “Yeah, but how?” question. In an article largely overlooked since it was published in 2002, they described how they were able to draw website visitors’ attention to the goal of comfort merely by placing fluffy clouds on the background wallpaper of the site’s landing page. That maneuver led those visitors to assign elevated levels of importance to comfort when asked what they were looking for in a sofa. Those same visitors also became more likely to search the site for information about the comfort features of the sofas in stock and, most notably, to choose a more comfortable (and more costly) sofa as their preferred purchase. To make sure their results were due to the landing page wallpaper and not to some general human preference for comfort, Mandel and Johnson reversed their procedure for other visitors, who saw wallpaper that pulled their attention to the goal of economy by depicting pennies instead of clouds. These visitors assigned greater levels of importance to price, searched the site primarily for cost information, and preferred an inexpensive sofa.</p>

Made to Stick: Why some ideas take hold and others come unstuck

Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 20
The tapper/listener experiment is reenacted every day across the world.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 20
There are, in fact, only two ways to beat the Curse of Knowledge reliably. The first is not to learn anything. The second is to take your ideas and transform them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 22
They found that 89 percent of the award-winning ads could be classified into six basic categories, or templates. That’s remarkable.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 22
Most of these templates relate to the principle of unexpectedness.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 23
The surprising lesson of this story: Highly creative ads are more predictable than uncreative ones. It’s like Tolstoy’s quote: “All happy families resemble each other, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” All creative ads resemble one another, but each loser is uncreative in its own way.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 23
if creative ads consistently make use of the same basic set of templates, perhaps “creativity” can be taught. Perhaps even novices—with no creative experience—could produce better ideas if they understood the templates.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 23
experienced creativity instructor who showed the participants how to use a free-association brainstorming method.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 23
This technique is a standard method for teaching creativity; it’s supposed to broaden associations, spark unexpected connections,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 23
The final group was trained for two hours on how to use the six creative templates. Once again, the fifteen best ads were selected by the creative director and tested with consumers. Suddenly these novices sprouted creativity. Their ads were rated as 50 percent more creative and produced a 55 percent more positive attitude toward the products advertised. This is a stunning improvement for a two-hour investment in learning a few basic templates! It appears that there are indeed systematic ways to produce creative ideas.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 24
WHAT THIS ISRAELI research team did for advertisements is what this book does for your ideas.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 24
But isn’t the use of a template or a checklist confining? Surely we’re not arguing that a “color by numbers” approach will yield more creative work than a blank-canvas approach? Actually, yes, that’s exactly what we’re saying. If you want to spread your ideas to other people, you should work within the confines of the rules that have allowed other ideas to succeed over time. You want to invent new ideas, not new rules.</p>

The French aviator and author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry once offered a definition of engineering elegance: “A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.”</p>

News reporters are taught to start their stories with the most important information. The first sentence, called the lead,</p>

Forced prioritization is really painful. Smart people recognize the value of all the material. They see nuance, multiple perspectives—and because they fully appreciate the complexities of a situation, they’re often tempted to linger there.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 32
This tendency to gravitate toward complexity is perpetually at war with the need to prioritize.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 34
psychologists have found that people can be driven to irrational decisions by too much complexity and uncertainty.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 37
Prioritization rescues people from the quicksand of decision angst, and that’s why finding the core is so valuable.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 37
Core messages help people avoid bad choices by reminding them of what’s important.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 41
PUNCH LINE: Avoid burying the lead. Don’t start with something interesting but irrelevant in hopes of entertaining the audience. Instead, work to make the core message itself more interesting.</p>

Adams’s Commander’s Intent is clear: “Names, names, and names.” Adams can’t be everywhere. But by finding the core and communicating it clearly, he has made himself everywhere. That’s the power of a sticky idea.</p>

It’s a bandwidth issue: The more we reduce the amount of information in an idea, the stickier it will</p>

If remembering was like weight lifting, it would be ridiculous to think we could “lift” JFK easier than three little letters!</p>

We’ve already built those muscles—the concept of JFK, and all its associations, is already embedded in our memories. What we’re remembering is simply a pointer to this information—we’re posting a little flag on the terrain of our memory. With the raw letters, we’re posting three separate flags. In the end, it’s one bit of information (or one flag) versus three, and it’s no surprise that one is easier to remember.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 52
You use flags. You tap the existing memory terrain of your audience. You use what’s already there.</p>

Generative metaphors and proverbs both derive their power from a clever substitution: They substitute something easy to think about for something difficult.</p>

The first problem of communication is getting people’s attention.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 64
The most basic way to get someone’s attention is this: Break a pattern. Humans adapt incredibly quickly to consistent patterns.</p>

Our brain is designed to be keenly aware of changes.</p>

when products require users to pay attention, something changes.</p>

This chapter focuses on two essential questions: How do I get people’s attention? And, just as crucially, How do I keep it?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 65
To understand the answers to these two questions, we have to understand two essential emotions—surprise and interest—that are commonly provoked by naturally sticky ideas.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 67
Our schemas are like guessing machines. Schemas help us predict what will happen and, consequently, how we should make decisions.</p>

For instance, a secondary effect of being angry, which was recently discovered by researchers, is that we become more certain of our judgments. When we’re angry, we know we’re right, as anyone who has been in a relationship can attest.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 67
So if emotions have biological purposes, then what is the biological purpose of surprise? Surprise jolts us to attention. Surprise is triggered when our schemas fail, and it prepares us to understand why the failure occurred. When our guessing machines fail, surprise grabs our attention so that we can repair them for the future.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 68
a book called Unmasking the Face, Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen coined a term, “the surprise brow,” to</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 68
When our brows go up, it widens our eyes and gives us a broader field of vision—the surprise brow is our body’s way of forcing us to see more.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 68
Unexpected ideas are more likely to stick because surprise makes us pay attention and think.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 68
Surprise can prompt us to hunt for underlying causes, to imagine other possibilities, to figure out how to avoid surprises in the future.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 71
The emotion of surprise is designed to focus our attention on the failure, so that we can improve our guessing machines for the future. Then we drew a distinction between gimmicky surprise, like dot-com ads, and meaningful post-dictable surprise.</p>

Finally, he said, “The lead to the story is ‘There will be no school next Thursday.’”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 76
“In that instant I realized that journalism was not just about regurgitating the facts but about figuring out the point. It wasn’t enough to know the who, what, when, and where; you had to understand what it meant. And why it mattered.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 80
We began this chapter with two questions: How do we get people’s attention? And how do we keep it?</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 80
“I also found something I had not expected—the most successful of these pieces all began with a mystery story. The authors described a state of affairs that seemed to make no sense and then invited the reader into the material as a way of solving the mystery.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 81
Mysteries are powerful, Cialdini says, because they create a need for closure. “You’ve heard of the famous Aha! experience, right?” he says. “Well, the Aha! experience is much more satisfying when it is preceded by the Huh? experience.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 81
Cialdini began to create mysteries in his own classroom, and the power of the approach quickly became clear.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 81
“Normally five to ten minutes before the scheduled end time, some students start preparing to leave. You know the signals—pencils are put away, notebooks folded, backpacks zipped up.”</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 82
Cialdini believes that a major benefit of teaching using mysteries is that “the process of resolving mysteries is remarkably similar to the process of science.” So, by using mysteries, teachers don’t just heighten students’ interest in the day’s material; they train them to think like scientists.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 82
Mystery is created not from an unexpected moment but from an unexpected journey. We know where we’re headed—we want to solve the mystery—but we’re not sure how we’ll get there.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 83
McKee says, “Curiosity11 is the intellectual need to answer questions and close open patterns. Story plays to this universal desire by doing the opposite, posing questions and opening situations.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 83
In McKee’s view, a great script is designed so that every scene is a Turning Point. “Each Turning Point hooks curiosity. The audience wonders, What will happen next? and How will it turn out?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 83
McKee notes that the How will it turn out? question is powerful enough to keep us watching even when we know better. “Think of all the bad films you’ve sat through just to get the answer to that nagging question.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 84
In 1994, George Loewenstein,12 a behavioral economist at Carnegie Mellon University, provided the most comprehensive account of situational interest. It is surprisingly simple. Curiosity, he says, happens when we feel a gap in our knowledge.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 84
Loewenstein argues that gaps cause pain.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 85
“Story works by posing questions and opening situations.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 85
Pokémon cards cause kids to wonder, Which characters am I missing?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 85
One important implication of the gap theory is that we need to open gaps before we close them. Our tendency is to tell people the facts. First, though, they must realize that they need these facts. The trick to convincing people that they need our message, according to Loewenstein, is to first highlight some specific knowledge that they’re missing. We can pose a question or puzzle that confronts people with a gap in their knowledge.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 85
We can point out that someone else knows something they don’t. We can present them with situations that have unknown resolutions, such as elections, sports events, or mysteries. We can challenge them to predict an outcome (which creates two knowledge gaps—What will happen? and Was I right?).</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 85
They work because they tease you with something that you don’t know—in fact, something that you didn’t care about at all, until you found out that you didn’t know it. “Is my daughter strung out on one of my old prescriptions? I wonder if I ate at the restaurant with the slime?</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 86
In improving this message, we need to think about how to elicit interest rather than force-feeding facts.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 87
This approach is inspired by the gap theory. The goal is not to summarize; it’s to make you care about knowing something, and then to tell you what you want to know.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 87
The improvement here is driven by structure, not content. Let’s face it, this is not a particularly interesting mystery. It would never make an episode of Law &amp; Order. But our minds are extremely generous when it comes to mysteries—the format is inherently appealing.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 88
The news-teaser approach can be used with all sorts of ideas in all sorts of contexts. To make our communications more effective, we need to shift our thinking from “What information do I need to convey?” to “What questions do I want my audience to ask?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 88
know. One complication is that people tend to think they know a lot.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 88
If people believe they know everything, it’s hard to make the gap theory work. Fortunately, there are strategies for combating overconfidence. For instance, Nora Ephron’s journalism teacher prevented overconfidence by causing the students’ schemas of journalism to fail. He made them commit to their preconceived ideas and then pulled the rug out from under them.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 88
Making people commit to a prediction can help prevent overconfidence.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 89
Eric Mazur, a physics professor at Harvard, came up with a pedagogical innovation known as “concept testing.” Every so often in his classes, Mazur will pose a conceptual question and then ask his students to vote publicly on the answer. The simple act of committing to an answer makes the students more engaged and more curious about the outcome.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 89
The thirst to fill a knowledge gap—to find out who was right—can be more powerful than the thirst for slides and jungle gyms.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 89
If curiosity arises from knowledge gaps, we might assume that when we know more, we’ll become less curious because there are fewer gaps in our knowledge.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 89
But Loewenstein argues that the opposite is true. He says that as we gain</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 89
information we are more and more likely to focus on what we don’t know. Someone who knows the state capitals of 17 of 50 states may be proud of her knowledge. But someone who knows 47 may be more likely to think of herself as not knowing 3 capitals.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 90
Human-interest stories are fascinating because we know what it’s like to be human—but we don’t know what it’s like to have certain dramatic experiences.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 90
Gossip is popular because we know a lot about some people but there’s some information that we lack.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 91
The trick, Arledge said, was to give people enough context about the game so that they’d start to care.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 91
Arledge intuitively made use of Loewenstein’s gap theory. How do you get people interested in a topic? You point out a gap in their knowledge. But what if they lack so much knowledge about, say, the Georgia Bulldogs, that they’ve got more of an abyss than a gap? In that case, you have to fill in enough knowledge to make the abyss into a gap.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 92
The tool kit he developed for NCAA football stood the test of time. The way to get people to care is to provide context. Today that seems obvious, because these techniques have become ubiquitous. But this avalanche of context started because a twenty-nine-year-old wrote a memo about how to make college football more interesting.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 92
Knowledge gaps create interest. But to prove that the knowledge gaps exist, it may be necessary to highlight some knowledge first.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 93
“Here’s what you know. Now here’s what you’re missing.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 93
Alternatively, you can set context so people care what comes next.</p>

Unexpected ideas, by opening a knowledge gap, tease and flirt.</p>

In Kennedy’s address to Congress, he outlined a series of requests to help the United States maintain its leadership during the Cold War. He asked for funds to achieve a number of strategic goals: to establish the AID program for international development, to expand the NATO alliance, to build radio and television stations in Latin America and Southeast Asia, and to shore up civil defense.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 96
next, the ideas give us a sudden, dramatic glimpse of how the world might unfold. And not just how but why.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 96
it’s important to remember that knowledge gaps are painful. “If people like curiosity,15 why do they work to resolve it?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 97
When we’re skeptical about our ability to get people’s attention, or our ability to keep people’s attention, we should draw inspiration from Kennedy and Ibuka. And, on a smaller scale, from Nora Ephron’s journalism teacher and Nordstrom’s managers. Unexpectedness, in the service of core principles, can have surprising longevity.</p>

Clearly, Aesop was illustrating a universal human shortcoming. The fable would not have survived for more than 2,500 years if it didn’t reflect some profound truth about human nature.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 99
This truth is especially sticky because of the way it was encoded. The concrete images evoked by the fable—the grapes, the fox, the dismissive comment about sour grapes—allowed its message to persist.</p>

Our favorite from medicine: “idiopathic cardiomyopathy.” “Cardiomyopathy” means something is wrong with your heart, and “idiopathic” means “we have no idea why yours isn’t working.</p>

Language is often abstract, but life is not abstract. Teachers teach students about battles and animals and books. Doctors repair problems with our stomachs, backs, and hearts. Companies create software, build planes, distribute newspapers; they build cars that are cheaper, faster, or fancier than last year’s. Even the most abstract business strategy must eventually show up in the tangible actions of human beings. It’s easier to understand those tangible actions than to understand an abstract strategy statement—just as it’s easier to understand a fox dissing some grapes than an abstract commentary about the human psyche.</p>

California is one of only five Mediterranean climate regions in the world. (The others are the fynbos of South Africa, the matorral of Chile, the kwongan of Australia, and, of course, the Mediterranean.) These Mediterranean climate zones occupy only 2 percent of the world’s landmass but host more than 20 percent of its plant species. If you want to buy environmentally precious land, Mediterranean climates give you a lot of bang for your buck.</p>

These new strategies made sense—TNC could protect more areas than it could reach through “bucks and acres.” But they also had drawbacks. First, they were much less concrete to donors. Donors can’t “walk around on” a favorable government regulation. Second, they were also potentially demoralizing for employees—they made progress less tangible. When</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Page: 101
TNC was focused on land deals, Sweeney said, “it was easy to celebrate a deal closing, to tell everyone, ‘John and Mary got this land,’ and to pat them on the back.” These “milestone moments,” so great for morale, were harder to find in the new model. How could TNC make the new strategy more concrete?</p>

TNC named the oak savanna the Mount Hamilton Wilderness (based on its highest peak, the site of a local observatory). Identifying the area as a coherent landscape and naming it put it on the map for local groups and policymakers.</p>

The Mount Hamilton Wilderness is not a set of acres; it’s an eco-celebrity.</p>

This is not a story about land; it’s a story about abstraction. TNC avoided the trap of abstraction—saving 2 million acres per year—by converting abstract blobs on a map into tangible landscapes.</p>

Concreteness is an indispensable component of sticky ideas.</p>

Yale researcher Eric Havelock3 studies tales that have been passed down by word of mouth, such as the Iliad and the Odyssey. He notes that these tales are characterized by lots of concrete actions, with few abstractions. Why? The ancient Greeks certainly had no problem with abstraction—this was the society that produced Plato and Aristotle, after all. Havelock believes that the stories evolved away from abstraction over time. When they were passed along from generation to generation, the more memorable concrete details survived and the abstractions evaporated.</p>

To build such machinery, the firm needed two sets of skills: engineers who could create brilliant designs, and skilled manufacturing people who could transform those designs into complex physical machines. If the firm was to succeed, these two sets of people had to be able to communicate smoothly.</p>

It’s easy to lose awareness that we’re talking like an expert. We start to suffer from the Curse of Knowledge, like the tappers in the “tappers and listeners” game. It can feel unnatural to speak concretely about subject matter we’ve known intimately for years. But if we’re willing to make the effort we’ll see the rewards: Our audience will understand what we’re saying and remember it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 115
the moral of the story is to find a “universal language,” one that everyone speaks fluently. Inevitably, that universal language will be concrete.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 116
When Boeing prepared to launch the design of the 727 passenger plane in the 1960s, its managers set a goal that was deliberately concrete: The 727 must seat 131 passengers,8 fly nonstop from Miami to New York City, and land on Runway 4-22 at La Guardia. (The 4-22 runway was chosen for its length—less than a mile, which was much too short for any of the existing passenger jets.)</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 116
With a goal this concrete, Boeing effectively coordinated the actions</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 116
of thousands of experts in various aspects of engineering or manufacturing. Imagine how much harder it would have been to build a 727 whose goal was to be “the best passenger plane in the world.”</p>

Why does this happen? Because concreteness is a way of mobilizing and focusing your brain. For another example of this phenomenon, consider these two statements: (1) Think of five silly things that people have done in the world in the past ten years. (2) Think about five silly things your child has done in the past ten years.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 123
Concreteness creates a shared “turf” on which people can collaborate. Everybody in the room feels comfortable that they’re tackling the same challenge. Even experts—even the Kleiner Perkins venture capitalists, the rock stars of the technology world—benefit from concrete talk that puts them on common ground.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 129
To be simple—to find our core message—is quite difficult. (It’s certainly worth the effort, but let’s not kid ourselves that it’s easy.) Crafting our ideas in an unexpected way takes a fair amount of effort and applied creativity. But being concrete isn’t hard, and it doesn’t require a lot of effort. The barrier is simply forgetfulness—we forget that we’re slipping into abstractspeak. We forget that other people don’t know what we know. We’re the engineers who keep flipping back to our drawings, not noticing that the assemblers just want us to follow them down to the factory floor.</p>

A person’s knowledge of details is often a good proxy for her expertise.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 155
So far we’ve talked about creating credibility by drawing on external sources—authorities and antiauthorities. And we’ve talked about creating credibility by drawing on sources inside the message itself—by using details and statistics and examples that pass the Sinatra Test. But there’s one remaining source of credibility that we haven’t discussed. And it may be the most powerful source of all.</p>

The ads were a refreshing departure from the standard advertiser tool kit that attempts to paint powerful but irrelevant emotions on consumer goods—for instance, associating a mother’s love of her children with a particular brand of fabric softener.</p>

Wendy’s did something more admirable: It highlighted a genuine advantage of its product and presented it in an enjoyable way.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 156
the commercials developed a brand-new source of credibility: the audience. Wendy’s outsourced its credibility to its customers.</p>

event, to judge the event’s probability by its availability in our memory.</p>

It’s not always obvious which wellspring of credibility we should draw from. What Marshall showed so brilliantly was perseverance—knowing when it was time to draw on a different well. In this chapter we’ve seen that the most obvious sources of credibility—external validation and statistics—aren’t always the best. A few vivid</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 164
details might be more persuasive than a barrage of statistics. An antiauthority might work better than an authority. A single story that passes the Sinatra Test might overcome a mountain of skepticism. It’s inspirational to know that a medical genius like Marshall had to climb over the same hurdles with his idea as we’ll have to climb with ours—and to see that he eventually prevailed, to the benefit of us all.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 167
The researchers theorized that thinking about statistics shifts people into a more analytical frame of mind. When people think analytically, they’re less likely to think emotionally. And the researchers believed it was people’s emotional response to Rokia’s plight that led them to act.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 167
When people were primed to feel before they read about Rokia, they gave $2.34, about the same as before. But when they were primed to calculate before they read about Rokia, they gave $1.26.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 167
These results are shocking. The mere act of calculation reduced people’s charity. Once we put on our analytical hat, we react to emotional appeals differently. We hinder our ability to feel.</p>

IN THE LAST chapter, we discussed how to convince people that our ideas are credible, how to make them believe. Belief counts for a lot, but belief isn’t enough. For people to take action, they have to care.</p>

But self-interest isn’t the whole story. Principles—equality, individualism, ideals about government, human rights, and the like—may matter to us even when they violate our immediate self-interest.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 189
And perhaps the most important part of the story is this: “Group interest” is often a better predictor of political opinions than self-interest. Kinder says that in forming opinions people seem to ask not “What’s in it for me?” but, rather, “What’s in it for my group?” Our group affiliation may be based on race, class, religion, gender, region, political party, industry, or countless other dimensions of difference.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 190
This model is the standard view of decision-making in economics classes: People are self-interested and rational.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 190
The second model is quite different. It assumes that people make decisions based on identity. They ask themselves three questions: Who am I? What kind of situation is this?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 190
And what do people like me do in this kind of situation?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 190
There are no calculations, only norms and principles. Which sofa would someone like me—a Southeastern accountant—be more likely to buy? Which political candidate should a Hollywood Buddhist get behind?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 191
But from the perspective of the identity model of decision-making, turning down the popper makes perfect sense. The thought process would be more like this: “I’m a firefighter. You’re offering me a popcorn popper to get me to view a film on safety. But firefighters aren’t the kind of people who need little gifts to motivate us to learn about safety. We risk our lives, going into burning buildings to save people. Shame on you for implying that I need a popcorn popper!”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 191
to unite these two decision models. What if the marketer had offered to donate fifty dollars to a school’s fire-safety program in exchange for the firemen’s viewing the film? It’s less clear that this offer would have violated the firefighters’ sense of identity.</p>

People who imagine words that start with b or p can’t resist subtle lip movements, and people who imagine looking at the Eiffel Tower can’t resist moving their eyes upward. Mental simulation can even alter visceral physical responses: When people drink water but imagine that it’s lemon juice, they salivate more. Even more surprisingly, when people drink lemon juice but imagine that it’s water, they salivate less.</p>

Mental simulations help us manage emotions.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 212
Notice that these visualizations focus on the events themselves—the process, rather than the outcomes. No one has ever been cured of a phobia by imagining how happy they’ll be when it’s</p>

Mental simulation helps with problem-solving. Even in mundane planning situations, mentally simulating an event helps us think of things that we might otherwise have neglected.</p>

Research has suggested that mental rehearsal can prevent people from relapsing into bad habits such as smoking, excessive drinking, or overeating.</p>

Challenge plots are inspiring in a defined way. They inspire us by appealing to our perseverance and courage. They make us want to work harder, take on new challenges, overcome obstacles.</p>

Someone in charge of a vital operation needed information. He went looking for it, found it, and, as a result, was able to act more effectively.</p>

Denning talks about engaging the “little voice inside the head,”18 the voice that would normally debate the speaker’s points.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 234
“The conventional view of communication is to ignore the little voice inside the head and hope it stays quiet and that the message will somehow get through,”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 234
“Don’t ignore the little voice. … Instead, work in harmony with it. Engage it by giving it something to do. Tell a story in a way that elicits a second story from the little voice.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 234
In addition to creating buy-in, springboard stories mobilize people to act. Stories focus people on potential solutions. Telling stories with visible goals and barriers shifts the audience into a problem-solving mode.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 234
A springboard story is an exercise in mass customization—each audience member uses the story as a springboard to slightly different destinations.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 237
In the “Simple” and “Unexpected” chapters, we said that good messages must move from common sense to uncommon sense.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 243
The first villain is the natural tendency to bury the lead—to get lost in a sea of information.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 243
One of the worst things about knowing a lot, or having access to a lot of information, is that we’re tempted to share it all.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 244
The second villain is the tendency to focus on the presentation rather than on the message.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 244
The first is decision paralysis—the anxiety and irrationality that can emerge from excessive choice or ambiguous situations. Think about the students who missed both a fantastic lecture and a great film because they couldn’t decide which one was better, or how hard it was for Jeff Hawkins, the leader of the Palm Pilot development group, to get his team to focus on a few issues rather than on many. To beat decision paralysis, communicators have to do the hard work of finding the core.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 244
The archvillain of sticky ideas, as you know by now, is the Curse of Knowledge. The Stanford students didn’t face the Curse of Knowledge</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 244
them—they were more akin to reporters trying to avoid burying the lead on a news story than to experts who have forgotten what it’s like not to know something.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 244
The Curse of Knowledge is a worthy adversary, because in some sense it’s inevitable. Getting a message across has two stages: the Answer stage and the Telling Others stage. In the Answer stage, you use your expertise to arrive at the idea that you want to share. Doctors study for a decade to be capable of giving the Answer. Business managers may deliberate for months to arrive at the Answer.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 245
Here’s the rub: The same factors that worked to your advantage in the Answer stage will backfire on you during the Telling Others stage. To get the Answer, you need expertise, but you can’t dissociate expertise from the Curse of Knowledge. You know things that others don’t know, and you can’t remember what it was like not to know those things. So when you get around to sharing the Answer, you’ll tend to communicate as if your audience were you.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 245
There is a curious disconnect between the amount of time we invest in training people how to arrive at the Answer and the amount of time we invest in training them how to Tell Others.</p>

Or create mysteries or puzzles that are slowly solved over the course of the communication.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 248
Make the message simpler and use concrete language.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 248
Or use concrete, real-world examples. Don’t talk about “knowledge management”; tell a story about a health worker in Zambia getting information on malaria from the Internet.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 248
Create a highly concrete turf where people can apply their knowledge. (Think of the venture-capital pitch for a portable computer where the entrepreneur tossed his binder onto the table, sparking brainstorming.) Have people grapple with specific examples or cases rather than concepts.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 248
Find the telling details for your message—the equivalent of the dancing seventy-three-year-old man, or the textile factory so environmentally friendly that it actually cleans the water pouring through it. Use fewer authorities and more antiauthorities.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 249
“They quibble with everything I say” or “I spend all my time arguing with them about this.” SOLUTION: Quiet the audience’s mental skeptics by using a springboard story, switching them into creative mode.</p>

The Charisma Myth: Master the Art of Personal Magnetism

charisma is a skill that you can learn and practice.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 85
It can determine whether you’re seen as a follower or a leader,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 85
whether your ideas get adopted, and how effectively your projects are implemented.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 105
It’s Not Magic, It’s Learned Behaviors</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 129
When you meet a charismatic person, you get the impression that they have a lot of power and they like you a lot.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 131
impression that you possess both high power and high warmth, since charismatic behaviors project a combination of these two qualities.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 132
“Fight or flight?” is the power question. “Friend or foe?” is the warmth question.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 135
Presence is the single most requested aspect of charisma when I’m coaching executives.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 138
you not only feel his power and a sense of warm engagement, you also feel that he’s completely here with you, in this moment. Present.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 145
It involves managing your mental ecosystem, understanding and attending to your own needs, as well as knowing which behaviors inspire others to see you as charismatic and learning how to project them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 153
The world will become your lab, and every time you meet someone, you’ll get an opportunity to experiment.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 164
“After dining with Mr. Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest person in England. But after dining with Mr. Disraeli, I thought I was the cleverest person in England.” Guess who won the election? It was the man who made others feel intelligent, impressive, and fascinating: Benjamin Disraeli.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 174
But introversion is not a terminal handicap. In fact, as we’ll see, it can be a strong advantage for certain forms of charisma.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 181
Last but not least, you won’t have to change your personality. In order to become more charismatic, you don’t have to force yourself into one particular personality style</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 185
Lower the intonation of your voice at the end of your sentences. Reduce how quickly and how often you nod. Pause for two full seconds before you speak.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 222
CHARISMATIC BEHAVIOR CAN be broken down into three core elements: presence, power, and warmth.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 225
In order to be charismatic, we need to choose mental states that make our body language, words, and behaviors flow together and express the three core elements of charisma.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 285
When you’re fully present, it shows in your body language in a highly charisma-enhancing way.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 286
Being charismatic does not depend on how much time you have but on how fully present you are in each interaction.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 288
The people you’re with feel that they have your full attention and that they are the most important thing in the world to you at that moment.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 298
“In most moments we have a continuous internal commentary on what is happening and what we should do next. We might greet a friend with a hug, but the warmth of our greeting becomes blurred by our computations about how long to embrace or what we’re going to say when we’re done. We rush through the motions, not fully present.” Being present enables you to fully notice and drink in the good moments.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 307
We look for clues of power in someone’s appearance, in others’ reaction to this person, and, most of all, in the person’s body language.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 308
others. Warmth tells us whether or not people will want to use whatever power they have in our favor.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 310
Warmth is assessed almost entirely through body language and behavior; it’s evaluated more directly than power.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 322
warmth. The combination of power and warmth would have been very rare and very, very precious:</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 327
From lab experiments to neuroimaging, research has consistently shown that they are the two dimensions we evaluate first and foremost in assessing other people.3 Both power and warmth are necessary conditions for charisma.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 341
Though this may sound incredible—how could words carry so little weight compared to the body language of the person delivering them?—it actually makes sense. In the scope of human evolution, language is a relatively recent invention.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 344
This is why nonverbal communication has a far greater impact.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 359
The second consequence is that our body language expresses our mental state whether we like it or not.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 364
(remember, people can read your face in as little as seventeen milliseconds).</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 375
Thus, the first step in learning charisma—and what the first part of this book is all about—is developing the various mental states that produce charismatic body language and behaviors.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 389
Individuals with strong internal skills are aware of what exactly is happening inside them and know how to handle</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 399
“To know others is knowledge. To know oneself is wisdom.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 400
Knowing your internal world starts with one key insight upon which all charisma is built: your mind can’t tell fact from fiction. This is the one dimension of your internal world that can help you get into the right charismatic mental state at will, and almost instantly.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 423
The placebo effect is the basis for many of the best charisma-enhancing techniques,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 436
When you exhibit presence, those around you feel listened to, respected, and valued.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 438
exhibit presence, power, and warmth—you must display charismatic body language.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 440
by creating a charismatic internal state your body language will authentically display charisma.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 441
critical. Get the internal state right, and the right charismatic behaviors and body language will pour forth automatically.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 472
In fact, that’s probably exactly what will happen, because most of us tend to interpret events—whether they’re personal or impersonal—as relating to us.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 475
When interacting with someone, assume that he or she will feel (at least on a subconscious level) that whatever you do relates to him or to her.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 482
Prevent Recognize Remedy or explain</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 484
“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 492
(this means you can take deep belly breaths, not shallow chest breaths). How well you breathe affects how much oxygen gets to your brain, and therefore how well you perform mentally.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 524
For many of us, a state of doubt or uncertainty is an uncomfortable place to be.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 526
Our inability to tolerate uncertainty carries multiple costs.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 529
Anxiety is a serious drawback to charisma. First, it impacts our internal state: quite obviously, it’s hard to be fully present while you’re feeling anxious. Anxiety can also lower our confidence. Anxiety, low presence, and low confidence can show up directly in our body language, as well as reduce our ability to emanate warmth.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 531
Yet if there’s one thing that’s certain, it’s that uncertainty isn’t going away.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 533
Those who are better at handling it will gain a distinctive advantage over others.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 537
But how many of us have felt our minds going over the different outcomes again and again, rehashing the various plans we’ve made, replaying possible scenarios, mentally rehearsing the upcoming conversations not just once or twice but ad nauseam?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 547
The reason Tom couldn’t let go is that our minds are fundamentally uncomfortable with uncertainty.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 548
The minute our brain registers ambiguity, it flashes an error signal. Uncertainty registers as a tension: something that must be corrected before we can feel comfortable again.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 549
Our natural discomfort with uncertainty is yet another legacy of our survival instincts. We tend to be more comfortable with what is familiar, which obviously hasn’t killed us yet, than with what is unknown or uncertain, which could turn out to be dangerous.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 552
the ability to be comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity turns out to be one of the strongest predictors of success in business.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 558
The single most effective technique I’ve found to alleviate the discomfort of uncertainty is the responsibility transfer.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 577
If you did feel something happen, fantastic: you’ve just performed a responsibility transfer.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 580
The reason this technique works is that when presented with a scenario, our brain’s first reaction is to consider it as possible.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 585
may last only a brief moment, it’s enough to produce an emotional and physical reassurance,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 591
However, the responsibility transfer works without trying to negate uncertainty. Instead, it helps you to be less affected by it, drawing you out of the negative mental and physical states that often accompany a position of not knowing.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 593
By presenting your mind with the possibility that responsibility has been transferred, you’re putting to good use the wonderful placebo effect—the brain’s inability to distinguish between imagination and reality.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 603
Personally, I’ve chosen to believe in a benevolent Universe, which has a grand master plan for me (and for everything else).</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 605
perform a quick visualization to transfer responsibility. It’s amazing to feel the instant sense of relief and the warmth, calm, and serenity rising. I feel my whole body relax, and it’s as if my whole being starts to glow.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 607
Dissatisfaction Caused by Comparison</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 611
Human beings are by nature driven to compare.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 614
The very act of comparing and evaluating hinders our ability to be fully present.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 616
And a negative evaluation can easily put us in a negative mental state, such as dissatisfaction, envy, or resentment.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 623
Few things impact people’s performance more than how they feel about themselves.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 624
Athletes will tell you that a bad mental state will affect their performance no matter how well prepared they are physically. Psychological negativity can have real physical consequences.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 625
When our internal voice starts criticizing us, lashing out, it can feel like we’re under attack. Because our brain doesn’t distinguish between imagination and reality, these internal attacks are perceived by our mind just as a real, physical attack would be, and they can generate an automatic physical reaction known as the threat response or fight-or-flight response.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 628
The effects of this activation are well-known. Just as a zebra reacts to the stress of being chased by a lion, the human body shoots adrenaline and cortisol (stress hormones) through its veins, and directs all its resources toward crucial functions: elevated heart and breathing rates, muscle reaction, vision acuity, and so forth. The body is no longer concerned with living ten more years, but with surviving ten more minutes. It shuts down nonurgent functions such as muscle repair, digestion, and the immune system,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 633
In other words, because it’s not critical to survival, intelligent thinking gets shut down.</p>
<p>Pink highlight | Location: 633
David Rock, founder of the NeuroLeadership Institute, explains that “the threat response impairs analytic thinking, creative insight, and problem solving.”7 This kind of negativity doesn’t just affect our actual performance, it also affects how others perceive us.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 639
No matter how brief that negative expression, the person facing you is going to spot it. And all they know is that while you were looking at them and listening to them, a negative expression crossed your face. Naturally they’ll assume that expression was a reaction to them—what they said or did, or what you thought about them. This is how internal negativity affects your body language, and thus your charisma, in addition to your performance.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 642
Self-criticism is one of the most common obstacles to great performance in any field.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 646
“Eighty percent of my day is spent fighting my inner critic.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 650
enough. In one of the manifestations of self-doubt, known as the impostor syndrome, competent people feel they don’t really know what they’re doing and are just waiting for someone to expose them as a fraud.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 654
But already, just knowing the universality of such feelings can help us neutralize their effect and reduce their power.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 668
The difficult feelings we experience are a natural by-product of one of our most useful survival mechanisms.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 669
Feelings like fear or anxiety are designed to get you to do something. They’re uncomfortable because they’re “designed” to be uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 706
Feeling internal discomfort and negativity is a natural part of life. Everyone experiences it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 713
we feel they “shouldn’t” be happening. So not only do we feel bad, we then also feel bad about feeling bad.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 735
The brain equates social needs with survival; being hungry and being ostracized activate similar neural responses.1 Somewhere in the back of our minds is the fear of being so disapproved-of that we’d be excluded by those who matter to our survival.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 740
that the tendency to feel bad about feeling bad is especially true for good people.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 767
whatever I’ve seen may well be the sign of how they’re feeling about themselves, an itchy wool suit, or something else entirely.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 784
reality. But sometimes our mind will present us with a seriously distorted view of reality. And the distortion often skews negative because the elements that our danger-focused brain deems important</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 785
are usually the most negative ones. This tendency is called the negativity bias, and</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 798
When your brain spins negative scenarios, remind yourself that you may not be getting an accurate perception of reality.</p>

failure is seldom fatal, and just realizing that even the worst-case scenario is survivable can bolster your confidence.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 830
thoughts. We want to avoid falling into the trap of arguing with them or trying to suppress them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 837
Because trying to suppress a self-critical thought only makes it more central to your thinking, it’s a far better strategy to simply aim to neutralize it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 850
Once the fight-or-flight response is aroused, it’s hard to quiet down.</p>

If you aimed to simply suppress the anger, you would pay a high price.</p>

But what if you happened to learn that this apparently reckless driver was actually a distraught mother whose baby was choking in the backseat, and she was desperately trying to pull over into the breakdown lane while reaching back to save her baby’s life?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 857
Deciding to change your belief about what happened (technically called cognitive reappraisal) effectively decreases the brain’s stress levels.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 859
The researchers concluded that deciding to change beliefs was a far more effective and healthier solution than attempting to repress or ignore emotions.4 In most situations, we don’t know for certain what motivates a person’s actions, so we might as well choose the explanation that is most helpful to us and create a version of events that gets us into the specific mental state we need for charisma.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 863
first, choosing to rewrite your perception of reality is actually the rational and smart thing to do.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 864
It can help you get back into the right mental state to emanate charismatic body language and can improve</p>

What if this unfortunate, unpleasant experience is absolutely perfect just as it is—the insomnia, the nausea, the fact that this is happening the very night before a high-profile assignment?</p>

In what way can this turn out to be absolutely perfect for me?</p>

“I decide to interpret everything favorably toward myself.</p>

It’s not just that I’m optimistic, I’m actually conveniently deluded.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 891
Once again, we can thank the brain’s tendency to accept imagination as reality.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 894
rather than trying to suppress or ignore your internal difficulties, consider a few alternate versions of reality. Conjure a few different scenarios that would induce</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 904
Was this pleasant? Definitely not. Effective? Absolutely. Within one month, I was able to</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 955
By using these two exercises, rewriting reality and getting satisfaction, you can choose your perception of the situation—one that allows you to be both effective and charismatic.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 958
destigmatize discomfort, neutralize negativity, and rewrite reality.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 989
Being comfortable with discomfort.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 996
The answer, surprisingly, is to delve into those very sensations of discomfort. That’s right. Though it sounds counterintuitive, rather than trying to suppress, ignore, or power through them, your goal is to give your full attention to the very sensations you’d instinctively want to push away.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,000
In fact, this technique, called delving into sensations, can help you access charismatic presence even during highly uncomfortable situations.</p>

As far as his charisma was concerned, the energy he was using to try to suppress his impatience was only making things worse.</p>

I’ve often heard professional negotiators tell me that they could accurately predict the outcome of negotiations fairly early on using one simple clue: whoever has less endurance for silence loses.</p>

Remind yourself that you’re not doing anything illegal! The only thing that’s holding you back is social customs. You can</p>

Golfer Jack Nicklaus said that he never hit a shot, even during practice, without visualizing it first.</p>

If their internal emotions were not what they wanted the outside world to see, sooner or later, something of these underlying thoughts and feelings would show.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,106
Because of its powerful mental and physiological effects, visualization is one of the most effective charisma-boosting tools available.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,108
Just by using the right mental images, your subconscious mind will send a remarkable chain reaction of confidence signals cascading through your body. In fact, you can display nearly any body language just by picking the right visualization.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,123
The next time you do this exercise, aim to create images that are even more detailed. Guided imagery must be precise, vivid, and detailed to be effective, says Harvard-trained visualization specialist Stephen Krauss. When visualization is used with Olympic ski teams, skiers visualize themselves careening through the entire course, feeling their muscles tensing, experiencing each bump and turn in their minds.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,151
Visualization is truly a miracle method, helping you boost confidence, emanate more warmth, replace anxiety with calm serenity, or gain access to whichever emotion you’d like to feel and then broadcast it through your body language.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,175
I’ve even found visualization helpful before writing important e-mails. Just as the right visualization helps you get into the right body language so that the right signals flow effortlessly, you can use visualization to get into specific emotional or mental states so that the right words flow as well.</p>

Gratitude is a great antidote to all of these negative feelings because it comes from thinking of things you already have—from material items or experiences to cherished relationships.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,220
Gratitude can be a great charisma conduit, bringing you back to the present and giving you immediate access to feelings of both confidence and warmth.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,222
gratitude helps you live longer, healthier, and even happier.</p>

During a recent lunch meeting at a restaurant, for instance, I focused on little delights: the sun streaming through the window; blue skies; that the waiter got my order right; or the existence, availability, and wonders of ketchup.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,297
When our only aim is to broadcast goodwill, it takes the pressure off. We’re no longer striving, struggling, pushing for things to go in a certain direction.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,298
And since we’re less concerned about how the interaction goes, we can both feel and project more charismatic confidence.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,303
One simple but effective way to start is to try to find three things you like about the person you want to feel goodwill toward.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,308
First, a visualization. This one comes from neuroscientist Dr. Privahini Bradoo,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,309
imagine the person you’re speaking to, and all those around you, as having invisible angel wings.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,316
If you respond better to auditory guides, try a few different phrases. For instance, while looking at someone, think, I like you. And I like you just for you. Or try to remember this guideline: Just love as much as you can from wherever you are.</p>

Your willingness to focus on others’ well-being is all you need to positively change your body language.</p>

“Why would people like me? Even I don’t find myself likable.”</p>

As you can imagine, this cold internal message resonated in her head, played across her body language, and diminished how much warmth she could emanate.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,366
Self-confidence is our belief in our ability to do or to learn how to do something.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,367
Self-esteem is how much we approve of or value ourselves. It’s often a comparison-based evaluation (whether measured against other people or against our own internal standards for approval).</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,369
Self-compassion is how much warmth we can have for ourselves, especially when we’re going through a difficult experience.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,370
have high self-confidence but low self-esteem and very low self-compassion.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,373
may be healthier to focus on self-compassion than on self-esteem.6</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,374
Self-esteem is more of a roller coaster, contingent on how we believe we compare to others. It also tends to correlate with narcissism.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,375
Individuals who score high on self-compassion scales demonstrate greater emotional resilience to daily difficulties and fewer negative reactions to difficult situations, such as receiving unflattering feedback.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,377
Higher self-compassion predicts a greater sense of personal responsibility for the outcome of events: it helps predict levels of accountability. People who score high on self-compassion also have a lower tendency for denial. This makes sense: personal mistakes would generate less self-criticism, so people would be more willing to admit to them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,383
self-compassion is feeling that what happened to you is unfortunate, whereas self-pity is feeling that what happened to you is unfair. In this way, self-pity can lead to resentment or bitterness, and to feeling more isolated and alienated. In contrast, self-compassion often leads to increased feelings of connectedness.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,394
Self-compassion delivers an impressive array of benefits: decreased anxiety, depression, and self-criticism; improved relationships and greater feelings of social connectedness and satisfaction with life; increased ability</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,396
to handle negative events; and even improved immune system functioning.</p>

As Germer puts it: “A moment of self-compassion can change your entire day. A string of such moments can change the course of your life.”</p>

I was walking up the Gran Via in Madrid, feeling tired, hungry, lonely, unfashionably dressed, and the epitome of an ugly American. The attitude was definitely not working for me, so what to do? I decided that I was a movie star incognito. I stood up straighter, shoulders back, head erect, with the posture that I imagine I would have if I were royalty. Suddenly the dress that had seemed so out of place a moment ago felt like an amazing fashion statement, something that everyone else should copy. I noticed as I walked down the street that heads were turning, all of them. When I asked a man for directions, he said he would be honored if I would allow him to show me the way. It was amazing. From one second to the next, I went from a dowdy, frumpy, ugly stranger to a head-turning movie star. It was memorable. And enlightening.</p>

Throughout this chapter we’ll look at four distinct kinds of charisma: focus, visionary, kindness, and authority.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,610
Remember that one of the foundations of charisma is making other people feel good about themselves.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,625
This is where you need to balance focus with warmth and acceptance or genuine respect,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,628
situations. It’s particularly useful when you need people to open up and share information.</p>

“He spoke with such conviction, such passion, he had all of our neurons screaming, Yes! I get it! I’m with you!!!”</p>

Conveying visionary charisma requires the ability to project complete conviction and confidence in a cause.</p>

Continue with an open-ended question, such as “What’s the story behind it?” The word story has a very strong emotional effect</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,964
Instead, focus on questions that will likely elicit positive emotions. With your questions, you have the power to lead the conversation in the direction you want.</p>

Charismatic people are masters at using positive associations, whether consciously or subconsciously,</p>

When you craft your images and metaphors, try to make them sensory-rich: involve as many of the five senses as possible.</p>

Entertainment: Make your e-mail or meeting enjoyable. Information: Give interesting or informative content that they can use. Good feelings: Find ways to make them feel important or good about themselves.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,234
Pause. People who broadcast confidence often pause while speaking. They will pause for a second or two between sentences or even in the middle of a sentence. This conveys the feeling that they’re so confident in their power, they trust that people won’t interrupt.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,259

What the speaker was saying was clearly not important to his spellbinding power. How he was saying it was enough.</p>

Words are grasped first by people’s cognitive minds, their logical side, which gets to work on understanding their meaning.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,276
Body language, in contrast, affects us on a visceral, emotional level. It’s this emotional level that you need to access in order to inspire others to follow, care for, or obey you.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,277
“Logic makes people think. Emotion makes them act.”</p>

On the other hand, with the right body language you can succeed even with an imperfect message.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,295
As a leader, the emotions conveyed by your body language, even during brief, casual encounters, can have a ripple effect through your team or even your entire company.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,297
This ripple effect is due to the mirror neurons in our brain,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,304
Within organizations, leaders’ emotions always propagate fastest because people are strongly affected by those in a position of power</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,318
This tendency to mimic the body language of others is technically called limbic resonance,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,319
thanks to a certain class of neurons called oscillators, which coordinate people physically by regulating how and when their bodies move together.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,323
Imitating someone’s body language is an easy way to establish trust and rapport.</p>

mirroring someone’s body language can get them to pick up your dropped items, buy your products, or give you a better deal.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,330
During your next few conversations, try to mirror the other person’s overall posture: the way they hold their head, how they place their feet, the shifts in their weight. If they move their left hand, move your right hand. Aim also to adapt your voice to theirs in speed, pitch, and intonation.</p>

Only when it’s your turn to speak should you start infusing the interaction with warmth, caring, and compassion through your voice, face, and eyes. As you speak, gradually shift into a more relaxed, calm, and, eventually, confident posture. There’s a good chance that she’ll follow.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,377
Mirror-then-lead is a smart strategy when the person you’re interacting with needs reassurance</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,383
Rather than mirroring, try breaking him out of his posture by handing him something: a piece of paper or a pen—whatever works.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,384
And then, as soon as he’s in a new position, distract him by giving him new information or changing the subject while you mirror his posture to reestablish rapport.</p>

Remember, our physiology affects our psychology.</p>

As long as their body is in a certain emotional mode, it will be nearly impossible to get their mind to feel something different.</p>

Our eyes are a key part of our nonverbal communication, perhaps the single most important one. Why are eyes called the “windows to the soul”? Because they are the most mobile part of the entire face—and so, the most expressive.</p>

Empathy: wanting to ensure that the other person feels heard and understood and knows you’re paying attention Insecurity: wanting to please or appease the person you’re interacting with</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,554
people who come across as powerful, confident, or high-status are usually more contained; they don’t feel the urge to give so much reassurance because they’re not as worried about what their counterpart is thinking.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,558
The first is excessive or rapid nodding.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,560
The second hindrance is excessive verbal reassurance: making a sound, such as “uh-huh,” or a half-sentence, such as “Oh, I agree.” Done once, and consciously, this is fine; multiple times per sentence is not.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,598
While our words speak to a person’s logical mind, our nonverbal communication speaks to a person’s emotional mind.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,601
When verbal and nonverbal messages contradict, we tend to trust what we see in the other person’s body language more than what we hear them say.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,635
“right” charisma style depends on your personality, the situation, your goals, and the person you’re dealing with.</p>

“I did something nice for this person, so I must like him. I wouldn’t have agreed to do a favor for someone I dislike.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,663
Remember, it’ll make them rationalize their actions in your favor. “Wow, I really did go all-out for this person. I must really like them.”</p>

“We all crave honest appreciation. It’s a gnawing and unfaltering human hunger; and the rare individual who satisfies it will hold people in the palm of his hand.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,681
Remember John Kenneth Galbraith’s quote about our strong preference to prove ourselves correct rather than change our minds.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,685
If someone feels like they’ve done you harm, they will seek to rationalize their actions and will convince themselves that what they did was justified.</p>

Once they are reassured of their own worth, people will accept your comments far more easily, and they’ll get less defensive.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,835
That takes who was right or wrong off the table and focuses instead on something you can both agree on without anyone having to win or lose.</p>

Having a disagreement or a conflict can actually improve a relationship and be a great thing in the end.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,868
Once you get through a difficult situation and it was well handled, you know that the relationship can withstand difficulty.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,877
Forgiving yourself and getting into a good mental state also helps you avoid appearing overly apologetic, subservient, or insecure.</p>

Be strategic: make sure you’re getting value out of each nonverbal gesture you make, and limit superfluous gestures to avoid wasting any bit of your audience’s attention.</p>

If, instead, you can make it all about your audience—wondering how they’re doing—you take the focus off yourself, lift your self-consciousness, and get into a state of goodwill, which will be read and appreciated by the audience.</p>

Second, express high expectations. Sometimes, simply assigning to people the labels you want them to live up to is enough.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 3,217
“expressing high performance expectations” of people while “communicating a high degree of confidence” in their ability to meet those expectations was the hallmark of charismatic leadership.</p>

Crisis creates uncertainty, which creates angst, and people will cling to whatever they feel diminishes this angst. This is why faith, vision, and authority have such power in times of crisis.</p>

I told Nancy that the only way her success wouldn’t make him feel envious or resentful was if he could see it as his success, too. I encouraged her to give Kevin this sense of ownership by finding some way he might have participated in her success.</p>

The Power of Moments: Why Certain Experiences Have Extraordinary Impact
Chip Heath and Dan Heath
Last accessed on Tuesday January 22, 2019
177 Highlight(s) | 5 Note(s)
Yellow highlight | Location: 234
Moments matter.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 235
All it takes is a bit of insight and fore-thought.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 252
To avoid this kind of oversight, we must understand when special moments are needed. We must learn to think in moments, to spot the occasions that are worthy of investment.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 254
This “moment-spotting” habit can be unnatural. In organizations, for instance, we are consumed with goals. Time is meaningful only insofar as it clarifies or measures our goals. The goal is the thing.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 255
But for an individual human being, moments are the thing. Moments are what we remember and what we cherish. Certainly we might celebrate achieving a goal, such as completing a marathon or landing a significant client—but the achievement is embedded in a moment.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 261
We’ll explore three situations that deserve punctuation: transitions, milestones, and pits.</p>
<p>Blue highlight | Location: 265
crisp up an otherwise gradual evolution</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 269
That logic shows why the first day of work is an experience worth investing in. For new employees, it’s three big transitions at once: intellectual (new work), social (new people), and environmental (new place).</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 342
So “fresh starts” happen not only on New Year’s Day, but also on any other landmark date. If you’re struggling to make a transition, create a defining moment that draws a dividing line between Old You and New You.</p>

The little girl asked, “Can we come back tomorrow?” Dietz began to weep. He had transformed terror into delight.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 443
since the scans go faster, the hospitals can complete more in a day.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 445
For patients, a moment of agony was transformed into a moment of elevation. Dietz flipped a pit into a peak.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 447
Transitions should be marked, milestones commemorated, and pits filled.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 451
The point we’re emphasizing here is that certain circumstances demand attention.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 537
Times to be savored. Moments that make us feel engaged, joyful, amazed, motivated. They are peaks.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 556
The book was his “attempt to trace the defects of society back to the defects of human nature.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 658
“Studies have consistently shown that reliability, dependability, and competence meet customer expectations,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 661
Most service executives are ignoring the research about meeting versus exceeding expectations.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 685
In other words, the happiest people in any industry tend to spend more, so moving a 4 to a 7 generates more additional spending than moving</p>

If you Elevate the Positives (Plan B), you’ll earn about 9 times more revenue than if you Eliminate the Negatives (Plan A).</p>

Research has shown, again and again, that we tend to obsess about problems and negative information.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 698
“Bad Is Stronger than Good.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 698
So, when it comes to the way service executives think, it’s not surprising that bad is stronger than good. Their attention is naturally drawn to the customers who had the worst experiences. But in indulging that instinct, they miss an enormous opportunity. To be clear,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 705
How do you build peaks? You create a positive moment with elements of elevation, insight, pride, and/or connection.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 707
To elevate a moment, do three things: First, boost sensory appeal. Second, raise the stakes. Third, break the script.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 741
Why? It’s no one’s job, and it’s a hassle, and there’s always something happening that seems more urgent. This same dynamic is what makes it so hard to create peaks in our personal lives as well.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 749
We’re not trying to pop your balloon. Rather, we want to build your determination: It’s going to be way harder than you think to create peaks. But once you’ve done it, you’re going to consider every ounce of effort worth it. You will have created your own defining moments.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 790
We may have more time to live than he did, but should that be a reason to put them off?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 829
Breaking the script—defying people’s expectations of how an experience will unfold—is the third method.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,000
Novelty even changes our perception of time. In an experiment conducted by Vani Pariyadath and David Eagleman of Baylor College of Medicine, participants were shown a series of images. Most of them were identical, but every now</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,004
This misperception has become known as the “oddball effect.”12</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,011
In other words, surprise stretches time.</p>

Afterward, they are asked to estimate how long the fall took, and their estimates are, on average, too high by 36%. Their fear and focus make time seem to expand. (So here’s one tip to live a “longer” life:</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,024
By breaking the script, we can lay down a richer set of memories. As the authors of the book Surprise put it, “We feel most comfortable when things are certain, but we feel most alive when they’re not.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,044
• Novelty actually seems to slow down time. That’s why we feel like time goes faster as we age.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,197
When you have a sudden realization, one that you didn’t see coming, and one that you know viscerally is right, you’ve tripped over the truth.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,224
CLTS facilitators see the problem vividly, but they don’t share their concerns directly. They let the villagers see for themselves. The “aha!” moment should always happen in the minds of the audience.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,226
This three-part recipe—a (1) clear insight (2) compressed in time and (3) discovered by the audience itself—provides a blueprint for us when we want people to confront uncomfortable truths.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,230
To trip is to catch one’s foot on something and stumble. To trip over the truth is to catch one’s brain on something and struggle. What exactly is the “something</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,234
Your focus, in other words, would be on the virtues of the solution. But in the stories we’ve seen so far in this chapter, you’ll notice that no one is talking about solutions.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,237
What they did, instead, was dramatize the problems:</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,239
You can’t appreciate the solution until you appreciate the problem. So when we talk about “tripping over the truth,” we mean the truth about a problem or harm. That’s what sparks sudden insight.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,246
Over the course of the week at Palmer’s CDI, the professors learn the science of teaching: how to motivate students, how to reach different types of learners, and how to ensure that students retain the most important</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,249
“backward-integrated design.” First, you identify your goals. Second, you figure out how you’d assess whether students had hit those goals. Third, you design activities that would prepare students to excel at those assessments.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,259
Now put yourself in Palmer’s shoes. He knows professors are approaching curriculum design the wrong way, and he has a solution for them (backward-integrated design). If he pitched the virtues of the solution, that would make him, in essence, a salesman for backward-integrated design.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,261
But how do audiences respond to sales pitches? With skepticism. We quibble and challenge and question.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,262
If Palmer wants to persuade the professors, he needs them to trip over the truth. And that starts with a focus on the problem, not the solution.</p>

An airplane flying is a study in pressure and drag; a collision turns into a problem in momentum; a rainbow becomes an awesome show of refraction and dispersion; an earthquake illustrates shear forces and flexibility; bridge construction is about heat and expansion; a concert hall is the interplay of reflection and interference.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,355
Research suggests that reflecting or ruminating on our thoughts and feelings is an ineffective way to achieve true understanding.4 Studying our own behavior is more fruitful.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,359
Action leads to insight more often than insight leads to action.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,363
Self-understanding comes slowly. One of the few ways to accelerate it—to experience more crystallizing moments—is to stretch for insight.</p>

More than thirty years later, Michael Dinneen looks back on that night as one of the defining moments of his life. It was the first time he had lost a patient.6 But what sticks with him nearly as much is what the night taught him about himself: I can endure.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,396
Others, like Dinneen, discover that they can survive the experiences, and that the potential negative peaks are outweighed by the positive.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,397
Dinneen never would have learned about his ability to endure had he not been pushed and supported by Ridenour. “I was expected to get back in the game,” said Dinneen. “He knew I had it in me to make it through that night when I didn’t know that myself.” Ridenour’s wise actions in the middle of the night transformed a moment of trauma into a moment of growth.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,403
Mentors focus on improvement: Can you push a little bit further? Can you shoulder a little more responsibility? They introduce a productive level of stress.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,419
good starting place is a two-part formula cited in a paper by the psychologist David Scott Yeager and eight colleagues: high standards + assurance.8 Yeager described a study in a suburban junior high school in which 44 seventh-grade students were assigned to write an essay about a personal hero.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,422
Their teachers then marked up the essays, providing written feedback.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,434
High standards + assurance is a powerful formula, but ultimately it’s just a statement of expectations. What great mentors do is add two more elements: direction and support.</p>

her father would ask them a question every week at the dinner table: “What did you guys fail at this week?”</p>
<p>Note:Good qauedstgion</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,517
“If we had nothing to tell him, he’d be disappointed,” Blakely said. “The logic seems counterintuitive, but it worked beautifully. He knew that many people become paralyzed by the fear of failure. They’re constantly afraid of what others will think if they don’t do a great job and, as a result, take no risks. My father wanted us to try everything and feel free to push the envelope. His attitude taught me to define failure as not trying something I want to do instead of not achieving the right outcome.” His question, “What did you guys fail at this week?” was a push to stretch. It was an attempt to normalize failure, to make it part of a casual dinner conversation. Because when you seek out situations where you might fail, failure loses some of its menace. You’ve been inoculated against it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,531
The promise of stretching is not success, it’s learning. It’s self-insight. It’s the promise of gleaning the answers to some of the most important and vexing questions of our lives: What do we want? What can we do? Who can we be? What can we endure?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,539

Keith Risinger, who works in leadership development at Eli Lilly, has made recognition a hallmark of his management style.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,721
About a month later, Risinger kicked off a sales meeting with the story of Hughes’s progress with Dr. Singh, highlighting the value of asking more questions and listening to the answers. To commemorate the occasion he awarded Hughes a symbol of his quality listening: a pair of Bose headphones.</p>

Maybe your managerial style is different;</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,733
The style is not important. What’s important is authenticity: being personal not programmatic. And frequency: closer to weekly than yearly. And of course what’s most important is the message: “I saw what you did and I appreciate it.”</p>

The common goal to “get in shape” is ambiguous and un-motivating. Pursuing it puts you on a path with no clear destination and no intermediate moments to celebrate.</p>

By using Kamb’s level-up strategy, we multiply the number of motivating milestones we encounter en route to a goal. That’s a forward-looking strategy:</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,890
We’re anticipating moments of pride ahead. But the opposite is also possible: to surface those milestones you’ve already met but might not have noticed.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,921
A numerical goal plus supporting plans. Notice what that combination leaves us with: A destination that is not inherently motivating and that lacks meaningful milestones along the way. As a result, achieving the “20 by 2020” goal</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,925
We should be careful that we don’t let this corporate style of goal-setting infiltrate our personal lives, where we’re in full control. “I’m going to lose 10 pounds in 2 months,” for instance, is a classic corporate goal: arbitrary, numerical, and lacking intermediate milestones.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,928
By now, you know what to do: Restore the milestones. Level up: Go one week straight without using the elevator. Pick out 2 microbrews to enjoy on Saturday after a full week without booze. If I jog continuously for three songs on my playlist, that entitles me to download three new ones. And so on.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,944
The same logic applies to milestones involving less tangible goals, such as building leadership</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,944
skills. In most organizations, the only clear “levels” en route to leadership positions are promotions. But what if it takes five years for an employee to earn a promotion, or what if she is not interested in or suited for a promotion? How do you create the intermediate milestones that could provide moments of pride?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,958
Hitting a milestone sparks pride. It should also spark a celebration—a moment of elevation. (Don’t forget that milestones, along with pits and transitions, are three natural defining moments that deserve extra attention.) Milestones deserve peaks.</p>

“From my experience, the most common trait you will consistently observe in accomplished people is an obsession with completion.6 Once a project falls into their horizon, they crave almost compulsively, to finish it.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,004
What milestones do is compel us to make that push, because (a) they’re within our grasp, and (b) we’ve chosen them precisely because they’re worth reaching for. Milestones define moments that are conquerable and worth conquering. A Boy Scout spends one more</p>

“Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear—not absence of fear.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,074
Rather, they are describing moments of courage.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,079
The military understands this concept well. As the psychologist S. J. Rachman wrote in a report on military training, “What might be called ‘training for courage’ plays an important part in preparing people to undertake dangerous jobs such as fire-fighting or parachuting.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,091
That element—“gradual and graduated practice”—is also the hallmark of exposure therapy, one of the most effective techniques for reducing phobias (irrational fears).</p>

Managing fear—the goal of exposure therapy—is a critical part of courage. The civil rights demonstrator and the bomb-disposal operator must be able to control their fears to be successful.</p>

But courage isn’t just suppressed fear. It’s also the knowledge of how to act in the moment.</p>

His workshops weren’t just about toughening up emotionally. They were about mental rehearsals.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,117
Participants had to anticipate how they would react to certain situations. In a sense, they were preloading a response so that, in the moment, they could act quickly without deliberation.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,119
The psychologist Peter Gollwitzer has studied the way this preloading affects our behavior. His research shows that when people make advance mental commitments—if X happens, then I will do Y—they are substantially more likely to act in support of their goals than people who lack those mental plans.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,123
Gollwitzer calls these plans “implementation intentions,”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,124
and often the trigger for the plan is as simple as a time and place: When I leave work today, I’m going to drive straight to the gym. The success rate is striking.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,125
Setting implementation intentions more than doubled the number of students who turned in a certain assignment on time; doubled the number of women who performed breast self-exams in a certain month; and cut by half the recovery time required by patients who had received hip or knee replacement (among many other examples). There is power in preloading a response.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,394
We laugh to tie the group together. Our laughter says, I’m with you. I’m part of your group.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,395
In groups, we are constantly assessing the reactions and feelings of the group. Our words and</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,395
glances are a kind of social sonar. Are you still there? Are you hearing what I’m hearing? Are your reactions like mine? Laughing in groups is another way of sending positive signals back and forth. We are synchronizing our reactions.</p>

Purpose is defined as the sense that you are contributing to others, that your work has broader meaning. Passion is the feeling of excitement or enthusiasm you have about your work.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,483
The outcome is clear. Purpose trumps passion. Graduation speakers take note: The best advice is not “Pursue your passion!” It’s “Pursue your purpose!”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,485
Passion is individualistic. It can energize us but also isolate us, because my passion isn’t yours. By contrast, purpose is something people can share. It can knit groups together.</p>

others? What, in short, is the “circuitry” of a successful relationship?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,642
Our relationships are stronger when we perceive that our partners are responsive to us.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,644
Responsiveness encompasses three things: Understanding: My partner knows how I see myself and what is important to me. Validation: My partner respects who I am and what I want. Caring: My partner takes active and supportive steps in helping me meet my needs.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,672
1. Do I know what is expected of me at work? 2. Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right? 3. Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day? 4. In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise for good work? (Validation.) 5. Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me as a person? (Caring.) 6. Is there someone at work who encourages my development? (Understanding. Caring.)</p>

Their relationship was utterly transformed because of a simple question: “What matters to you?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,725
As we saw with the Stanton home visits, with the right kind of moment, relationships can change in an instant.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,728
Responsiveness matters in the complex, emotional relationships between caregivers and patients, but it also plays a role in more mundane, day-to-day interactions.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,735
Why does the Internet have a photographic memory for ad clicks and amnesia about what we actually care about?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,736
What links these annoyances, of course, is the lack of understanding, validation, and caring.</p>

You are not special. You’re a number. Analysts at the Corporate Executive Board (CEB) studied customer service calls and the ratings that customers provided afterward. To the researchers’ surprise, only half of the customers’ ratings were attributable to the particular call they had just experienced. The other half reflected the way they had been treated previously.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,741
The CEB team called the customers’ memory of previous treatment their “baggage.” Most call center reps had the instinct to avoid the customer’s baggage.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,754
Baggage handling is responsive: It demonstrates understanding and validation of a customer’s frustrating past experience.</p>

In individual relationships, we believe that relationships grow closer with time. But that’s not the whole story. Sometimes long relationships reach plateaus. And with the right moment, relationships can deepen quickly.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,846
According to the psychologist Harry Reis, what deepens individual relationships is “responsiveness”: mutual understanding, validation, and caring.</p>

A bit of attention and energy can transform an ordinary moment into an extraordinary one.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,945
Our good intentions to create these moments are often frustrated by urgent-seeming problems and pressures.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,948
In the short term, we prioritize fixing problems over making moments, and that choice usually feels like a smart trade-off. But over time, it backfires.</p>

Acknowledge your strength. A bereaved parent said, “I can handle things better.

The 2008 debt crisis was another one of those like the one in 1982, which were both like many more before them and many more that will come. I enjoyed reflecting back on my painful mistakes and</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 87
a result, I tended to hire people who were the same way—who would dive right into challenges, figure out what to do about them, and then do it. I figured that if they had great character, common sense, and creativity, and were driven to achieve our shared mission, they would discover what it took to be successful if I gave them the freedom to figure out how to make the right decisions.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 87
But starting in the 1990s, I began to recognize the emotional barriers most people had to looking at their problems and weaknesses forthrightly. Rather than embracing ambiguous situations and difficult challenges, they tended to get uncomfortable when facing them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 87
But while almost all of us quickly agreed on the principles intellectually, many still struggled to convert what they had agreed to intellectually into effective action.</p>

This was because their habits and emotional barriers remained stronger than their reasoning.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 91
It seems to me that life consists of three phases. In the first, we are dependent on others and we learn. In the second, others depend on us and we work. And in the third and last, when others no longer depend on us and we no longer have to work, we are free to savor life. I was beginning my transition from my second to my third phase. Both intellectually and emotionally, I was no longer as excited about being successful as I was excited about having the people I cared about be successful without me.</p>

I realized that passing on knowledge is like passing on DNA—it is more important than the individual, because it lives way beyond the individual’s life. This is my attempt to help you succeed by passing along to you what I learned about how to struggle well—or, at the very least, to help you get the most out of each unit of effort you put in.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 134
My point is that people who create great things aren’t idle dreamers: They are totally grounded in reality.</p>

don’t. Some people want to change the world and others want to operate in simple harmony with it and savor life.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 135
Over time I learned that getting more out of life wasn’t just a matter of working harder at it. It was much more a matter of working effectively, because working effectively could increase my capacity by hundreds of times. I don’t care what you want or how hard you want to work for it. That’s for you to decide. I’m just trying to pass along to you what has helped me get the most out of each hour of time and each unit of effort.</p>

Most people have a tough time reflecting when they are in pain and they pay attention to other things when the</p>

pain passes, so they miss out on the reflections that provide the lessons. If you can reflect well while you’re in pain (which is probably too much to ask), great. But if you can remember to reflect after it passes, that’s valuable too. (I created a Pain Button app to help people do this, which I describe in the appendix.)</p>

As you climb above the blizzard of things that surrounds you, you will realize that they seem bigger than they really are when you are seeing them up close; that most things in life are just “another one of those.” The higher you ascend, the more effective you become at working with reality to shape outcomes toward your goals. What once seemed impossibly complex becomes simple.</p>

Watching people struggle and having others watch you struggle can elicit all kinds of ego-driven emotions such as sympathy, pity, embarrassment, anger, or defensiveness. You need to get over all that and stop seeing struggling as something negative. Most of life’s greatest opportunities come out of moments of struggle; it’s up to you to make the most of these tests of creativity and character.</p>

In addition to your ego barrier, you (and everyone else) also have blind spots—areas where your way of thinking prevents you from seeing things accurately.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 186
If you’re like most people, you have no clue how other people see things and aren’t good at seeking to understand what they are thinking, because you’re too preoccupied with telling them what you yourself think is correct.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 186
In other words, you are closed-minded; you presume too much. This closed-mindedness is terribly costly; it causes you to miss out on all sorts of wonderful possibilities and dangerous threats that other people might be showing you—and it blocks criticism that could be constructive and even lifesaving.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 187
Differences in thinking can be symbiotic and complementary instead of disruptive. For example, the lateral approach to thinking common among creative people can lead them to be unreliable, while more linear thinkers are often more dependable; some people are more emotional while others are more logical, and so on. None of these individuals would be able to succeed at any kind of complex project without the help of others who have complementary strengths.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 187
In my opinion, these two barriers—ego and blind spots—are the fatal flaws that keep intelligent, hardworking people from living up to their potential.</p>

Once I understood that it’s all physiological, many things became clearer to me. While I used to get angry and frustrated at people because of the choices they made, I came to realize that they weren’t intentionally acting in a way that seemed counterproductive; they were just living out things as they saw them, based on how their brains worked.</p>

For example, a highly creative, goal-oriented person good at imagining new ideas might undervalue the minutiae of daily life, which is also important; he might be so driven in his pursuit of long-term goals that he might have disdain for people who focus on the details of daily life. Similarly, a task-oriented person who is great with details might undervalue creativity—and worse still, may squelch it in the interests of efficiency.</p>

If you do just about anything frequently enough over time, you will form a habit that will control you. Good habits are those that get you to do what your “upper-level you” wants, and bad habits are those that are controlled by your “lower-level you” and stand in the way of your getting what your “upper-level you” wants. You can create a better set of habits if you understand how this part of your brain works.</p>

Our experience has been that left-brained folks tend to see right-brained folks as “spacey” or “abstract,” while right-brained thinkers tend to find left-brained thinkers “literal” or “narrow.” I have seen wonderful results occur when people know where their own and others’ inclinations lie, realize that both ways of thinking are invaluable, and assign responsibilities accordingly.</p>

We can all learn new facts and skills, but can we also learn to change how we are inclined to think? The answer is a qualified yes.</p>

Planning vs. perceiving. Some people like to live in a planned, orderly way and others prefer flexibility and spontaneity.35 Planners (or “Judgers” in Myers-Briggs terms) like to focus on a plan and stick with it, while perceivers are prone to focus on what’s happening around them and adapt to it. Perceivers work from the outside in; they see things happening and work backward to understand the cause and how to respond; they also see many possibilities that they compare and choose from—often so many that they are confused by them. In contrast, planners work from the inside out, first figuring out what they want to achieve and then how things should unfold. Planners and perceivers have trouble appreciating each other. Perceivers see new things and change direction often. This is discomforting to planners, who weigh precedent much more heavily in their decision making, and assume if it was done in a certain way before, it should be done in the same way again. Similarly, planners can discomfort perceivers by being seemingly rigid and slow to adapt.</p>

Practical Thinker + Determined. I’ve found that shapers tend to share attributes such as intense curiosity and a compulsive need to make sense of things, independent thinking that verges on rebelliousness, a need to dream big and unconventionally, a practicality and determination to push through all obstacles to achieve their goals, and a knowledge of their own and others’ weaknesses and strengths so they can orchestrate teams to achieve them. Perhaps even more importantly, they can hold conflicting thoughts simultaneously and look at them from different angles. They typically love to knock things around with other really smart people and can easily navigate back and forth between the big picture and the granular details, counting both as equally important.</p>

a high level, we look for people who think independently, argue open-mindedly and assertively, and above all else value the intense pursuit of truth and excellence, and through it, the rapid improvement of themselves and the organization. Because we treat work as more than just what we do to make a living, we look at every potential hire not just as an employee but as someone we’d want share our lives with. We insist that the people we work with are considerate and have a high sense of personal accountability to do the difficult, right things. We look for people with generous natures and high standards of fairness. Most important, they must be able to put their egos aside and assess themselves candidly.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 407
a. Think through which values, abilities, and skills you are looking for (in that order). Values are the deep-seated beliefs that motivate behaviors and determine people’s compatibilities with each other. People will fight for their values, and they are likely to fight with people who don’t share them. Abilities are ways of thinking and behaving. Some people are great learners and fast processors; others</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 407
possess the ability to see things at a higher level. Some focus more on the particulars; still others think creatively or logically or with supreme organization. Skills are learned tools, such as being able to speak a foreign</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 407

Since at Bridgewater the key shared values that maintain our culture are meaningful work and meaningful relationships, radical truth and radical transparency, an open-minded willingness to explore harsh realities including one’s own weaknesses, a sense of ownership, a drive for excellence, and the willingness to do the good but difficult things, we look for highly capable people who deeply want all of those things.</p>

Had I explained myself better when we sat down that second time, he could have put my comment into perspective.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 426
Think about accuracy, not implications. It’s often the case that someone receiving critical feedback gets preoccupied with the implications of that feedback instead of whether it’s true. This is a mistake. As I’ll explain later, conflating the “what is” with the “what to do about it” typically leads to bad decision making.</p>

Your assessment of how Responsible Parties are performing should be based not on whether they’re doing it your way but on whether they’re doing it in a good way.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 427
Learn from success as well as from failure. Radical truth doesn’t require you to be negative all the time. Point out examples of jobs done well and the causes of their success. This reinforces the actions that led to the results and creates role models for those who are learning.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 427
The greatest gift you can give someone is the power to be successful. Giving people the opportunity to struggle rather than giving them the things they are struggling for will make them stronger.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 428
Compliments are easy to give but they don’t help people stretch.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 428
While it is important to be clear to people about what they are doing well, it is even more important to point out their weaknesses and have them reflect on them.</p>

Build your synthesis from the specifics up. By synthesizing, I mean converting a lot of data into an accurate picture.</p>

Put things in perspective by reminding them that their pain is the pain that comes with learning and personal evolution—and that knowing the truth will put them on the path to a much better place.</p>

Knowing how people operate and being able to judge whether that way of operating will lead to good results is more important than knowing what they did. Knowing what people are like is the best indicator of how well they are likely to handle their responsibilities in the future. At Bridgewater, we call this “paying more attention to the swing than the shot.” Since good and bad outcomes can arise from circumstances that might not have had anything to do with how the individual handled the situation, it is preferable to assess people based on both their reasoning and their outcomes.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 435
Doing this has taught me a lot about how to assess others’ logic, and how to have better logic myself.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 436
Abilities, especially right-brained abilities, are more difficult to assess. When thinking about why someone is a poor performer, openly consider whether it is a problem with their abilities.</p>

skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 77
According to Gallagher, decades of research contradict this understanding. Our brains instead construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 77
As Gallagher summarizes: “Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of what you focus on.”</p>

After a bad or disrupting occurrence in your life, Fredrickson’s research shows, what you choose to focus on exerts significant leverage on your attitude going forward.</p>

These e-mails provide a nice case study of the type of shallow concerns that vie for your attention in a knowledge work setting.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 81
“Five years of reporting on attention have confirmed some home truths,” Gallagher reports. “[Among them is the notion that] ‘the idle mind is the devil’s workshop’ … when you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what’s right.” A workday driven by the shallow, from a</p>

Kelly published a book, All Things Shining, which explores how notions of sacredness and meaning have evolved throughout the history of human culture. They set out to reconstruct this history because they’re worried about its endpoint in our current era. “The world used to be, in its various forms, a world of sacred, shining things,” Dreyfus and Kelly explain early in the book. “The shining things now seem far away.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 88
they conclude, “is not to generate meaning, but rather to cultivate in himself the skill of discerning the meanings that are already there.”</p>

The third point responds to the difficulty of designing optimal solutions while under pressure. Trying to decide in the presence of an adversary narrows your vision. Having a lot at stake inhibits creativity. So does searching for the one right solution.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 444
Before trying to reach agreement, invent options for mutual gain.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 446
However, you can counter such a negotiator by insisting that his single say-so is not enough and that the agreement must reflect some fair standard independent of the naked will of either side.</p>

The ability to see the situation as the other side sees it, as difficult as it may be, is one of the most important skills a negotiator can possess.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 594
Don’t deduce their intentions from your fears.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 631
Give them a stake in the outcome by making sure they participate in the process.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 635
If you want the other side to accept a disagreeable conclusion, it is crucial that you involve them in the process of reaching that conclusion.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 686
Pay attention to “core concerns.” Many emotions in negotiation are driven by a core set of five interests: autonomy, the desire to make your own choices and control your own fate; appreciation, the desire to be recognized and valued; affiliation, the desire to belong as an accepted member of some peer group; role, the desire to have a meaningful purpose; and status, the desire to feel fairly seen and acknowledged.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 692
we apply our general tendency toward either-or thinking to our self-perception: “I am a kind person.” “I’m a good manager.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 696
If you find a counterpart’s behavior oddly out of character or feel as if you have unexpectedly stepped on a land mine in your conversation, think about whether they might be experiencing a threat to their identity from something you have said or might say.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 698
if you find yourself feeling off-balance and emotional, ask yourself if your sense of identity feels threatened.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 703
Making your feelings or theirs an explicit focus of discussion will not only underscore the seriousness of the problem, it will also make the negotiations less reactive and more “pro-active.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 707
People obtain psychological release through the simple process of recounting their grievances to an attentive audience.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 729
An apology may be one of the least costly and most rewarding investments you can make.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 759
“Did I understand correctly that you are saying that …?” the other side will realize that they are not just killing time, not just going through a routine. They will also feel the satisfaction of being heard and understood. It has been said that the cheapest concession you can make to the other side is to let them know they have been heard.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 762
to pay close attention to what is said, to ask the other party to spell out carefully and clearly exactly what they mean, and to request that ideas be repeated if there is any ambiguity or uncertainty.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 765
Many consider it a good tactic not to give the other side’s case too much attention, and not to admit any legitimacy in their point of view. A good negotiator does just the reverse. Unless you acknowledge what they are saying and demonstrate that you understand them, they may believe you have not heard them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 770
“Let me see whether I follow what you are telling me. From your point of view, the situation looks like this. …”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 771
As you repeat what you understood them to have said, phrase it positively from their point of view, making the strength of their case clear.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 772
You might say, “You have a strong case.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 773
Here’s the way it strikes me.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 774
But unless you can convince them that you do grasp how they see it, you may be unable to get them to hear when you explain your viewpoint to them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 776
If you can put their case better than they can, and then refute it, you maximize the chance of initiating a constructive dialogue on the merits and minimize the chance of their believing you have misunderstood them.</p>

“Open covenants privately arrived at.” No matter how many people are involved in a negotiation, important decisions are typically made when no more than two people are in the room.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 790
Speak about yourself, not about them. In many negotiations, each side explains and condemns at great length the motivations and intentions of the other side. It is more persuasive, however, to describe a problem in terms of its impact on you than in terms of what they did or why: “I feel let down” instead of “You broke your word.” “We feel discriminated against” rather than “You’re a racist.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 795

“To get some fresh air.” She asks the other why he wants it closed: “To avoid the draft.”</p>

For a wise solution reconcile interests, not positions This story is typical of many negotiations. Since the parties’ problem appears to be a conflict of positions, and since their goal is to agree on a position, they naturally tend to think and talk about positions—and in the process often reach an impasse.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 853
Interests define the problem. The basic problem in a negotiation lies not in conflicting positions, but in the conflict between each side’s needs, desires, concerns, and fears. The parties may say:</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 861
the hubbub of positions.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 874
Reconciling interests rather than positions works for two reasons. First, for every interest there usually exist several possible positions that could satisfy</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 876
When you do look behind opposed positions for the motivating interests, you can often find an alternative position that meets not only your interests but theirs as well. In the Sinai, demilitarization was one such alternative.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 878
Reconciling interests rather than compromising between positions also works because behind opposed positions lie many more interests than conflicting ones.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 879
Behind opposed positions lie shared and compatible interests, as well as conflicting ones.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 880
We tend to assume that because the other side’s positions are opposed to ours, their interests must also be opposed. If we have an interest in defending ourselves, then they must want to attack us. If we have an interest in minimizing the rent, then their interest must be to maximize it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 882
reveal the existence of many more interests that are shared or compatible than ones that are opposed.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 984
The purpose of negotiating is to serve your interests. The chance of that happening increases when you communicate them. The other side may not know what your interests are, and you may not know theirs.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 992
Make your interests come alive. If you go with a raging ulcer to see a doctor, you should not hope for much relief if you describe it as a mild stomachache. It is your job to have the other side understand exactly how important and legitimate your interests are.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 998
Inviting the other side to “correct me if I’m wrong” shows your openness, and if they do not correct you, it implies that they accept your description of the situation.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,005
People listen better if they feel that you have understood them. They tend to think that those who understand them are intelligent and sympathetic people whose own opinions may be worth listening to.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,013
Put the problem before your answer.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,015
you do, you can be quite certain that the representatives will not be listening to the reasons. They have heard your position and are no doubt busy preparing arguments against it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,018
If you want someone to listen and understand your reasoning, give your interests and reasoning first and your conclusions or proposals later.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,030
The question “Why?” has two quite different meanings.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,031
The other looks forward for a purpose and treats our behavior as subject to our free will.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,064
One useful rule of thumb is to give positive support to the human beings on the other side equal in strength to the vigor with which you emphasize the problem. This combination of support and attack may seem inconsistent. Psychologically, it is; the inconsistency helps make it work. A well-known theory of psychology, the theory of cognitive dissonance, holds that people dislike inconsistency and will act to eliminate it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,070
Fighting hard on the substantive issues increases the pressure for an effective solution; giving support to the human beings on the other side tends to improve your relationship and to increase the likelihood of reaching agreement. It is the combination of support and attack that works; either alone is likely to be insufficient.</p>

Often you are negotiating along a single dimension,</p>

He expands the pie before dividing it. Skill at inventing options is one of the most useful assets a negotiator can have.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,088
Yet all too often negotiators end up like the proverbial children who quarreled over an orange. After they finally agreed to divide the orange in half, the first child took one half, ate the fruit, and threw away the peel, while the other threw away the fruit and used the peel from the second half in baking a cake. All too often negotiators “leave money on the table” — they fail to reach agreement when they might have, or the agreement they do reach could have been better for each side. Too many negotiations end up with half an orange for each side instead of the whole fruit for one and the whole peel for the other. Why?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,093
As valuable as it is to have many options, people involved in a negotiation rarely sense a need for them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,095
All available answers appear to lie along a straight line between their position and yours. Often the only creative thinking shown is to suggest splitting the difference.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,097
In most negotiations there are four major obstacles that inhibit the inventing of an abundance of options: (1) premature judgment; (2) searching for the single answer; (3) the assumption of a fixed pie; and (4) thinking that “solving their problem is their problem.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,100
Inventing options does not come naturally. Not inventing is the normal state of affairs,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,105
Nothing is so harmful to inventing as a critical sense waiting to pounce on the drawbacks of any new idea. Judgment hinders imagination.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,107
Practical negotiation appears to call for practical thinking, not wild ideas.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,107
Your creativity may be even more stifled by the presence of those on the other side.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,122
If the first impediment to creative thinking is premature criticism, the second is premature closure.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,136
separate the act of inventing options from the act of judging them; (2) broaden the options on the table rather than look for a single answer; (3) search for mutual gains; and (4) invent ways of making their decisions easy.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,140
Invent first, decide later.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,144
A brainstorming session is designed to produce as many ideas as possible to solve the problem at hand. The key ground rule is to postpone all criticism and evaluation of ideas.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,146
With those inhibitions removed, one idea should stimulate another, like firecrackers setting off one another.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,155
The more different a brainstorming session seems from a normal meeting, the easier it is for participants to suspend judgment.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,157
Design an informal atmosphere.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,159
Choose a facilitator. Someone at the meeting needs to facilitate—to keep the meeting on track,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,162
Seat the participants side by side facing the problem. The physical reinforces the psychological.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,162
Physically sitting side by side can reinforce the mental attitude of tackling a common problem together.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,165
2. Clarify the ground rules, including the no-criticism rule.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,168
If ideas are shot down unless they appeal to all participants, the implicit goal becomes to advance an idea that no one will shoot down. If, on the other hand, wild ideas are encouraged, even those that in fact lie well outside the realm of the possible, the group may generate from these ideas other options that are possible and that no one would previously have considered.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,171
to make the entire session off the record and</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,172
3. Brainstorm. Once the purpose of the meeting is clear, let your imaginations go.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,174
Record the ideas in full view. Recording ideas either on a whiteboard or flipcharts gives the group a tangible sense of collective achievement; it reinforces the no-criticism rule; it reduces the tendency to repeat; and it helps stimulate other ideas.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,176
After brainstorming:</p>
<p>Note:make a brainstorming procedure</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,177
Star the most promising ideas.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,179
Invent improvements for promising ideas.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,181
“What I like best about that idea is. … Might it be even better if …?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,192
To reduce the risk of appearing committed to any given idea, you can make a habit of advancing at least two alternatives at the same time.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,193
You can also put on the table options with which you obviously disagree. “I could give you the house for nothing, or you could pay me a million dollars in cash for it, or. …” Since you are plainly not proposing either of these ideas, the ones that follow are labeled as mere possibilities, not proposals.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,224
But whether you brainstorm together or not, separating the act of developing options from the act of deciding on them is extremely useful in any negotiation.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,225
Discussing options differs radically from taking positions. Whereas one side’s position will conflict with another’s, options invite other options. The very language you use differs. It consists of questions, not assertions; it is open, not closed: “One option is. … What other options have you thought of?” “What if we agreed to this?” “How about doing it this way?” “How would this work?” “What would be wrong with that?” Invent before you decide.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,230
Even with the best of intentions, participants in a brainstorming session are likely to operate on the assumption that they are really looking for the one best answer,</p>

The key to wise decision-making, whether in wine-making, sports, or negotiation, lies in selecting from a great number and variety of options.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,241
A brainstorming session frees people to think creatively. Once freed, they need ways to think about their problems and to generate constructive solutions.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,243
The task of inventing options involves four types of thinking.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,273
Look through the eyes of different experts. Another way to generate multiple options is to examine your problem from the perspective of different professions and disciplines.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,307
Look for mutual gain</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,308
The third major block to creative problem-solving lies in the assumption of a fixed pie: the less for you, the more for me.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,311
Even apart from a shared interest in averting joint loss, there almost always exists the possibility of joint gain.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,313
Identify shared interests. In theory it is obvious that shared interests help produce agreement.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,331
a joint publicity campaign with the Chamber of Commerce to attract new companies, a reduction in taxes for existing industries that choose to expand.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,340
Three points about shared interests are worth remembering. First, shared interests lie latent in every negotiation.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,341
Ask yourself: Do we have a shared interest in preserving our relationship? What opportunities lie ahead for cooperation and mutual benefit? What costs would we bear if negotiations broke off? Are there common principles, like a fair price, that we both can respect?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,344
Second, shared interests are opportunities, not godsends. To be of use, you need to make something out of them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,344
It helps to make a shared interest explicit and to formulate it as a shared goal. In other words, make it concrete and future-oriented.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,346
The tax holiday for new industries would then represent not a concession by the mayor to you but an action in pursuit of your shared goal.</p>
<p>Note:present what they give off as an action to reach their goal not as concession or lose</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,348
stressing your shared interests can make the negotiation smoother and more amicable.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,350
Dovetail differing interests.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,352
In this case as in many others, a satisfactory agreement is made possible because each side wants different things.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,353
People generally assume that differences between two parties create the problem. Yet differences can also lead to a solution.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,354
Agreement is often based on disagreement. It is as absurd to think, for example, that you should always begin by reaching agreement on the facts as it is for a</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,358
Many creative agreements reflect this principle of reaching agreement through differences. Differences in interests and belief make it possible for an item to be of high benefit to you, yet low cost to the other side. Consider the nursery rhyme:</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,391
Look for items that are of low cost to you and high benefit to them, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,396
Impressed with the merits of their own case, people usually pay too little attention to ways of advancing their case by taking care of interests on the other side.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,411
Your task is to give them not a problem but an answer, to give them not a tough decision but an easy one. It is crucial in that process to focus your attention on the content of the decision itself. That decision is often impeded by uncertainty.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,431
Search for it. Look for a decision or statement that the other side may have made in a similar situation,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,432
provides an objective standard for your request and makes it easier for them to go along. Recognizing their probable desire to be consistent, thinking about what they have already done or said will help you generate options acceptable to you that also take their point of view into account.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,437
We often try to influence others by threats and warnings of what will happen if they do not decide as we would like. Offers are usually more effective.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,438
Concentrate both on making them aware of the consequences they can expect if they do decide as you wish and on improving those consequences from their point of view.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,439
How can you make your offers more credible?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,440
What can you invent that might be attractive to them but low in cost to yourself?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,446
Try to draft a proposal to which their responding with the single word “yes” would be sufficient, realistic, and operational.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,450
Therefore, generate many options before selecting among them. Invent first; decide later.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,464
As discussed in Chapter 1, trying to reconcile differences on the basis of will has serious costs. No</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,467
If trying to settle differences of interest on the basis of will has such high costs, the solution is to negotiate on some basis independent of the will of either side—that is, on the basis of objective criteria.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,481
In short, the approach is to commit yourself to reaching a solution based on principle, not pressure. Concentrate on the merits of the problem, not the mettle of the parties. Be open to reason, but closed to threats.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,513
Carrying on a principled negotiation involves two questions: How do you develop objective criteria,</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,560
Professional baseball, for example, uses “last-best-offer arbitration” to settle player salary disputes.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,562
pressure on the parties to make their proposals more reasonable.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,568
Frame each issue as a joint search for objective criteria.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,569
Reason and be open to reason as to which standards are most appropriate and how they should be applied.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,570
Never yield to pressure, only to principle.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,571
In short, focus on objective criteria firmly but flexibly.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,574
other side may have conflicting interests, but the two of you now have a shared goal: to determine a fair price.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,577
Ask “What’s your theory?” If the seller starts by giving you a position, such as “The price is $255,000,” ask for the theory behind that price: “How did you arrive at that figure?” Treat the problem as though the seller too is looking for a fair price based on objective criteria.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,580
Agree first on principles.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,581
Each standard the other side proposes becomes a lever you can then use to persuade them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,581
Your case will have more impact if it is presented in terms of their</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,582
criteria, and they will find it difficult to resist applying their criteria to the problem.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,583
Your theory is that this house should be sold for what comparable houses in the neighborhood are going for, am I right?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,586
the standard, their deferring to it is not an act of weakness but an act of strength, of carrying out their word.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,588
mind. In most negotiations, people use precedent and other objective standards simply as arguments in support of a position.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,594
This is emphatically not what is meant by principled negotiation. Insisting that an agreement be based on objective criteria does not mean insisting that it be based solely on the criterion you advance.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,597
you should be willing to respond to reasons for applying another standard or for applying a standard differently. When each party is advancing a different standard, look for an objective basis for deciding between them, such as which standard has been used by the parties in the past or which standard is more widely applied.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,604
you might suggest putting them to a test. Agree on someone you both regard as fair and give him or her a list of the proposed criteria.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,608
The difference between seeking agreement on the appropriate principles for deciding a matter and using principles simply as arguments to support positions is sometimes subtle, but always significant.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,610
A principled negotiator is open to reasoned persuasion on the merits; a positional bargainer is not.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,610
It is the combination of openness to reason with insistence on a solution based on objective criteria that makes principled negotiation so persuasive</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,612
Never yield to pressure.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,613
hire your brother-in-law on the condition that you give in on the depth of the foundations? You would probably answer, “A job for my brother-in-law has nothing to do with whether the house will be safely supported on a foundation of that depth.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,615
“We’ll settle that question on the merits too.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,616
Let’s see what other contractors charge for this kind of work,”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,616
“Bring me your cost figures and we’ll work out a fair profit margin.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,617
“Trust is an entirely separate matter. The issue is how deep the foundations have to be to make the house safe.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,619
Pressure can take many forms: a bribe, a threat, a manipulative appeal to trust, or a simple refusal to budge. In all these cases, the principled response is the same: invite them to state their reasoning, suggest objective criteria you think apply, and refuse to budge except on this basis. Never yield to pressure, only to principle.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,627
principled negotiation is a dominant strategy over positional bargaining.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,630
Principle serves as your hardhearted partner who will not let you yield to pressure. It is a form of “right makes might.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,639
Shifting discussion in a negotiation from the question of what the other side is willing to do to the question of how the matter ought to be decided does not end argument, nor does it guarantee a favorable result. It does, however, provide a strategy you can vigorously pursue without the high costs of positional bargaining.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,667
When you are trying to catch an airplane your goal may seem tremendously important; looking back on it, you see you could have caught the next plane. Negotiation will often present you with a similar situation.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,671
The siren song of “Let’s all agree and put an end to this” becomes persuasive. You may end up with a deal you should have rejected.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,676
Having a bottom line makes it easier to resist pressure and temptations of the moment.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,684
But the protection afforded by adopting a bottom line involves high costs. It limits your ability to benefit from what you learn during negotiation. By definition, a bottom line is a position that is not to be changed.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,686
A bottom line also inhibits imagination. It reduces the incentive to invent a tailor-made solution that would reconcile differing interests in a way more advantageous for both you and them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,691
this. A bottom line—by its very nature rigid—is almost certain to be too rigid.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,699
Is there an alternative to the bottom line? Is there a measure for agreements that will protect you against both accepting an agreement you should reject and rejecting an agreement you should accept? There is.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,708
The reason you negotiate is to produce something better than the results you can obtain without negotiating.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,709
What is your BATNA—your Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement? That is the standard against which any proposed agreement should be measured.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,714
If you have not thought carefully about what you will do if you fail to reach an agreement, you are negotiating with your eyes closed.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,718
One frequent mistake is psychologically to see your alternatives in the aggregate. You may be telling yourself that if you do not reach agreement on a salary for this job, you could always go to California, or go south, or go back to school, or write, or work on a farm, or live in Paris, or do something else. In your mind you are likely to find the sum of these alternatives more attractive than working for a specific salary in a particular job.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,722
you fail to reach agreement, you will have to choose just one.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,723
In most circumstances, however, the greater danger is that you are too committed to reaching agreement. Not having developed any alternative to a negotiated solution, you are unduly pessimistic about what would happen if negotiations broke off.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,727
You may think to yourself, “Let’s negotiate first and see what happens. If things don’t work out, then I’ll figure out what to do.” But having at least a tentative answer to the question is absolutely essential if you are to conduct your negotiations wisely.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,732
it is useful to identify one far from perfect agreement that is better than your BATNA.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,741
In fact, the relative negotiating power of two parties depends primarily upon how attractive to each is the option of not reaching agreement.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,745
The tourist may be wealthy and “powerful,” but in this negotiation he will be weak indeed unless he knows approximately how much it would cost and how difficult it would be to find a comparable pot elsewhere.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,749
Think for a moment about how you would feel walking into a job interview with no other job offers—only some uncertain leads. Think how the talk about salary would go. Now contrast that with how you would feel walking in with two other job offers. How would that salary negotiation proceed? The difference is power.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,760
because they were not converted into a good BATNA, proved of little use. Having an attractive BATNA, the small town had more ability to affect the outcome of the negotiation than did one of the world’s largest corporations.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,763
Vigorous exploration of what you will do if you do not reach agreement can greatly strengthen your hand. Attractive alternatives are not just sitting there waiting for you; you usually have to develop them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,764
(1) inventing a list of actions you might conceivably take if no agreement is reached; (2) improving some of the more promising ideas and converting them into practical alternatives; and (3) selecting, tentatively, the one alternative that seems best.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,770
The second stage is to improve the best of your ideas and turn the most promising into real alternatives.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,777
Having gone through this effort, you now have a BATNA.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,777
Judge every offer against it. The better your BATNA, the greater your ability to improve the terms of any negotiated agreement.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,779
It is easier to break off negotiations if you know where you’re going. The</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,780
greater your willingness to break off negotiations, the more forcefully you can present your interests and the basis on which you believe an agreement should be reached.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,783
If they think you lack a good alternative when in fact you have one, then you should almost certainly let them know.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,789
reached. Perhaps they have a vague notion that they have a great many alternatives and are under the influence of their cumulative total.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,789
they appear to overestimate their BATNA, you will want to help them think through whether their expectations are realistic.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,803
Apply knowledge, time, money, people, connections, and wits into devising the best solution for you independent of the other side’s assent.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,804
The more easily and happily you can walk away from a negotiation, the greater your capacity to affect its outcome.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,806
Developing your BATNA is perhaps the most effective course of action you can take in dealing with a seemingly more powerful negotiator.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,826
If the other side announces a firm position, you may be tempted to criticize and reject it. If they criticize your proposal, you may be tempted to defend it and dig yourself in.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,827
If they attack you, you may be tempted to defend yourself and counterattack. In short, if they push you hard, you will tend to push back.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,834
Break the vicious cycle by refusing to react. Instead of pushing back, sidestep their attack and deflect it against the problem.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,836
Rather than resisting their force, channel it into exploring interests, inventing options for mutual gain, and searching for independent standards.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,847
ask them how they think it addresses the problem at hand. Treat their position as one option and objectively examine the extent to which</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,871
Examine their negative judgments to find out their underlying interests and to improve your ideas from their point of view.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,876
turn the situation around and ask for their advice. Ask them what they would do if they were in your position.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,882
Recast an attack on you as an attack on the problem. When the other side attacks you personally — as frequently happens — resist the temptation to defend yourself or to attack them. Instead, sit back and allow them to let off steam.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,883
Listen to them, show you understand what they are saying,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,887
Ask questions and pause. Those engaged in negotiation jujitsu use two key tools. The first is to use questions instead of statements.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,888
Statements generate resistance, whereas questions generate answers.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,893
Silence is one of your best weapons. Use it. If they have made an unreasonable proposal or an attack you regard as unjustified, the best thing to do may be to sit there and not say a word.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,894
If you have asked an honest question to which they have provided an insufficient answer, just wait. People tend to feel uncomfortable with silence, particularly if they have doubts about the merits of something they have said.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,899
Silence often creates the impression of a stalemate that the other side will feel impelled to break by answering your question or coming up with a new suggestion.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,900
When you ask questions, pause. Don’t take them off the hook by going right on with another question or some comment of your own. Some of the most effective negotiating you will ever do is when you are not talking.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,967
that a camel is a horse designed by a committee.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,973
Note that in most situations you do not have to get anyone’s consent to start using the one-text procedure.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,974
Simply prepare a draft and ask for criticism.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,992
The essence of principled negotiation lies in remaining open to persuasion by objective facts and principles.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,000
Making yourself open to correction and persuasion is a pillar in the strategy of principled negotiation. You can convince the other side to be open to the principles and objective standards you suggest only if you show yourself open to the ones they suggest.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,002
“We appreciate what you’ve done for us”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,007
“We have nothing against you personally. We think you’re a generous person.” He puts himself on her side. He defuses any threat she may feel to her self-image.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,008
Praise and support, moreover, imply that the person will continue to deserve them. After being praised, Mrs. Jones now has a slight emotional investment in Turnbull’s approval of her.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,011
“Our concern is fairness”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,014
Turnbull takes a basic stand on principle and announces his intention to stick to it;</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,015
he must be persuaded on the basis of principle. At the same time, he lets Mrs. Jones know he is open to persuasion along the lines of this principle. She is thus left with little choice but to reason with him in pursuit of her interests.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,018
His ends, he claims, are a fair balance between rent paid and time spent.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,020
“We would like to settle this on the basis of independent standards, not of who can do what to whom”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,035
But instead of reacting, Turnbull keeps his temper and brings the negotiation back to the merits. This is a good example of negotiation jujitsu. He deflects Mrs. Jones’s attack by taking responsibility for her mistaken perceptions, and he tries to persuade her of his sincere interest in principle.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,037
He does not hide either his selfish interests or his leverage over her; on the contrary, he makes both explicit. Once they are acknowledged, he can distinguish them from the merits and they can cease being an issue.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,047
however, by expressing his gratitude once more and then defining the question of trust as irrelevant. Turnbull at once reaffirms his appreciation of Mrs. Jones while he remains firm on the principle. In doing so, he avoids connecting the two thoughts with “but,” implicitly using “and” instead. “But,” sometimes called the “great eraser,” has a tendency to negate the first thing you say by implying that only one of two statements can be true, making it either/or. “And” underscores the more complex reality that both thoughts can be true at the same time.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,065
Analysis. Statements of fact can feel lecturing or threatening. Whenever you can, ask a question instead.</p>
<p>Note:important</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,069
Phrasing each piece of information as a question allows Mrs. Jones to participate, listen to the information, evaluate it, and either accept or correct it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,070
Turnbull communicates the same information to her but in a less provocative manner. He reduces the heat still further by attributing a particularly pointed question to his absent roommate.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,076
A principled negotiator neither accepts nor rejects the other side’s positions.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,076
To keep the dialogue focused on the merits, Turnbull questions Mrs. Jones about the reasons for her position. He does not ask whether there were any reasons. He assumes there are good reasons. This flattering assumption leads the other side to search for reasons even if there are none, thus keeping the negotiation on the basis of principle.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,086
Analysis. Principled negotiation requires good communication. Before responding to Mrs. Jones’s arguments, Turnbull restates to her in positive terms what he has heard to make sure he has indeed understood her.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,087
Once she feels understood, she can relax and discuss the problem constructively.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,088
She can’t dismiss his arguments on the grounds that they do not take into account what she knows. She is more likely to listen now and be more receptive. In trying to sum up her point of view, Turnbull establishes a cooperative game in which both are making sure he understands the facts.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,093
Analysis. A good negotiator rarely makes an important decision on the spot. The psychological pressure to be nice and to give in is too great. A little time and distance help disentangle the people from the problem.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,097
He shows not only decisiveness but also control over the course of the negotiation.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,103
Turnbull: Let me show you where I have trouble following some of your reasons for the extra $268 a month.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,108
Analysis. In principled negotiation you present your reasons first before offering a proposal. If principles come afterward, they appear not as the objective criteria that any proposal should satisfy but as mere justifications for an arbitrary position.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,110
For Turnbull to explain his reasons first shows his openness to persuasion and his awareness of the need to convince Mrs. Jones. If he announced his proposal first, Mrs. Jones probably would not bother to listen to the reasons that followed. Her mind would be elsewhere, considering what objections and counterproposals she could make.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,114
In preparing for your negotiation, it helps to think about what standards would be useful, who might be able to provide them, and how to frame your questions to elicit the most relevant information.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,116
“One fair solution might be …”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,120
Analysis. Turnbull presents a proposal not as his, but as a fair option that deserves their joint consideration.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,120
He does not claim it is the only fair solution, but one fair solution. He is specific without digging himself into a position and inviting rejection.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,127
Turnbull is trying to make it easy for Mrs. Jones to say yes to his proposal. So he starts by making it clear that all it takes for the problem to go away is Mrs. Jones’s agreement.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,130
without upsetting the negotiations? He bases the alternative on objective principle by attributing it to a legal authority—the hearing examiner.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,131
He distances himself personally from the suggestion.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,144
Incorporating her interests into the agreement not only gives her more of a stake in it but also allows Mrs. Jones to save face.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,148
Paul and I do appreciate, Mrs. Jones, all that you’ve done for us, and I’m pleased that we’ve settled this last problem fairly and amicably.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,194
Don’t attack people personally for using a tactic you consider illegitimate. If they get defensive it may be more difficult for them to give up the tactic, and they may be left with a residue of anger that will fester and interfere with other issues.</p>

Don’t be diverted from the negotiation by the urge to teach them a lesson.</p>

expected. In contrast, looking behind positions for interests, inventing options for mutual gain, and finding and using objective criteria take hard work and, when the other side seems recalcitrant, emotional restraint and maturity.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,461
How complex are the issues? The more complex the subject matter, the more unwise it is to engage in positional bargaining. Complexity calls for careful analysis of interests that are shared or that can be creatively dovetailed, and then for brainstorming.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,463
How important is it to maintain a good working relationship? If the other side is a valued customer or client, maintaining your ongoing relationship may be more important to you than the outcome of any one deal. This does not mean you should be less persistent in pursuing your interests, but it does suggest avoiding tactics such as threats or ultimatums that involve a high</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,482
Bargaining over positions does the least harm if it comes after you have identified each other’s interests, invented options for mutual gain, and discussed relevant standards of fairness.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,486
Yet using external standards improves on haggling in three ways: An outcome informed even by conflicting standards of fairness and community practice is likely to be wiser than an arbitrary result.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,506
Using external standards often helps narrow the range of disagreement and may help expand the area of potential agreement.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,527
Many negotiators are overly optimistic in assuming that they are more clever than their counterparts.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,548
The human propensity for defensive and reactive behavior is one reason so many negotiations fail when agreement would otherwise make sense.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,551
The more seriously you disagree with someone, the more important it is that you be able to deal well with that disagreement.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,561
Rather, substantive issues need to be disentangled from relationship and process issues. The content of a possible agreement needs to be separated from questions of how you talk about it and how you deal with the other side. Each set of issues needs to be negotiated on its own merits. The following list illustrates the distinction: Substantive Issues Terms Conditions Prices Dates Numbers Liabilities Relationship Issues Balance of emotion and reason Ease of communication Degree of trust and reliability Attitude of acceptance (or rejection) Relative emphasis on persuasion (or coercion) Degree of mutual understanding People often assume that there is a trade-off between pursuing a good substantive outcome and pursuing a good relationship. We disagree. A good working relationship tends to make it easier to get good substantive outcomes (for both sides). Good substantive outcomes tend to make a good relationship even better.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,575
Our point is that you should not give in for the purpose of trying to improve a relationship.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,587
Our behavior should be designed to model and encourage the behavior we would prefer and to avoid any reward for the behavior we dislike, both without compromising our substantive interests.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,600
It is the perception that is skewed, not the response to that perception.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,601
On the other hand, if you inquire empathetically, taking their feelings seriously and trying to trace their reasoning to its roots, it is sometimes possible to effect change.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,603
Working with them, you may discover a logical leap, a factual misperception, or a traumatic association from an earlier time that, once brought to light, can be examined and modified by the people themselves.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,604
In essence, you are looking for the psychological interests behind their position, to help them find a way to meet more of their interests more effectively.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,656
A key point, worth repeating, is that negotiating does not require compromising your principles. More often success is achieved by finding a solution that is arguably consistent with each side’s principles.</p>

“One of the hardest challenges is to hire people from outside the company.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 5
What is a resume? It is a record of a person’s career with all of the accomplishments embellished and all the failures removed.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 6
“Look, I hired your resume. But unfortunately, what I got was you!”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 6
“Otherwise smart people struggle to hire strangers.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 7
managers cling to their favorite methods even when evidence suggests they don’t work.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 7
Forgers can pass off fake paintings as real ones to the time-pressed buyer, and people who want a job badly enough can fake an interview if it lasts only a few minutes.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 8
Unfortunately, managers rarely coordinate their efforts, leaving everybody to ask the same, superficial questions.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 8
but knowledge and ability to do the job are not the same thing.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 9
“What type of animal would you be?” The question has a truly voodoo answer key. “I look for people who have a witty answer.” Not only do questions like this lack any relevance or scientific basis, but they are utterly useless as predictors of on-the-job performance.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 10

Savvy candidates can easily fake the answers based on the job for which they are vying.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 10
The Fortune-Teller. Just like a fortune-teller looking in a crystal ball to predict the future, some interviewers like to ask their candidates to look into the future regarding the job at hand by asking hypothetical questions: “What would you do? How would you do it? Could you do it?” Fifty years of academic literature on interview methods makes a strong case against using these types of questions during interviews.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 11
Remember, it’s the walk that counts, not the talk.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 11
but one of the painful truths of hiring is this: it is hard to see people for who they really are.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 12
We define an A Player this way: a candidate who has at least a 90 percent chance of achieving a set of outcomes that only the top 10 percent of possible candidates could achieve.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 14
“Hiring A Players is not everything. But it is one of the most important skills to growing a large private equity firm, or</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 15
person to accomplish in a role. It is not a job description, but rather a set of outcomes and competencies that define a job done well.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 15
Systematic sourcing before you have slots to fill ensures you have high-quality candidates waiting when you need them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 15
a series of structured interviews that allow you to gather the relevant facts about a person so you can rate your scorecard and make an informed hiring decision.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 16
Selling the right way ensures you avoid the biggest pitfalls that cause the very people you want the most to take their talents elsewhere.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 20
“That’s not what we need at all! We don’t need a tactical planner. We need a visionary leader. We need someone who can survey the market and help us devise new strategies and create new products. We need someone to keep us ahead of the competition.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 20
The first failure point of hiring is not being crystal clear about what you really want the person you hire to accomplish.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 21
“In hiring, everything is situational,” he</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 21
You are going to need different types of leaders at different phases of organizations.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 21
That meant I needed somebody with high emotional intelligence, really strong knowledge of the business, really good interpersonal skills, and the ability to build bridges.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 21
The scorecard is composed of three parts: the job’s mission, outcomes, and competencies.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 23
If you’ve defined the position correctly from the outset, you should be looking for narrow but deep competence.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 25
You wouldn’t let your family-practice doctor perform open-heart surgery on you, and in the same way you shouldn’t look for a full team of generalists to solve your business problems.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 25
“I think success comes from having the right person in the right job at the right time with the right skill set for the business problem that exists.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 26
Gores has learned to rely on people with job-specific talents, rather than gunning for all-around athletes.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 26
“Each target and company has different needs for the CEO and any management role,”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 28
“Create and implement a new marketing campaign within 180 days of start date.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 29
Critical Competencies for A Players • Efficiency. Able to produce significant output with minimal wasted effort. • Honesty/integrity. Does not cut corners ethically. Earns trust and maintains confidences. Does what is right, not just what is politically expedient. Speaks plainly and truthfully. • Organization and planning.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 30
Plans, organizes, schedules, and budgets in an efficient, productive manner. Focuses on key priorities.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 30
• Aggressiveness. Moves quickly and takes a forceful stand without being overly abrasive.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 30
Follow-through on commitments.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 30
Lives up to verbal and written agreements, regardless of personal cost.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 30
Intelligence. Learns quickly. Demonstrates ability to quickly and proficiently understand and absorb new information.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 30
Analytical skills. Able to structure</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 30
and process qualitative or quantitative data and draw insightful conclusions from it. Exhibits a probing mind and achieves penetrating insights. • Attention to detail. Does not let important details slip through the cracks or derail a project.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 30
• Persistence. Demonstrates tenacity and willingness to go the distance to get something done.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 30
• Proactivity. Acts without being told what to do. Brings new ideas to the company.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 31
• Ability to hire A Players (for managers). Sources, selects, and sells A Players to join a company.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 31
Enthusiasm. Exhibits passion and excitement over work. Has a can-do attitude.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 31
Listening skills. Lets others speak and seeks to understand their viewpoints.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 31
Openness to criticism and ideas. Often solicits feedback and reacts calmly to criticism or negative feedback.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 31
• Communication. Speaks and writes clearly and articulately without being overly verbose or talkative. Maintains this standard in all forms of written communication, including e-mail.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 33
“Number two is commitment. Theirs to you and yours to them. That is a difficult thing to assess, but it really matters. I want people who are committed.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 33
“Third, are they coachable? I underestimated this earlier in my career. You can pass on learning and shortcut their development if they are.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 34
“What adjectives would you use to describe our culture?” Jot down their responses on a flip chart or whiteboard. It won’t take long before a picture emerges. We recently put a new client through this exercise. Soon the room buzzed with words such as analytical, fast-paced, and informal.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 38
By translating your culture and values into a series of competencies that matter for every job, you can avoid making the mistake of not evaluating candidates for the cultural fits that are absolutely</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 38
crucial to your enterprise.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 40
Scorecards solve that problem and ensure not just that you have A Players but that the A Players are delivering A performances.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 41
“The thing we valued at EMC was the willingness to go one more step than the next guy, to go one more step to service the customer,”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 41
To accomplish that, we specifically hired people who had an unusually high customer service attitude.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 41
Marino wasn’t hiring merely to fill a position. He was hiring to reinforce corporate strategy and culture, and he held the people he brought in accountable for accomplishing and demonstrating that every day. The results speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 41
Set expectations with new hires • Monitor employee progress over time</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 41
Objectify your annual review system • Allow you to rate your team annually as part of a talent review process</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 42
The whole key, whether you are hiring, promoting, or managing for performance in the current job, is that you have clear expectations. Having a clear, focused approach helps us be better managers</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 42
and therefore helps the people we hire have a higher likelihood of success.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 43
The board decided on a few competencies that really mattered to fit the culture they wanted to build and support the outcomes for the role. They wanted someone who was professional, disciplined, caring, fair, and diplomatic.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 44
2. OUTCOMES. Develop three to eight specific, objective outcomes that a person must accomplish to achieve an A performance. For example, “Improve customer satisfaction on a ten-point scale from 7.1 to 9.0</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 44
by December 31.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 46
“We found the process of gathering data from each candidate and comparing it to our scorecard very helpful and worthwhile.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 47
They consider themselves chief recruiting officers and expect all of their managers to view their jobs the same way.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 47
then. They are always sourcing, always on the lookout for new talent, always identifying the who before a new hire is really needed.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 48
Take a moment and think about how passive such an approach is.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 48
The overwhelming evidence from our field interviews is that ads are a good way to generate a tidal wave of resumes, but a lousy way to generate the right flow of candidates.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 49
Of all the ways to source candidates, the number one method is to ask for referrals from your personal and professional networks. This approach may feel scary and timeconsuming, but it is the single most effective way to find potential A Players.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 50
us, a full 77 percent of them cited referrals as their top technique for generating a flow of the right candidates for their businesses. Yet among average managers it is the least often practiced approach to sourcing.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 50
I am constantly on the hunt for talented people to bring into my company.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 51
names. Ryan captures those names on a list, and he makes a point of calling a few new people from his list every week. Then he stays in touch with those who seem to have the most promise.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 51
“Who are the most talented people you know that I should hire?”—can easily generate another fifty to one hundred names.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 51
no time you will have moved into many other networks and enriched your personal talent pool with real ability. But don’t stop there. Bring your broader business contacts in on the hunt, too. Ask your customers for the names of the most talented salespeople who call on them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 51
Ask your business partners who they think are the most effective business developers. Do the same with your suppliers to identify their strongest purchasing agents. Join professional organizations and ask the people you meet through events. People you interact with every day are</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 51
the most powerful sources of talent you will ever find.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 51
“Say, now that I have told you what I do, who are the most talented people you know who could be a good fit for my company?” Do that, and you will turn a common social question into a sourcing opportunity.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 52
Ryan nurtured his relationship with Case over a period of many years before finally convincing Case to succeed him as CEO.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 53
What sets Patrick Ryan apart from so many other executives is how he actively built his network through referrals, then followed up with high-potential candidates to maintain the relationship.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 54
“It takes A Players to know A Players,”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 54
“Our success rate is 60 percent higher for people who are referred by somebody else in our</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 54
At ghSMART, we’ve made in-house referrals a key part not only of our staffing policies but also of promotions.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 61
The conversation does not have to be long. We frequently begin with something simple like, “Sue recommended that you and I connect. I understand you are great at what you do. I am always on the lookout for talented people and would love the chance to get to know you. Even if you are perfectly content in your current job, I’d love to introduce myself and hear about your career interests.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 61
Most people will be thrilled to chat. Done well, you will find you can connect with forty or more new people per year.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 61
One more thing. When you are done with the call, assuming you were even moderately impressed with what you heard, be sure to ask the key follow-up question: “Now that you know a little about me, who are the most talented people you know who might be a good fit for my company?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 71
Ideally, a candidate will share career goals that match your company’s needs. If he or she lacks goals or sounds like an echo of your own Web site, screen the person out. You are done with the call. Talented people know what they want to do and are not afraid to tell you about it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 72
you still find yourself struggling, we recommend that you put the fear of the reference check into the person. You say, “If you advance to the next step in our process, we will ask for your help in setting up some references with bosses, peers, and subordinates. Okay?” The candidate will say, “Okay.” Then you say, “So I’m curious. What do you think they will say are some things you are not good at, or not interested</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 72
in?” Now you’ll get an honest and full answer.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 72
The thought that you will be talking to references and verifying the candidate’s answers compels the candidate to be much more truthful and complete than usual. You will be amazed how much of a truth serum this technique can be at this stage of the screening interview.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 73
Who were your last five bosses, and how will they each rate your performance on a 1–10 scale when we talk to them?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 75
about the answer by asking a follow-up question that begins with “What,” “How,” or “Tell me more.” Keep using this framework until you are clear about what the person is really saying.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 81
What Brad Smart discovered was the power of using data and patterns of behavior for making predictions about how somebody is likely</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 81
perform in the future.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 81
“The patterns become clearer and clearer,” he told us, “so it becomes easy to get a fix on exactly what the individual’s strengths and weaknesses are today. It discloses the likelihood that a person will</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 81
minimize weaker points. If the pattern is there of extracting success out of the jaws of defeat, that makes you want to hire somebody.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 83
This is where you will hear the stories behind the polished statements on a resume. In our experience, most</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 84
candidates naturally focus on what really mattered to them at that time in their career rather than regurgitate what they put on their resume.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 84
A Players tend to talk about outcomes linked to expectations. B and C Players talk generally about events, people they met, or aspects of the job they liked without ever getting into results.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 84
Our recommendation is to reframe the question over and over until the candidate gets the message. “What went really wrong? What was your biggest mistake? What would you have done differently? What part of the job did you not like? In what ways were</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 84
your peers stronger than you?” Don’t let the candidate off the hook. Keep pushing until the candidate shares the lows.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 85
Begin by asking candidates for their boss’s name. Ask them to spell it for you, and make a point to show them you are writing it down.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 85
“John Smith, you say? That is S, M, I, T, H, right?” Forcing candidates to spell the name out no matter how common it might be sends a powerful message: you are going to call, so they should tell the truth.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 85
Now ask, “What will Mr. Smith say were your biggest strengths and areas for improvement?” Be sure to say will, not would.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 88
A Players are highly valued by their bosses. B and C Players often are not.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 93
Thank you for taking the time to visit us today. As we have already discussed, we are going to do a chronological interview to walk through each job you have held. For each job I am going to ask you five core questions: What were you hired to do? What accomplishments are you most proud of? What were some low points during that job? Who were the people you</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 93
worked with? Why did you leave that job?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 94
At the end of the interview we will discuss your career goals and aspirations, and you will have a chance to ask me questions.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 94
Eighty percent of the process is in this room, but if we mutually decide to continue, we will conduct reference calls to complete the process.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 94
this sounds like a lengthy interview, it will go remarkably fast. I want to make sure you have the opportunity to share</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 94
your full story, so it is my job to guide the pace of the discussion. Sometimes, we’ll go into more depth in a period of your career. Other times, I will ask that we move on to the next topic. I’ll try to make sure we leave plenty of time to cover your</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 94
most recent, and frankly, most relevant jobs.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 94
Setting expectations will put the candidate at ease and enable you to launch into the first chapter of his or her career with minimal confusion</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 95
You will have to interrupt the candidate at least once every three or four minutes, so get ready.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 95
The good way to interrupt somebody is to smile broadly, match their enthusiasm level, and use reflective listening to get them to stop talking without demoralizing them. You say, “Wow! It sounds like that pig farm next to the corporate office smelled horrible!” The candidate nods and says “Yes!” and appreciates your empathy and respect. Then you immediately say, “You were just telling me about</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 96
is through maintaining very high rapport that you get the most valuable data, and polite</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 96
interrupting can build that rapport.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 96
you can use to clarify how valuable an accomplishment was in any context. The questions are:</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 96
How did your performance compare to the previous year’s performance? (For example, this person achieved sales of $2 million and the previous year’s sales were only $150,000.)</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 96
How did your performance compare to the plan?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 96
How did your performance compare to that of peers? (For example, this person sold $2 million and was ranked first among thirty peers; the next-best performer sold only</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 97
People who perform well are generally pulled to greater opportunities. People who perform poorly are often pushed out of their jobs. Do not hire anybody who has been pushed out of 20 percent or more of their jobs. From our experience, those folks have a three times higher chance of being a chronic B or C Player.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 97
Pull. “My biggest client hired me.” “My old boss recruited me to a bigger job.” “The CEO asked me to take a double promotion.” “A former peer went to a competitor and referred me to his boss.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 101
As with all of the interviews we present in this book, get curious after every answer by using the “What? How? Tell me more” framework, and keep asking until you understand what the person did and how he or she did it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 101
In addition, let’s say you have identified six competencies that define success in the job: 1. Aggressive 2. Persistent 3. Hires A Players 4. Holds people accountable 5. Follows through on commitments 6. Open to criticism and feedback</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 103
Mike Ahearn, First Solar’s CEO, painted the big picture for us. “We are a fast-moving, aggressive company.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 103
They need to be results-oriented people who work toward continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 103
And they have to put safety first, build deep customer relationships, and recognize that people matter.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 107
“What were the person’s biggest areas for improvement back then?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 109
answers. If you want to find out about a football team, the last person you talk to is the head coach. Don’t believe the coach. You talk to the players and the trainer and the managers.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 117
But he spent two hours of his time to save $10. So his need to win in that way makes him do stupid things. You should beware of candidates who need to win to an unhealthy extent because they will be battling you and your colleagues over petty things.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
“Starting a sentence with ‘no,’ ‘but,’ or ‘however’ during the interview process. ‘Yes, that is a great idea’ is the right answer.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
‘No, I agree with you but’ is the symptom of somebody with an overactive ego who might be challenging to work with.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
“Making destructive comments about previous colleagues is a huge red flag. Because once this person works for you, he or she will make the same needless sarcastic comments about you!</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
“Passing the buck. Blaming is always bad. Winners don’t blame.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
“Making excuses. Ask people what their challenges were. If they say that their biggest challenges were</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
not their fault but other people’s fault, that shows they do not take responsibility for their performance.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
“The excessive need to ‘be me.’ Listen for comments like ‘That’s just me, I’m not organized.’ ‘That’s just me, I’m impatient.’ ‘That’s just me, I don’t include other people in decisions. That’s just the way I am.’ Beware. Somebody who has an excessive need to ‘be me’ is telling you that they are not open to adapt their style to fit your culture or your company and</p>

But wait, you are not finished. Have you heard the riddle about the five frogs on a log? It goes like this: Five frogs are on a log and one decides to jump off. How many are left? If you answered “five,” you are correct. Deciding to do something and actually doing it are two different things. You have decided who you should hire. Now it is time to take the final step: selling the person on actually joining your team.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
questions. Probe for more information by using the “What? How? Tell me more” framework.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
Conduct a Who Interview of one and a half to three hours by walking chronologically through a candidate’s career, using the same five questions for each job or chapter in the person’s work history. The hiring manager and one other colleague should conduct the interview in tandem. 3. FOCUSED INVERVIEW(S): Involve others in the hiring process by assigning team members to conduct interviews that focus on the outcomes and/or competencies on the scorecard. 4. CANDIDATE DISCUSSION: Following each day of interviews, grade the scorecard using the skill-will framework. Advance those whose skill (what they are fundamentally good at doing) and will (what they want to do, and in what type of culture) match the mission, outcomes, and competencies on your scorecard. Look for people whom you would rate an A on the critical outcomes and key competencies. Nobody is perfect, but seek those who are strong in the most important places of your scorecard. 5. REFERENCE INTERVIEW: Conduct seven reference calls with people you choose from the Who Interview. Ask the candidate to set up the calls to break through the gatekeepers while minimizing your own effort. 6. FINAL DECISION: Repeat your analysis of the skill-will profile to</p>

The challenge, Echavarría told us, is to walk them through the larger fit with company and culture.</p>

“Our corporate culture is low-key. It is a family company, not a public company. We have a high appreciation for values. We don’t like people who are too ostentatious or too self-sufficient. We are multinational, so we need people who can adapt to foreign cultures and our company culture.”</p>

“This is hard. This is fun.” That’s the moment I knew I was changing mindsets.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 25
There was a saying in the 1960s that went: “Becoming is better than being.” The fixed mindset does not allow people the luxury of becoming. They have to already be.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 27
But isn’t potential someone’s capacity to develop their skills with effort over time?</p>

You cannot determine the slope of a line given only one point, as there is no line to begin with. A single point in time does not show trends, improvement, lack of effort, or mathematical ability….  </p>

Marina Semyonova, the famed ballet teacher, who chose the students who were energized by criticism.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 29
Until I discovered the mindsets and</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 29
how they work, I, too, thought of myself as more talented than others, maybe even more worthy than others because of my endowments. The scariest thought, which I rarely entertained, was the possibility of being ordinary. This kind of thinking led me to need constant validation. Every comment, every look was meaningful—it registered on my intelligence scorecard, my attractiveness scorecard, my likability scorecard. If a day went well, I could bask in my high numbers.</p>

People were praising me like I was a religious cult or something. That was very embarrassing. I’m a human being like everyone else.” Jordan knew how hard he had worked to develop his abilities. He was a person who had struggled and grown, not a person who was inherently better than others.</p>

If you’re somebody when you’re successful, what are you when you’re unsuccessful?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 32
MINDSETS CHANGE THE MEANING OF FAILURE</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 33
As a New York Times article points out, failure has been transformed from an action (I failed) to an identity (I am a failure). This is especially true in the fixed mindset.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 33
risk turning from a success into a failure? From a winner into a loser?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 33
Even in the growth mindset, failure can be a painful experience. But it doesn’t define you. It’s a problem to be faced, dealt with, and learned from.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 34
Instead of letting the experience define him, he took control of it. He used it to become a better player and, he believes, a better person.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 34
Around the publication of the 2003 Guide Michelin, however, Mr. Loiseau committed suicide.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 34
the idea of failure had possessed him.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 37
John Wooden, the legendary basketball coach, says you aren’t a failure until you start to blame.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 39
When people believe their basic qualities can be developed, failures may still hurt, but failures don’t define them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 41
Malcolm Gladwell, the author and New Yorker writer, has suggested that as a society we value natural, effortless accomplishment over achievement through effort.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 44
For her, politics did not provide the personal creative effort she valued most,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 52
I’ve always had a problem with confidence. My coaches always told me to believe in myself 100%. They told me not to let any doubts enter my mind and to think about how I’m better than everyone else.</p>

Most often people believe that the “gift” is the ability itself. Yet what feeds it is that constant, endless curiosity and challenge seeking.</p>

Is everyone capable of great things with the right mindset?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 64
With the right mindset and the right teaching, people are capable of a lot more than we think.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 64
With his growth mindset, he asked “How can I teach them?” not “Can I teach them?” and “How will they learn best?” not “Can they learn?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 64
there’s a lot of intelligence out there being wasted by underestimating students’ potential to develop.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 67
The fixed mindset limits achievement. It fills people’s minds with interfering thoughts, it makes effort disagreeable, and it leads to inferior learning strategies.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 67
What’s more, it makes other people into judges instead of allies.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 67
important achievements require a clear focus, all-out effort, and a bottomless trunk full of strategies.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 68
people don’t understand the components—the learnable components—of drawing. Actually, she informs us, they are not drawing skills at all, but seeing skills. They are the ability to perceive edges, spaces, relationships, lights and shadows, and the whole. Drawing requires us to learn each component skill and then combine them into one process. Some people simply pick up these skills in the natural course of their lives, whereas others have to work to learn them and put them together.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 70
she argues that creativity is not a magical act of inspiration. It’s the result of hard work and dedication.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 72
In contrast, when students were praised for effort, 90 percent of them wanted the challenging new task that they could learn from.</p>

Guettel echoes this. “In my family, to be good is to fail. To be very good is to fail…. The only thing not a failure is to be great.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 72
Here’s Adam Guettel: “I wish I could just have fun and relax and not have the responsibility of that potential to be some kind of great man.” As with the kids in our study, the burden of talent was killing his enjoyment.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 73
One thing is hopeful—his recognition that he has his own life course to follow that is not dictated by other people and their view of his talent.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 73
What’s so alarming is that we took ordinary children and made them into liars, simply by telling them they were smart.</p>

checking a box to indicate your race or sex can trigger the stereotype in your mind and lower your test score.</p>

Males say it to each other all the time. It may not be a kind thing to say, even in jest, but it certainly makes them think twice before buying into other people’s evaluations.</p>

It was inconceivable to him that you could have a goal and not take steps to make it happen.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 80
Their heads are not filled with limiting thoughts, a fragile sense of belonging, and a belief that other people can define them.</p>

Remember our study where praising kids’ ability lowered their IQ scores. Find a growth-mindset way to compliment them.</p>

It was gravy that his mind was so sharp and that he made up amusing poems, but we still think his greatness resided in his physique.</p>

For Jordan, success stems from the mind. “The mental toughness and the heart are a lot stronger than some of the physical advantages you might have.</p>

what is the most important thing for a soccer player to have?” With no hesitation, she answered, “Mental toughness.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 97
All of these people had character. None of them thought they were special people, born with the right to win. They were people who worked hard, who learned how to keep their focus under pressure, and who stretched beyond their ordinary abilities when they had to.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 98
idea—that personal success is when you work your hardest to become your best—was</p>

Mia Hamm tells us, “After every game or practice, if you walk off the field knowing that you gave everything you had, you will always be a winner.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 99
Those with the growth mindset found setbacks motivating. They’re informative. They’re a wake-up call.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 107
It’s what makes great athletes and it’s what comes from the growth mindset with its focus on self-development, self-motivation, and responsibility.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 108
sowed the seeds of its demise.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 109
We know from our studies that people with the fixed mindset do not admit and correct their deficiencies.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 109
The fixed mindset had made a flaw intolerable.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 110
as Collins reports in his book, Good to Great,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 114
Warren Bennis, the leadership guru, studied the world’s greatest corporate leaders.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 123
writes in his book Brutal Bosses that</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 123
this kind of abuse represents the bosses’ desire “to enhance their own feelings of power, competence, and value at the subordinate’s expense.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 123
a “perfectionist,” but that was a euphemism for “abuser.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 123
if you’re really concerned about our performance, you don’t pick on those who are performing best.” But if you’re really concerned about your competence, you do.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 125
their minds are always on one thing: Validate me!</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 127
What he learned was this: True self-confidence is “the courage to be open—to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source.” Real</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 127
self-confidence is not reflected in a title, an expensive suit, a fancy car, or a series of acquisitions. It is reflected in your mindset: your readiness to grow.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 128
“Eventually I learned that I was really looking for people who were filled with passion and a desire to get things done. A resume didn’t tell me much about that inner hunger.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 128
Then he spread the word: This company is about growth, not self-importance.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 129
opened the channels of communication up</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 130
Genius is not enough; we need to get the job done.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 132
leadership is about growth and passion,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 134
GROUPTHINK VERSUS WE THINK</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 135
“I take it we are all in complete agreement on the decision here…. Then I propose we postpone further discussion of this matter until our next meeting to give ourselves time to develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding of what the decision is all about.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 136
a growth mindset—by relieving people of the illusions or the burdens of fixed ability—leads to a full and open discussion of the information and to enhanced decision making.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 137
We now have a workforce full of people who need constant reassurance and can’t take criticism.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 137
If the wrong kinds of praise lead kids down the path of entitlement, dependence, and fragility, maybe the right kinds of praise can lead them down the path of hard work and greater hardiness.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 137
Instead of just giving employees an award for the smartest idea or praise for a brilliant performance, they would get praise for taking initiative, for seeing a difficult task through, for struggling and learning something new, for being undaunted by a setback, or for being open to and acting on criticism. Maybe it could be praise for not needing constant praise!</p>

Presenting skills as learnable ■ Conveying that the organization values learning and perseverance, not just ready-made genius or talent</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 141
Giving feedback in a way that promotes learning and future success ■ Presenting managers as resources for learning</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 141
With a belief in development, such programs give meaning to the term “human resources” and become a means of tapping enormous potential.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 141
Sadly, most managers and even CEOs become bosses, not leaders. They wield power instead of transforming themselves, their workers, and their organization.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 142
Create an organization that prizes the development of ability—and watch the leaders emerge.</p>

this. Almost everyone, at one time or another, had been in love and had been hurt. What differed—and differed dramatically—was how they dealt with it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 145
“Revenge is sweet”—the idea that with revenge comes your redemption—because people with the growth mindset have little taste for it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 145
There is a French expression: “Tout comprendre c’est tout pardonner.” To understand all is to forgive all.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 146
“I’ll be damned if I’m going to sit here and feel sorry for myself!”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 148
The growth mindset says all of these things can be developed. All—you, your partner, and the relationship—are capable of growth and change.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 150
Aaron Beck, noted marriage authority, says that one of the most destructive beliefs for a relationship is “If we need to work at it, there’s something seriously wrong with our relationship.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 152
with the fixed mindset is the belief that problems are a sign of deep-seated flaws.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 152
But just as there are no great achievements without setbacks, there are no great relationships without conflicts and problems along the</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 152
When people with a fixed mindset talk about their conflicts, they assign blame.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 152
Sometimes they blame themselves, but often they blame their partner. And they assign blame to a trait—a character flaw.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 153
there. When people blame their partner’s personality for the problem, they feel anger and disgust toward them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 154
Relationship expert Daniel Wile says that choosing a partner is choosing a set of problems. There are no problem-free candidates. The trick is to acknowledge each other’s limitations, and build from there.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 155
It was a problem of communication, not a problem of personality or character. Yet in the fixed mindset, the blame came fast and furious.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 155
In the end, this marriage was saved—only because the couple learned to respond to each other not with angry labels, but with helpful actions. One day, when Karen was swamped with work, Ted came home to a messy house. He was angry and wanted to scold her, but, drawing on what he’d learned from Beck, he instead said to himself, “What is the mature thing to do?” He answered his own question by starting to clean things up. He was offering Karen support rather than judgment.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 156
Aaron Beck tells couples in counseling never to think these fixed-mindset thoughts: My partner is incapable of change. Nothing can improve our relationship. These ideas, he says, are almost always wrong.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 156
Bill was a permanently bad and untrustworthy husband or a man who needed a lot of help.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 156
Yet Hillary could not have forgiven a person she saw as a liar and a cheat. She could only forgive a man she thought was earnestly struggling with his problems and trying to grow.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 157
With the fixed mindset, one moment your partner is the light of your life, the next they’re your adversary.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 157
fact, in the fixed mindset you have a limited set of choices. One is to blame your own permanent qualities. And one is to blame your partner’s. You can see how tempting</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 157
it is to foist the blame onto the other guy.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 157
and assign blame when something in a relationship goes wrong. “It’s not my fault!” To deal with this bad habit, my husband and I invented a third party, an imaginary man named Maurice. Whenever I start in on who’s to blame, we</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 157
invoke poor Maurice and pin it on him.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 158
relationship. The rest is not really relevant since I wasn’t seeking validation, but I’ll tell you anyway.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 158
What allowed me to take that first step, to choose growth and risk rejection? In the fixed mindset, I had needed my blame and bitterness. It made me feel more righteous, powerful, and whole than thinking I was at fault. The growth mindset allowed me to give up the blame and move on. The growth mindset gave me a mother.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 158
In a relationship, the growth mindset lets you rise above blame, understand the problem, and try to fix it—together.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 158
In the fixed mindset, where you’ve got to keep proving your competence, it’s easy to get into a competition with your partner. Who’s the smarter, more talented, more likable one?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 160
“Oh no,” I replied. “To me the whole point of marriage is to encourage your partner’s development and have them encourage yours.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 161
This mentality can intrude on friendships. The lower you are, the better I feel is the idea.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 163
Beer found, first, that people with the fixed mindset were more likely to be shy.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 163
This makes sense. The fixed mindset makes you concerned about judgment, and this can make you more self-conscious and anxious.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 163
Shyness harmed the social interactions of people with the fixed mindset but did not harm the social relations of people with the growth mindset.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 164
shy growth-mindset people take control of their shyness. They go out and meet new people, and, after their nerves settle down, their relationships proceed normally. The shyness doesn’t tyrannize them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 167
In our study, the students with the growth mindset were not as prone to see the bullying as a reflection of who they were. Instead, they saw it as a psychological problem of the bullies, a way for the bullies to gain status or charge their self-esteem: “I’d think that the reason he is bothering me is probably that he has problems at home or at school with his grades.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 168
would want to forgive them eventually” and “My number one goal would be to help them become better people.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 168
“People do have the potential to change.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 169
Bullies judge. Victims take it in. Sometimes it remains inside and can lead to depression and suicide. Sometimes it explodes into violence.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 170
What Davis does is this. First, while enforcing consistent discipline, he doesn’t judge the bully as a person. No criticism is directed at traits. Instead, he makes them feel liked and welcome at school every day.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 170
direction. But again, he does not praise the person; he praises their effort.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 170
notice that you have been staying out of fights. That tells me you are working on getting along with people.” You can see that Davis is leading students directly to the growth mindset. He is helping them see their actions as part of an effort to improve. Even if the change was not intentional on the part of the bullies, they may now try to make it so.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 171
but hopeful of forgiving, learning, and moving on? Think of the worst rejection you ever had. Get in touch with all the feelings, and see if you can view it from a growth mindset. What did you learn from it? Did it teach you something about what you want and don’t want in your life? Did it teach you some positive things that were useful in later relationships? Can you forgive that person and wish them well? Can you let go of the bitterness?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 172
Problems can be a vehicle for developing greater understanding and intimacy. Allow your partner to air his or her differences, listen carefully, and discuss them in a patient and caring manner.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 172
Are you a blamer like me? It’s not good for a relationship to pin everything on your partner. Create your own Maurice and blame him instead. Better yet, work toward curing yourself of the need to blame. Move beyond thinking about fault and blame all the time. Think of me trying to do that too.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 172
Are you shy? Then you really need the growth mindset. Even if it doesn’t cure your shyness, it will help keep it from messing up your social interactions. Next time you’re venturing into a social situation, think about these things: how social skills are things you can improve and how social interactions are for learning and enjoyment, not judgment. Keep practicing this.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 173
“I would do anything, give anything, to make my children successful.” Yet many of the things they do boomerang. Their helpful judgments, their lessons, their motivating techniques often send the wrong message.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 173
You are a developing person and I am interested in your development.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 175
If success means they’re smart, then failure means they’re dumb. That’s the fixed mindset.</p>

“You’re brilliant!” Needless to say, I was appalled at what I had done, and as the look of horror spread over my face, he rushed to reassure me. “I know you meant it in the most ‘growth-minded’ way. That I searched for strategies, kept at it, tried all kinds of solutions, and finally mastered it.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 177
“You really studied for your test and your improvement shows it. You read the material over several times,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 178
I’m really excited about how you’re stretching yourself now and working to learn hard things.”</p>

(This may be especially important for children with learning disabilities. Often for them it is not sheer effort that works but finding the right strategy.)</p>

“Praise should deal, not with the child’s personality attributes, but with his efforts and achievements.”</p>

Sometimes people are careful to use growth-oriented praise with their children but then ruin it by the way they talk about others.</p>

have heard parents say in front of their children, “He’s just a born loser,” “She’s a natural genius,” or “She’s a</p>

When children hear their parents level fixed judgments at others, it communicates a fixed mindset. And they have to wonder, Am I next?</p>

There are some people who are born smart in math and everything is easy for them. Then there are the rest of you. For the other half of the students, we talked about the mathematicians as people who became passionate about math and ended up making great discoveries. This brought students into a growth mindset.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 179
Skills and achievement come through commitment and effort.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 180
The night before each test, her parents, seeing how distraught she was, tried to build her confidence. “Look, you know how smart you are and we know how smart you are. You’ve got this nailed. Now, stop worrying.” They were as supportive as they knew how to be, but they were raising the stakes even higher. What could they have said instead? “It must be a terrible thing to feel that everyone is evaluating you and you can’t show what you know. We want you to know that we are not evaluating you. We care about your learning, and we know that you’ve learned your stuff. We’re proud that you’ve stuck to it and kept learning.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 180
Praising success should be the least of our problems, right? Failure seems like a much more delicate matter.</p>

Children as young as toddlers pick up these messages from their parents, learning that their mistakes are worthy of judgment and punishment. Or learning that their mistakes are an occasion for suggestions and teaching.</p>

Don’t judge. Teach. It’s a learning process.</p>

I hope these stories will teach parents to “want the best” for their children in the right way—by fostering their interests, growth, and learning.</p>

The great teachers believe in the growth of the intellect and talent, and they are fascinated with the process of learning.</p>

he found something fascinating. For most of them, their first teachers were incredibly warm and accepting. Not that they set low standards. Not at all, but they created an atmosphere of trust, not judgment. It was, “I’m going to teach you,” not “I’m going to judge your talent.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 201
One of Marva Collins’s first mentors taught her the same thing—that, above all, a good teacher is one who continues to learn along with the students. And she let her students know that right up front: “Sometimes I don’t like other grown-ups very much because they think they know everything. I don’t know everything. I can learn all the time.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 202
The fixed mindset makes people complicated. It makes them worried about their fixed traits and creates the need to document them, sometimes at your expense. And it makes them judgmental.</p>

I’ll say to her, ‘Dear, I’d like to talk about something that I think will make us happier.’”</p>

Think of something you need to do, something you want to learn, or a problem you have to confront. What is it? Now make a concrete plan. When will you follow through on your plan? Where will you do it? How will you do it? Think about it in vivid detail.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 228
These concrete plans—plans you can visualize—about when, where, and how you are going to do something lead to really high levels of follow-through, which, of course, ups the chances of success. So the idea is not only to make a growth-mindset plan, but also to visualize, in a concrete way, how you’re going to carry it out.</p>

“If only I had more money” is the easiest way to postpone the intense self-examination and decision-making necessary to create a life of enjoyment—now and not later.</p>

Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 887
What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do.</p>

a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have.</p>

The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man. —GEORGE BERNARD SHAW, Maxims for Revolutionists SPRING 2005 / PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY I HAD TO bribe them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 937
Doing the Unrealistic Is Easier Than Doing the Realistic</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 943
If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 945
Having an unusually large goal is an adrenaline infusion that provides the endurance to overcome the inevitable trials and tribulations that go along with any goal. Realistic goals, goals restricted to the average ambition level, are uninspiring and will only fuel you through the first or second problem,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 947
at which point you throw in the towel. If the potential payoff is mediocre or average, so is your effort.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 949
because it is “realistic,” I won’t have the enthusiasm to</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 953
There is just less competition for bigger goals. Doing big things begins with asking for them properly.</p>

Perfection is not when there is no more to add, but no more to take away.</p>

Being busy is most often used as a guise for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable actions. The options are almost limitless for creating “busyness”:</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,250
Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,303
Slow down and remember this: Most things make no difference. Being busy is a form of laziness—lazy thinking and indiscriminate action.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,306
Focus on the important few and ignore the rest.</p>

Parkinson’s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,346
The end product of the shorter deadline is almost inevitably of equal or higher quality due to greater focus.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,349
1. Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20). 2. Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson’s Law).</p>

without deadlines that create focus,</p>

Use a preplanned project or emergency (family issue, personal issue, relocation, home repairs, whatever) that requires you to take one or two weeks out of the office. 2. Say that you recognize you can’t just stop working and that you would prefer to work instead of taking vacation days. 3. Propose how you can work remotely and offer, if necessary, to take a pay cut for that period (and that period only) if performance isn’t up to par upon returning. 4. Allow the boss to collaborate on how to do it so that he or she is invested in the process. 5. Make the two weeks “off” the most productive period you’ve ever had at work. 6. Show your boss the quantifiable results upon returning, and tell him or her that—without all the distractions, commute, etc.—you can get twice as much done. Suggest two or three days</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 4,206
at home per week as a trial for two weeks. 7. Make those remote days ultraproductive. 8. Suggest only one or two days in the office per week. 9. Make those days the least productive of the week. 10. Suggest complete mobility—the boss will go for it.</p>

6. Practice the art of getting past “no” before proposing.</p>

“What would I need to do to [desired outcome]?” “Under what circumstances would you [desired</p>

8. Extend each successful trial period until you reach full-time or your desired level of mobility. Don’t underestimate how much your company needs you. Perform well and ask for what you want. If you don’t get it over time, leave. It’s too big a world to spend most of life in a cubicle.</p>

No more changing hotels midtrip to avoid noise. AND, I know we have to travel light, but with baby a lot of things are nonnegotiable. These make for smoother sailing: (1) Peanut shell sling in black fleece—it’s more comfy than the cotton and you can pop baby in and out wherever you are, from birth to 35 lbs. I never take mine off, it’s part of my outfit; (2) Peapod plus portable tent—this is baby’s main bed at home and travel so baby has the same sleep place everywhere we go, and the flaps give all travel parties privacy—great from small babies to five-year-olds. I can still jam this onto a little wheeled carry-on and</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 4,284
pack mine and baby’s minimal clothing around it; (3) Go Go Kidz TravelMate (great for wheeling car seat up to the gate for gate check or use on plane); (4) Britax Diplomat car seat is small but kids can use it from birth to approx. four years old. Make sure the wheeled carry-on bag you get is one size smaller than the allowed carry-on size so you don’t get bumped to check the bag in if the plane is full. You can always nicely argue/reason/bat your eyelashes that you will put the bag in your foot space. Also, very helpful to give baby something to sip or munch on during takeoff and landing so yours isn’t the baby screaming from ear pain. Happy travels!</p>

They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil.

WHAT YOU TRACK DETERMINES YOUR LENS—CHOOSE CAREFULLY “Those of us who are lucky enough to live in a world where we have enough and we have a roof and we have food—we find ourselves caught in this cycle of keeping track of the wrong things. Keeping track of how many times we’ve been rejected. Keeping track of how many times it didn’t work. Keeping track of all the times someone has broken our heart or double-crossed us or let us down. Of course, we can keep track of those things, but why? Why keep track of them? Are they making us better? “Wouldn’t it make more sense to keep track of the other stuff? To keep track of all the times it worked? All the times we took a risk? All the times we were able to brighten someone else’s day? When we start doing that, we can redefine ourselves as people who are able to make an impact on the world. It took me a bunch of cycles to figure out that the narrative was up to me. “If a narrative isn’t working, well then, really, why are you using it?

IF YOU CAN’T GENERATE 10 IDEAS, GENERATE 20 James recommends the habit of writing down 10 ideas each morning in a waiter’s pad or tiny notebook. This exercise is for developing your “idea muscle” and confidence for creativity on demand, so regular practice is more important than the topics:</p>

“What if [you] just can’t come up with 10 ideas? Here’s the magic trick: If you can’t come up with 10 ideas, come up with 20 ideas…. You are putting too much pressure on yourself. Perfectionism is the ENEMY of the idea muscle … it’s your brain trying to protect you from harm, from coming up with an idea that is embarrassing and stupid and could cause you to suffer pain.

When healthy people fall in love, they buy a bunch of flowers or an engagement ring and go and Do Something About It. When poets fall in love, they make a list of their loved one’s body parts and attach similes to them.

The reason for Tolkien’s mistake, since you ask, is that adjectives in English absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that word order in the slightest you’ll sound like a maniac. It’s an odd thing that every English speaker uses that list, but almost none of us could write it out. And as size comes before colour, green great dragons can’t exist.</p>

Mitch: That’s great, but what’s the “one thing”? Curly: That’s what you’ve got to figure out.</p>

Finally, out of desperation, I went as small as I could possibly go and asked: “What’s the ONE Thing you can do this week such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?” And the most awesome thing happened.</p>

Where I’d had huge success, I had narrowed my concentration to one thing, and where my success varied, my focus had too. And the light came on.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 95
extraordinary results are directly determined by how narrow you can make your focus.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 134
Getting extraordinary results is all about creating a domino effect in your life.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 145
The key is over time. Success is built sequentially. It’s one thing at a time.</p>

Amorico, Italy’s most successful tour guide, says he developed his skills and ultimately his business from his singular passion for his country and the deep desire to share it with others.</p>

When everything feels urgent and important, everything seems equal. We become active and busy, but this doesn’t actually move us any closer to success.</p>

Knocking out a hundred tasks for whatever the reason is a poor substitute for doing even one task that’s meaningful.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 325
Achievers do sooner what others plan to do later and defer, perhaps indefinitely, what others do sooner.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 331
Instead of a to-do list, you need a success list—a list that is purposefully created around extraordinary results.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 332
To-do lists tend to be long; success lists are short.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 355
“The 80/20 Principle asserts that a minority of causes, inputs, or effort usually lead to a majority of the results, outputs, or rewards.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 361
the majority of what you want will come from the minority of what you do.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 365
Juran’s great insight was that not everything matters equally; some things matter more than others—a lot more. A to-do list becomes a success list when you apply Pareto’s Principle to it.</p>

A few ideas gave me most of my results.</p>

No matter how many to-dos you start with, you can always narrow it to one.</p>

focus on being productive.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 405
Once you’ve figured out what actually matters, keep asking what matters most until there is only one thing left.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 411
The truth is that things don’t matter equally and success is found in doing what matters most.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 436
“Multitasking is merely the opportunity to screw up more than one thing at a time.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 452
It’s not that we have too little time to do all the things we need to do, it’s that we feel the need to do too many things in the time we have. So we double and triple up in the hope of getting everything done.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 464
With an average of 4,000 thoughts a day flying in and out of our heads, it’s easy to see why we try to multitask.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 472
It’s what researchers refer to as “task switching.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 476
relative complexity of those tasks makes it impossible to easily jump back and forth.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 540
When you try to do too much at once, you can end up doing nothing well.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 553
Success is actually a short race—a sprint fueled by discipline just long enough for habit to kick in and take over.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 557
When you discipline yourself, you’re essentially training yourself to act in a specific way. Stay with this long enough and it becomes routine—in other words, a habit.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 563
You don’t need to be a disciplined person to be successful. In fact, you can become successful with less discipline than you think, for one simple reason: success is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 565
The trick to success is to choose the right habit and bring just enough discipline to establish it.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 583
What sometimes gets overlooked, however, is an amazing windfall: it also simplifies your life. Your life gets clearer and less complicated because you know what you have to do well and you know what you don’t.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 585
When you do the right thing, it can liberate you from having to monitor everything.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 593
The hard stuff becomes habit, and habit makes the hard stuff easy.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 611
Be a person of powerful habits and use selected discipline to develop them.</p>

Purpose, meaning, significance—these are what make a successful life.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 774
The act of living a full life by giving time to what matters is a balancing act.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 774
Extraordinary results require focused attention and time.</p>

Jared Diamond’s Pulitzer Prize–winning Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies illustrates how farm-based societies that generated a surplus of food ultimately gave rise to professional specialization.</p>

Knowing when to pursue the middle and when to pursue the extremes is in essence the true beginning of wisdom.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 806
The reason we shouldn’t pursue balance is that the magic never happens in the middle; magic happens at the extremes.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 856
the key ingredient is focused time over time.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 856
To achieve an extraordinary result you must choose what matters most and give it all the time it demands. This requires getting extremely out of balance in relation to all other work issues, with only infrequent counterbalancing to address them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 861
Your personal life requires tight counterbalancing.</p>

Dr. Martin Seligman, past president of the American Psychological Association, believes there are five factors that contribute to our happiness: positive emotion and pleasure, achievement, relationships, engagement, and meaning. Of these, he believes engagement and meaning are the most important.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,452
When our daily actions fulfill a bigger purpose, the most powerful and enduring happiness can happen.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,458
My response is, “It is, and it isn’t. It all depends on what you’d do with it.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,478
Live with purpose and don’t be surprised if you actually hum more and even whistle while you work.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,483
The surest path to achieving lasting happiness happens when you make your life about something bigger, when you bring meaning and purpose to your everyday actions.</p>

It’s an ordinary occurrence, oddly named hyperbolic discounting—the farther away a reward is in the future, the smaller the immediate motivation to achieve it.</p>

Researchers call this the “planning fallacy.” Visualizing the process—breaking a big goal down into the steps needed to achieve it—helps engage the strategic thinking you need to plan for and achieve extraordinary results. This is why Goal Setting to the Now really works.</p>

“What type of time-managing system do you use?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,637
Time blocking is a very results-oriented way of viewing and using time.</p>

Time blocking harnesses your energy and centers it on your most important work. It’s productivity’s greatest power tool.</p>

In truth, the most successful simply see themselves as working between vacations. On the other hand, the least successful don’t reserve time off, because they don’t think they’ll deserve it or be able to afford it.</p>

Basically, mornings are my prime writing time.” Four hours a day may scare you more than King’s novels, but you can’t argue with his results.

There is nothing more important to true growth than realizing that you are not the voice of the mind—you are the one who hears it.</p>

The truth is that most of life will unfold in accordance with forces far outside your control, regardless of what your mind says about it.</p>

They are simply making you feel better or worse about what is going on now, what has gone on in the past, or what might go on in the future.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 10
there is no reason to constantly attempt to figure everything out. Eventually you will see that the real cause of problems is not life itself. It’s the commotion the mind makes about life that really causes problems.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 12
What you end up experiencing is really a personal presentation of the world according to you, rather than the stark, unfiltered experience of what is really out there.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 12
Your consciousness is actually experiencing your mental model of reality, not reality itself.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 12
If you can’t get the world the way you like it, you internally verbalize it, judge it, complain about it, and then decide what to do about</p>

If you decide not to narrate and, instead, just consciously observe the world, you will feel more open and exposed.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 14
You will come to see that the mind talks all the time because you gave it a job to do. You use it as a protection mechanism, a form of defense.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 14
True personal growth is about transcending the part of you that is not okay and needs protection.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 14
The one inside who is aware that you are always talking to yourself about yourself is always silent. It is a doorway to the depths of your being.</p>

There is nothing you can’t do. Your will is supreme over all of this.</p>

You do this as though your life depended on it, because it does. As it is right now, your life is not your own; it belongs to your inner roommate, the psyche. You have to take it back.

You could actually be in the habit of experiencing an uptight, closing sensation whenever somebody walks up to you. You can train yourself to do the opposite. You can train yourself to open every time you see a person.</p>

What you’ll find is that the only thing you really want from life is to feel enthusiasm, joy, and love. If you can feel that all the time, then who cares what happens outside?</p>

if you can always feel excited about the experience of the moment, then it doesn’t make any difference what the experience is.</p>

No matter what anyone does, no matter what situation takes place, you won’t even feel the tendency to close. You will just embrace life with all your heart and soul.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 48
As long as you are defining what you like and what you don’t like, you will open and close. You are actually defining your limits. You are allowing your mind to create triggers that open and close you.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 48
Let go of that. Dare to be different. Enjoy all of life.</p>

Life must now compete with this blocked event for your attention, and the impression does not just sit in there quietly.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 53
In the yogic tradition, that unfinished energy pattern is called a Samskara. This is a Sanskrit word meaning “impression,” and in the yogic teachings it is considered one of the most important influences affecting your life. A Samskara is a blockage, an impression from the past. It’s an unfinished energy pattern that ends up running your life.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 57
The alternative is to be willing to let it go when it gets stimulated. It only hurts for a minute and then it’s over.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 60
Because most of us don’t have to worry about food, clothing, or shelter, we have the luxury of worrying about a spot on our pants, or laughing too loud, or saying something wrong. Because we’ve developed this hypersensitive psyche, we constantly use our energies to close around it and protect ourselves. But this process only hides the problems; it doesn’t fix them. You’re locking your illness inside yourself,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 61
if you protect yourself, you will never be free. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 62
Once you close, you have to make sure that what you protected doesn’t get disturbed. You then carry this task for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 62
day. How often do you find yourself trying to protect and defend that weak part of you? You feel like the world wants to get right at it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 62
The reward for not protecting your psyche is liberation. You are free to walk through this world without a problem</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 62
You are just having fun experiencing whatever happens next.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 62
disturbed. You no longer have to listen to “What will they think of me?” or, “Oh God, I wish I hadn’t said that. It sounded so stupid.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 62
Spiritual growth is about the point at which you start to feel your energy change.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 62
For instance, somebody says something, and you start to feel the energy get a little strange inside. You will actually start to feel a tightening. That is your cue that it’s time to grow. It’s not time to defend yourself, because you don’t want the part of you that you would be defending.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 64
This technique of freeing yourself is done with the understanding that thoughts and emotions are just objects of consciousness.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 64
consciousness. If you want to be free, then every time you feel any change in the energy flow, relax behind it. Don’t fight with it, don’t try to change it, and don’t judge it. Don’t say, “Oh, I can’t believe I’m still feeling this. I promised myself I wouldn’t think about that car anymore.” Don’t do that; you’ll just end up going with the guilt thoughts instead of the car thoughts. You have to let them all go.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 65
Only you can take inner freedom away from yourself, or give it to yourself. Nobody else can.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 71
If you have a lot of fear, you won’t like change. You’ll try to create a world around you that is predictable, controllable, and definable. You’ll try to create a world that doesn’t stimulate your fears. Fear doesn’t want to feel itself; it’s actually afraid of itself.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 71
You can do one of two things with fear: you can recognize that you have it and work to release it, or you can keep it and try to hide from</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 72
Your definitions of desirable and undesirable, as well as good and bad, all come about because you have defined how things need to be in order for you to be okay.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 72
As you grow spiritually, you will realize that your attempts to protect yourself from your problems actually create more problems.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 73
When your heart is weak it becomes susceptible to lower vibrations, and one of the lowest of all vibrations is fear. Fear is the cause of every problem. It’s the root of all prejudices and the negative emotions of anger, jealousy, and possessiveness.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 73
You’d be willing to face everything and everyone because you wouldn’t have fear inside of you that could cause you disturbance.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 73
The purpose of spiritual evolution is to remove the blockages that cause your fear.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 74
Everyone is saying, “I will do every single thing I can to keep my stuff. If you say anything that disturbs me, I will defend myself. I’ll yell at you and make you take it back. If you cause any disturbance inside of me, I will make you so sorry.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 74
again. First you defend yourself, and then you protect yourself. You do whatever you can to keep from feeling disturbance.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 74
You only have to be willing to open your heart in the face of anything and everything, and permit the purification process to take place.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 76
Your consciousness leaves the centered position of witnessing the many energies around you, and you get sucked into focusing on just one of them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 76
Things you liked, now look dark and depressing. But nothing has really changed. It’s just that you’re looking at life from that seat of disturbance.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 80
So don’t fall. Let go. No matter what it is, let it go. The bigger it is, the higher the reward of letting go and the worse the fall if you don’t. It’s pretty black-and-white. You either let go or you don’t. There really isn’t anything in between. So let all of your blockages and disturbances become the fuel for the journey. That which is holding you down can become a powerful force</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 81
Real transformation begins when you embrace your problems as agents for growth. In order to understand how this process works, let’s examine the following situation.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 88
This is what you begin to experience if you hang out with the Self instead of hanging out with inner disturbances.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 88
Awareness is simply aware while everything in the universe parades before it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 89
When Buddha said that all of life is suffering, this is what he was referring to. People do not understand how much they are suffering because they have never experienced what it is like to not suffer.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 90
You are either trying to stop suffering, controlling your environment to avoid suffering, or worrying about suffering in the future. This state of affairs is so prevalent that you don’t see it, just as a fish doesn’t see the water.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 91
Inner sensitivity is a symptom of non-well-being. It’s the same as when the body sends pain or displays other symptoms when it’s not well.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 91
Your psyche is communicating through its universal language: fear. Self-consciousness, jealousy, insecurity, anxiety—they are all fear.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 92
What you’ll see is that your mind is always telling you that you have to change something outside in order to solve your inner problems. But if you are wise, you won’t play this game. You’ll realize that the advice your mind is giving you is psychologically damaged advice. Your mind’s thoughts are disturbed by its fears.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 93
The fact is, however, external changes are not going to solve your problem because they don’t address the root of your problem. The root problem is that you don’t feel whole and complete within yourself.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 93
You began with a problem inside yourself, and you tried to solve it by getting involved with somebody else.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 93
Imagine what fun life would be if you didn’t have those neurotic, personal thoughts going on within you. You could enjoy things, and you could actually get to know people instead of needing them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 93
You could just live and experience your life, instead of trying to use life to fix what’s wrong inside of you. You are capable of achieving that state. It’s never too late.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 95
your mind starts telling you what you have to do to make everything inside okay, don’t buy into what it’s</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 95
The truth is, everything will be okay as soon as you are okay with everything. And that’s the only time everything will be okay.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 96
There are billions of people on this planet, and one of them didn’t say hello to you. Are you saying that you can’t handle that? Is that reasonable?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 96
Begin this journey to freedom by regularly reminding yourself to watch the psyche.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 97
Every time you get into your car, as you’re settling into the seat, just stop. Take a moment to remember that you’re spinning on a planet in the middle of empty space. Then remind yourself that you’re not going to get involved in your own melodrama.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 97
Persistently centered consciousness is the seat of Self.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 98
by untethering yourself from the bondage of your psyche,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 98
This freedom is so great it has been given a special name—liberation.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 101
heart. What is that feeling? Why is that happening? People don’t normally ask why; they just try to keep it from happening.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 101
You must go deeper than that and look at the dynamics of the layers that have been created. At the core there is the pain. Then, in order to avoid the pain, you try to stay busy with friends and hide</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 102
sky. You are sitting on a planet spinning around in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Though you can only see a few thousand stars, there are hundreds of billions of stars in our Milky Way Galaxy alone. In fact, it is estimated that there are over a trillion stars in the Spiral Galaxy.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 102
From that perspective, do you really care what people think about your clothes or your car? Do you really need to feel embarrassed if you forget someone’s name?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 102
To spend your life avoiding pain means it’s always right behind you. At any point you could slip and say the wrong thing. At any point anything can happen. So you end up devoting your life to the avoidance of pain.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 103
In essence, you can simply live your life and experience what it’s like to be on a planet that is spinning around in the middle of nowhere, until you die.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 103
If you want to be free, simply view inner pain as a temporary shift in your energy flow.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 103
You cannot spend your life avoiding things that are not actually happening, or everything will become negative.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 103
Probably more than there are stars in the sky. If you want to grow and be free to explore life, you cannot spend your life avoiding the myriad things that might hurt your heart or mind.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 103
You must look inside yourself and determine that from now on pain is not a problem. It is just a thing in the universe.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 103
with it, you will devote your life to avoiding it. If you feel insecurity, it’s just a feeling. You can handle a feeling. If you feel embarrassed, it’s just a feeling. It’s just a part of creation. If you feel jealousy and your heart burns, just look at it objectively, like you would a mild bruise. It’s a thing in the universe that is passing through your system. Laugh at it, have fun with it, but don’t be afraid of</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 103
it. It cannot touch you unless you touch it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 104
Wise beings do not want to remain a slave to the fear of pain. They permit the world to be what it is instead of being afraid of it. They wholeheartedly participate in life, but not for the purpose of using life to avoid themselves.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 104
let it pass through you like the wind.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 105
Just start seeing these inner experiences as energy passing through your heart and before the eye of your consciousness.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 105
relax. Do the opposite of contracting and closing.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 106
If you have any wisdom, you will leave it alone and not try to change your life to avoid it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 106
you. If you do not care, if you are no longer afraid of yourself, you are free.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 106
You will feel everything at a deeper level. You will begin to have truly beautiful experiences rise up within you. Eventually you will understand that there is an ocean of love behind all of this fear and pain.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 112
Imagine that you found yourself in the midst of an open field where the sun was always shining. It was a beautiful place of great light and great openness.</p>
<p>Note:Great analogy</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 116
It’s not really difficult to get past the walls. Time and again, every day, the natural flow of life collides with our walls and tries to tear them down. But time and again, we defend them. You must realize that when you defend yourself, you are really defending your walls.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 120
Since the analytical mind cannot handle the infinite, you created an alternate reality of finite thoughts that can remain fixed within your mind.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 120
This mental model has become your reality. You must now struggle day and night to make the world fit your model, and you label everything that doesn’t fit as wrong, bad, or unfair.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 120
You get frustrated and angry over simple little things. This is the result of being unable to fit what’s actually happening into your model of reality.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 120
In order to truly go beyond your model, you must first understand why you built it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 121
If you really want to see why you do things, then don’t do them and see what happens.</p>
<p>Note:interesting</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 121
The moment somebody starts behaving in a way that is outside your expectations, your mind starts talking. It says, “What should I do about this? I can’t just ignore what he did. I could confront him directly or ask someone else to talk to him.” Your mind is telling you to fix it.</p>
<p>Note:fix it in order to fit into your model</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
This zone is finite. All attempts to stay within it keep you finite. Going beyond always means letting go of the effort to keep things within your defined limits.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
In other words, you can devote your whole life to the process of making sure everything fits within your limited model, or you can devote your life to freeing yourself from the limits of your model.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
But in truth, the confines of your comfort zone create just such a cage. This inner cage doesn’t limit your body; it limits the expanse of your consciousness.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
If you examine this, you will see that you’re willing to stay in this cage because you’re afraid.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
They don’t say, “Get me out of here! I’m locked in this tiny world in which everything has to be a certain way. I have to worry about what everybody’s doing, what I look like, and everything I’ve ever said. I want out.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 123
You see that you’re afraid to tell people what you really think. You see that you’re too self-conscious to freely express yourself.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 124
Spirituality begins when you decide that you’ll never stop trying. Spirituality is the commitment to go beyond,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 126
The day unfolds and the mind doesn’t say anything. You simply interact with the day with a peaceful, fully inspired heart.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 129
on. The more consciousness narrows its focus onto this mental structure, the greater the tendency to utilize it to define the concept of self.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 130
Who are you that is lost and trying to build a concept of yourself in order to be found?</p>
<p>Note:why design a concept of self?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 130
You will never find yourself in what you have built to define yourself. You’re the one who’s doing the building.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 130
In this panic, in this lost state, you learned to cling and hold onto the thoughts and emotions that were passing before you. You used them to build a personality, a persona, a self-concept that would allow you to define yourself.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 131
If you get that model down absolutely right, and behave consistently every time, you have actually “created” someone.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 131
It got engrained in you at a very young age,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 134
the events that happen in the moment belong to the moment. They don’t belong to you.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 135
When your mind is disturbed, don’t ask, “What do I do about this?” Instead ask, “Who am I that notices this?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 136
aware. If you pass through a period of darkness or depression, just ask, “Who is aware of the darkness?” That’s how you pass through the different stages of your inner growth. You just keep letting go, and remain aware that you are still there.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 136
When you’ve let go of the dark psyche, and you’ve let go of the light psyche, and you’re no longer clinging to anything, you will reach a point where it will all open up behind you.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 136
You will then walk through every moment of your daily life with the flow of this inner force sustaining you,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 136
You will still have thoughts, emotions, and a self-concept floating around in inner space, but they will be just one small part of what you experience. You will not identify with anything outside the sense of Self.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 143
Events don’t determine whether or not you’re going to be happy. They’re just events. You determine whether or not you’re going to be happy. You can be happy just to be alive. You can be happy having all these things happen to you, and then be happy to die. If you can live this way, your heart will be so open and your Spirit will be so free, that you will soar up to the heavens.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 143
You’re sitting on a planet spinning around in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Go ahead, take a look at reality. You’re floating in empty space in a universe that goes on forever. If you have to be here, at least be happy and enjoy the experience. You’re going to die anyway. Things are going to happen anyway. Why shouldn’t you be happy?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 144
Every time a part of you begins to get unhappy, let it go. Work with</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 145
The technique of unconditional happiness is ideal because what you’re doing with the rest of your life is already defined—you’re letting go of yourself so that you can remain happy. As far as</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 146
your spirituality goes, you’re going to grow very rapidly.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 146
They’re also going to notice the purification of their mind because they are not getting involved in the mind’s melodrama.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 148
Everything I look at just creates waves of joy inside me.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 148
God in the yogic tradition is Satchitananda—Eternal, Conscious Bliss. God is ecstasy.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 149
If you’re neither pushing life away, nor pulling it toward you, then you are not creating any resistance. You are simply present. In this state, you are just witnessing and experiencing the events of life taking place.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 150
your being. It is what makes your arms and legs move. They don’t just move randomly by themselves. They move the way they do because you assert will to make them do so. You use the same will to hold onto thoughts when you want to concentrate on them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 151
Eventually you’ll see that this resistance is a tremendous waste of energy. The fact is, you’re generally using your will to resist one of two things: that which has already happened or that which hasn’t happened yet.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 151
It is not life’s events that are causing problems or stress. It is your resistance to life’s events that is causing this experience.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 152
This is because we don’t all have the same preconceived notions of how things should be or how much they should matter to us.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 152
If you want to understand stress, begin by realizing that you carry around with you your own set of preconceived notions of how things should be. It is based upon these notions that you assert your will to resist what has already happened. Where did you get these preconceived notions?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 153
begin dealing with each situation with acceptance.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 153
This is because events are not problems; they’re just events. Your resistance to them is what causes the problem. But, again, don’t think that because you</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 153
You will be surprised to find that in most situations there’s nothing to deal with except for your own fears and desires. Fear and desire make everything seem so complicated.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 153
When the events of this world make it through you, you have reached a deep spiritual state. You can then be conscious in the presence of whatever takes place, without building up blocked energies. When you attain that state, everything becomes clear. In contrast, everybody else is attempting to deal with the world around them while struggling with their own reactions and personal preferences. When a person is dealing with their own fears, anxieties, and desires, how much energy is left for dealing with what’s actually happening?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 154
Stop and think about what you’re capable of achieving. Up to now, your capacities have been constrained by constant inner struggles. Imagine what would happen if your awareness was free to focus only on the events actually taking place. You would have no noise going on inside. If you lived like this, you could do anything. Your capabilities would be exponential compared to what you’ve ever experienced. If you could bring this level of awareness and clarity to everything you do, your life would change.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 154
If you’re not trying to make people fit into your preconceived notions of what you like and dislike, you will find that relationships are not really that difficult. If you’re not so busy judging and resisting people based upon what is blocked inside of you, you will find that they are much easier to get along with—and so are you.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 154
Daily work is fun. In fact, it’s easy. Your work is just what you do with yourself during the day while you’re spinning on a planet through empty space. If</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 154
Once the personal energies pass through you, the world becomes a different place. People and events will appear different to you. You will realize that you have talents and abilities you never saw before.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 156
This process of relaxing through resistance is beneficial to everything in your life. This is because it directly addresses how to keep your heart open when it is trying to close. Deep inner release is a spiritual path in and of itself.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 156
It’s the work of a lifetime to become that open, that complete, and that whole.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 156
If you relax and release, you will see that it puts you through tremendous spiritual growth.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 156
You truly can reach a state in which you never have any more stress, tension, or problems for the rest of your life. You just have to realize that life is giving you a gift, and that gift is the flow of events that takes place between your birth and your death.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 156
Learn to stop resisting reality, and what used to look like stressful problems will begin to look like the stepping-stones of your spiritual journey.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 161
The true seeker commits to live like that every moment and lets nothing stop them. Why should anything stop you? You’re just going to die anyway.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 161
You have to understand that it is your attempt to get special experiences from life that makes you miss the actual experience of life. Life is not something you get; it’s something you experience. Life exists with or without you. It has been going on for billions of years. You simply</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 162
You fear death because you crave life. You fear death because you think there’s something to get that you haven’t experienced yet. Many people feel that death will take something away from them. The wise person realizes that death is constantly giving them something. Death is giving meaning to your life. You’re the one who throws your life away; you waste every second of it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 168
is much more efficient to deal with the body in a balanced manner than to be burdened with the effects of the extremes.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 170
For the being who is in the Tao, events take place and last just as long as they are taking place. That’s</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 170
As you let go, it comes back to center. You don’t follow the extremes, so your energy comes back to the current moment.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 170
Now let’s go sailing when there’s tremendous wind but there’s no sail. That is the opposite extreme and, again, we’re not going anywhere. Sailing is such a good example because there are many forces interacting together. There’s the wind, the sail, the rudder, and the tension of the ropes on</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 171
In the Tao, you are blind, and you have to learn how to be blind. You can never see where the Tao is going; you can only be there with it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 174
You don’t feel resentment toward people. You don’t close or get tight as often. Things still happen that you don’t want to happen, but they don’t seem to touch you as much.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 174
As you associate less with the physical and psychological parts of your being, you begin to identify more with the flow of pure energy.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 174
Your backdrop is openness, beauty, and appreciation.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 175
You don’t have to make yourself feel that way; that is how Spirit feels.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 175
how the body normally feels, you might say that it’s generally uncomfortable about one thing or another. How about the psyche? If you were being totally honest, you’d probably say that it’s generally full of complaints and fears. Well, how does Spirit normally feel? The truth is, it always feels good. It always feels high. It always feels open and light.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 175
As you let go and willingly release the physical, emotional, and mental aspects of your being, Spirit becomes your state.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 177
When you walk through a beautiful botanical garden, you feel open and light. You feel love. You see beauty.</p>

You cannot spend your life avoiding things that are not actually happening, or everything will become negative.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 103
Probably more than there are stars in the sky. If you want to grow and be free to explore life, you cannot spend your life avoiding the myriad things that might hurt your heart or mind.</p>

Since the analytical mind cannot handle the infinite, you created an alternate reality of finite thoughts that can remain fixed within your mind.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 120
This mental model has become your reality. You must now struggle day and night to make the world fit your model, and you label everything that doesn’t fit as wrong, bad, or unfair.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 120
You get frustrated and angry over simple little things. This is the result of being unable to fit what’s actually happening into your model of reality.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 120
In order to truly go beyond your model, you must first understand why you built it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 121
If you really want to see why you do things, then don’t do them and see what happens.</p>
<p>Note:interesting</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 121
The moment somebody starts behaving in a way that is outside your expectations, your mind starts talking. It says, “What should I do about this? I can’t just ignore what he did. I could confront him directly or ask someone else to talk to him.” Your mind is telling you to fix it.</p>
<p>Note:fix it in order to fit into your model</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
This zone is finite. All attempts to stay within it keep you finite. Going beyond always means letting go of the effort to keep things within your defined limits.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
In other words, you can devote your whole life to the process of making sure everything fits within your limited model, or you can devote your life to freeing yourself from the limits of your model.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
But in truth, the confines of your comfort zone create just such a cage. This inner cage doesn’t limit your body; it limits the expanse of your consciousness.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
If you examine this, you will see that you’re willing to stay in this cage because you’re afraid.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
They don’t say, “Get me out of here! I’m locked in this tiny world in which everything has to be a certain way. I have to worry about what everybody’s doing, what I look like, and everything I’ve ever said. I want out.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 123
You see that you’re afraid to tell people what you really think. You see that you’re too self-conscious to freely express yourself.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 124
Spirituality begins when you decide that you’ll never stop trying. Spirituality is the commitment to go beyond,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 126
The day unfolds and the mind doesn’t say anything. You simply interact with the day with a peaceful, fully inspired heart.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 129
on. The more consciousness narrows its focus onto this mental structure, the greater the tendency to utilize it to define the concept of self.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 130
Who are you that is lost and trying to build a concept of yourself in order to be found?</p>
<p>Note:why design a concept of self?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 130
You will never find yourself in what you have built to define yourself. You’re the one who’s doing the building.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 130
In this panic, in this lost state, you learned to cling and hold onto the thoughts and emotions that were passing before you. You used them to build a personality, a persona, a self-concept that would allow you to define yourself.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 131
If you get that model down absolutely right, and behave consistently every time, you have actually “created” someone.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 131
It got engrained in you at a very young age,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 134
the events that happen in the moment belong to the moment. They don’t belong to you.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 135
When your mind is disturbed, don’t ask, “What do I do about this?” Instead ask, “Who am I that notices this?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 136
aware. If you pass through a period of darkness or depression, just ask, “Who is aware of the darkness?” That’s how you pass through the different stages of your inner growth. You just keep letting go, and remain aware that you are still there.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 136
When you’ve let go of the dark psyche, and you’ve let go of the light psyche, and you’re no longer clinging to anything, you will reach a point where it will all open up behind you.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 136
You will then walk through every moment of your daily life with the flow of this inner force sustaining you,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 136
You will still have thoughts, emotions, and a self-concept floating around in inner space, but they will be just one small part of what you experience. You will not identify with anything outside the sense of Self.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 143
Events don’t determine whether or not you’re going to be happy. They’re just events. You determine whether or not you’re going to be happy. You can be happy just to be alive. You can be happy having all these things happen to you, and then be happy to die. If you can live this way, your heart will be so open and your Spirit will be so free, that you will soar up to the heavens.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 143
You’re sitting on a planet spinning around in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Go ahead, take a look at reality. You’re floating in empty space in a universe that goes on forever. If you have to be here, at least be happy and enjoy the experience. You’re going to die anyway. Things are going to happen anyway. Why shouldn’t you be happy?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 144
Every time a part of you begins to get unhappy, let it go. Work with</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 145
The technique of unconditional happiness is ideal because what you’re doing with the rest of your life is already defined—you’re letting go of yourself so that you can remain happy. As far as</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 146
your spirituality goes, you’re going to grow very rapidly.</p>

They’re also going to notice the purification of their mind because they are not getting involved in the mind’s melodrama.</p>

Everything I look at just creates waves of joy inside me.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 149
If you’re neither pushing life away, nor pulling it toward you, then you are not creating any resistance. You are simply present. In this state, you are just witnessing and experiencing the events of life taking place.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 150
your being. It is what makes your arms and legs move. They don’t just move randomly by themselves. They move the way they do because you assert will to make them do so. You use the same will to hold onto thoughts when you want to concentrate on them.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 151
Eventually you’ll see that this resistance is a tremendous waste of energy. The fact is, you’re generally using your will to resist one of two things: that which has already happened or that which hasn’t happened yet.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 151
It is not life’s events that are causing problems or stress. It is your resistance to life’s events that is causing this experience.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 152
This is because we don’t all have the same preconceived notions of how things should be or how much they should matter to us.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 152
If you want to understand stress, begin by realizing that you carry around with you your own set of preconceived notions of how things should be. It is based upon these notions that you assert your will to resist what has already happened. Where did you get these preconceived notions?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 153
begin dealing with each situation with acceptance.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 153
This is because events are not problems; they’re just events. Your resistance to them is what causes the problem. But, again, don’t think that because you</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 153
You will be surprised to find that in most situations there’s nothing to deal with except for your own fears and desires. Fear and desire make everything seem so complicated.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 153
When the events of this world make it through you, you have reached a deep spiritual state. You can then be conscious in the presence of whatever takes place, without building up blocked energies. When you attain that state, everything becomes clear. In contrast, everybody else is attempting to deal with the world around them while struggling with their own reactions and personal preferences. When a person is dealing with their own fears, anxieties, and desires, how much energy is left for dealing with what’s actually happening?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 154
Stop and think about what you’re capable of achieving. Up to now, your capacities have been constrained by constant inner struggles. Imagine what would happen if your awareness was free to focus only on the events actually taking place. You would have no noise going on inside. If you lived like this, you could do anything. Your capabilities would be exponential compared to what you’ve ever experienced. If you could bring this level of awareness and clarity to everything you do, your life would change.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 154
If you’re not trying to make people fit into your preconceived notions of what you like and dislike, you will find that relationships are not really that difficult. If you’re not so busy judging and resisting people based upon what is blocked inside of you, you will find that they are much easier to get along with—and so are you.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 154
Daily work is fun. In fact, it’s easy. Your work is just what you do with yourself during the day while you’re spinning on a planet through empty space. If</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 154
Once the personal energies pass through you, the world becomes a different place. People and events will appear different to you. You will realize that you have talents and abilities you never saw before.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 156
This process of relaxing through resistance is beneficial to everything in your life. This is because it directly addresses how to keep your heart open when it is trying to close. Deep inner release is a spiritual path in and of itself.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 156
It’s the work of a lifetime to become that open, that complete, and that whole.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 156
If you relax and release, you will see that it puts you through tremendous spiritual growth.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 156
You truly can reach a state in which you never have any more stress, tension, or problems for the rest of your life. You just have to realize that life is giving you a gift, and that gift is the flow of events that takes place between your birth and your death.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 156
Learn to stop resisting reality, and what used to look like stressful problems will begin to look like the stepping-stones of your spiritual journey.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 161
The true seeker commits to live like that every moment and lets nothing stop them. Why should anything stop you? You’re just going to die anyway.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 161
You have to understand that it is your attempt to get special experiences from life that makes you miss the actual experience of life. Life is not something you get; it’s something you experience. Life exists with or without you. It has been going on for billions of years. You simply</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 162
You fear death because you crave life. You fear death because you think there’s something to get that you haven’t experienced yet. Many people feel that death will take something away from them. The wise person realizes that death is constantly giving them something. Death is giving meaning to your life. You’re the one who throws your life away; you waste every second of it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 168
is much more efficient to deal with the body in a balanced manner than to be burdened with the effects of the extremes.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 170
For the being who is in the Tao, events take place and last just as long as they are taking place. That’s</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 170
As you let go, it comes back to center. You don’t follow the extremes, so your energy comes back to the current moment.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 170
Now let’s go sailing when there’s tremendous wind but there’s no sail. That is the opposite extreme and, again, we’re not going anywhere. Sailing is such a good example because there are many forces interacting together. There’s the wind, the sail, the rudder, and the tension of the ropes on</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 171
In the Tao, you are blind, and you have to learn how to be blind. You can never see where the Tao is going; you can only be there with it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 174
You don’t feel resentment toward people. You don’t close or get tight as often. Things still happen that you don’t want to happen, but they don’t seem to touch you as much.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 174
As you associate less with the physical and psychological parts of your being, you begin to identify more with the flow of pure energy.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 174
Your backdrop is openness, beauty, and appreciation.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 175
You don’t have to make yourself feel that way; that is how Spirit feels.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 175
how the body normally feels, you might say that it’s generally uncomfortable about one thing or another. How about the psyche? If you were being totally honest, you’d probably say that it’s generally full of complaints and fears. Well, how does Spirit normally feel? The truth is, it always feels good. It always feels high. It always feels open and light.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 175
As you let go and willingly release the physical, emotional, and mental aspects of your being, Spirit becomes your state.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 177
When you walk through a beautiful botanical garden, you feel open and light. You feel love. You see beauty.</p>

forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.</p>

But I was aware that in those few minutes fate had passed me in many different forms.</p>

“I did not threaten him; I only showed surprise in still finding him here when I planned to meet him tonight in Teheran,” said Death.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 66
The camp inmate was frightened of making decisions and of taking any sort of initiative whatsoever. This was the result of a strong feeling that fate was one’s master, and that one must not try to influence it in any way, but instead let it take its own course.</p>

We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 75
there were always choices to make. Every day, every hour,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 75
offered the opportunity to make a decision, a decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom; which determined whether or not you would become the plaything of circumstance, renouncing freedom and dignity to become molded into the form of the typical inmate. Seen from this point of view, the</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 75
insufficient food and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 75
in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 75
any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him—mentally and spiritually.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 75
camp. Dostoevski said once, “There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.” These</p>

the last inner freedom cannot be lost.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 75
It is this spiritual freedom—which cannot be taken away—that makes life meaningful and purposeful.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 76
Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 76
this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 76
Of the prisoners only a few kept their full inner liberty and obtained those values which their suffering afforded, but even one such example is sufficient proof that man’s inner strength may raise him above his outward fate.</p>

Everywhere man is confronted with fate, with the chance of achieving something through his own suffering.</p>

We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily and hourly.</p>

Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.</p>

When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe.</p>

Logotherapy focuses rather on the future, that is to say, on the meanings to be fulfilled by the patient in his future.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 104
this striving to find a meaning in one’s life is the primary motivational force in man.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 104
a will to meaning in contrast to the pleasure principle (or, as we could also term it, the will to pleasure) on which Freudian psychoanalysis is centered, as well as in contrast to the will to power on which Adlerian psychology, using the term “striving for superiority,” is focused.</p>

Not every conflict is necessarily neurotic; some amount of conflict is normal and healthy.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 108
being. Logotherapy deviates from psychoanalysis insofar as it considers man a being whose main concern consists in fulfilling a meaning, rather than in the mere gratification and satisfaction of drives and instincts, or in merely reconciling the conflicting claims of id, ego and superego, or in the mere adaptation and adjustment to society and environment.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 110
I consider it a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to assume that what man needs in the first place is equilibrium or, as it is called in biology, “homeostasis,” i.e., a tensionless state.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 110
man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.</p>

Schopenhauer when he said that mankind was apparently doomed to vacillate eternally between the two extremes of distress and boredom.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 112
That is why existential frustration often eventuates in sexual compensation. We can observe in such cases that the sexual libido becomes rampant in the existential vacuum.</p>

“Every therapy must in some way, no matter how restricted, also be logotherapy.”</p>

To put the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess champion: “Tell me, Master, what is the best move in the world?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 113
In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. Thus, logotherapy sees in responsibleness the very essence of human existence.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 114
“Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 114
there is nothing which would stimulate a man’s sense of responsibleness more than this maxim,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 114
invites him to imagine first that the present is past and, second, that the past may yet be changed and amended. Such a precept confronts him with life’s finiteness as well as the finality of what he makes out of both his life and himself.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 114
Logotherapy tries to make the patient fully aware of his own responsibleness;</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 114
a logotherapist is the least tempted of all psychotherapists to impose value judgments on his patients,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 114
A painter tries to convey to us a picture of the world as he sees it; an ophthalmologist tries to enable us to see the world as it really is.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 115
The logotherapist’s role consists of widening and broadening the visual field of the patient so that the whole spectrum of potential meaning becomes conscious and visible to him.</p>

“the self-transcendence of human existence.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 115
The more one forgets himself—by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love—the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 115
In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 115
ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 116
No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 116
Love is as primary a phenomenon as sex.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 116
Thus love is not understood as a mere side-effect of sex; rather, sex is a way of expressing the experience of that ultimate togetherness which is called love.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 116
For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 117
suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 117
I could not change his fate; I could not revive his wife. But in that moment I did succeed in changing his attitude toward his unalterable fate inasmuch as from that time on he could at least see a meaning in his suffering.</p>

basic tenets of logotherapy that man’s main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life.</p>

In accepting this challenge to suffer bravely, life has a meaning up to the last moment, and it retains this meaning literally to the end.</p>

Are you sure that the human world is a terminal point in the evolution of the cosmos? Is it not conceivable that there is still another dimension, a world beyond man’s world; a world in which the question of an ultimate meaning of human suffering would find an answer?”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
What is demanded of man is not, as some existential philosophers teach, to endure the meaninglessness of life,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 122
but rather to bear his incapacity to grasp its unconditional meaningfulness in rational terms. Logos is deeper than logic.</p>

“Why do we speak of the good Lord?” Whereupon I said, “Some weeks ago, you were suffering from measles, and then the good Lord sent you full recovery.” However, the little girl was not content; she retorted, “Well, but please, Daddy, do not forget: in the first place, he had sent me the measles.”</p>

Thus, the transitoriness of our existence in no way makes it meaningless. But it does constitute our responsibleness; for everything hinges upon our realizing the essentially transitory possibilities.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 124
At any moment, man must decide, for better or for worse, what will be the monument of his existence.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 124
should say having been is the surest kind of being.</p>

Logotherapy, keeping in mind the essential transitoriness of human existence, is not pessimistic but rather activistic.</p>

He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old?</p>

“The wish is father to the thought” to “The fear is mother of the event.” Ironically enough,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 125
Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 126
This anticipatory anxiety resulted both in excessive intention to confirm her femininity and excessive attention centered upon herself rather than upon her partner.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 126
Logotherapy bases its technique called “paradoxical intention” on the twofold fact that fear brings about that which one is afraid of, and that hyper-intention makes impossible what one wishes.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 127
In this approach the phobic patient is invited to intend, even if only for a moment, precisely that which he</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 127
fears.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 127
The reader will note that this procedure consists of a reversal of the patient’s attitude, inasmuch as his fear is replaced by a paradoxical wish.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 127
By this treatment, the wind is taken out of the sails of the anxiety.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 127
however, must make use of the specifically human capacity for self-detachment inherent in a sense of humor.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 127
basic capacity to detach one from oneself is actualized whenever the logotherapeutic technique called paradoxical intention is applied.</p>

Without meaning to, he had practiced paradoxical intention, though not for therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 129
The fear of sleeplessness13 results in a hyper-intention to fall asleep, which, in turn, incapacitates the patient to do so. To overcome this particular fear, I usually advise the patient not to try to sleep but rather to try to do just the opposite, that is, to stay awake as long as possible.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 129
the hyper-intention to fall asleep, arising from the anticipatory anxiety of not being able to do so, must be replaced by the paradoxical intention not to fall asleep, which soon will be followed by sleep.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 130
traditional psychotherapy has insisted that therapeutic practices have to be based on findings on etiology,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 130
possible</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 130
certain factors might cause neuroses during early childhood and that entirely different factors might relieve neuroses during adulthood.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 130
A similar chain of events, however, can be observed in obsessive-compulsive cases in which the patient fights the ideas which haunt him.16 Thereby, however, he increases their power to disturb him, since pressure precipitates counterpressure.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 131
On the other hand, as soon as the patient stops fighting his obsessions and instead tries to ridicule them by dealing with them in an ironical way—by applying paradoxical intention—the vicious circle is cut, the symptom diminishes and finally atrophies.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 131
As we see, anticipatory anxiety has to be counteracted by paradoxical intention; hyper-intention as well as hyper-reflection have to be counteracted by dereflection;</p>

Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 139
question, How is it possible to say yes to life in spite of all that? How, to pose the question differently, can life retain its potential meaning in spite of its tragic aspects?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 139
And this in turn presupposes the human capacity to creatively turn life’s negative aspects into something positive or constructive.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 140
(1) turning suffering into a human achievement and accomplishment; (2) deriving from guilt the opportunity to change oneself for the better; and (3) deriving from life’s transitoriness an incentive to take responsible action.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 140
But happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 140
As we see, a human being is not one in pursuit of happiness but rather in search of a reason to become happy,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 140
actualizing the potential meaning inherent and dormant in a given situation.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 140
This need for a reason is similar in another specifically human phenomenon—laughter. If you want anyone to laugh you have to provide him with a reason, e.g., you have to tell him a joke.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 140
In no way is it possible to evoke real laughter by urging him, or having him urge himself, to laugh.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 141
Indeed, what is called “the pleasure principle” is, rather, a fun-spoiler.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 141
Once an individual’s search for a meaning is successful, it not only renders him happy but also gives him the capability to cope with suffering.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 141
In fact, the drug scene is one aspect of a more general mass phenomenon, namely the feeling of meaninglessness resulting from a frustration of our existential needs which in turn has become a universal phenomenon in our industrial societies.</p>

I addressed the prisoners in San Quentin, I told them that “you are human beings like me, and as such you were free to commit a crime, to become guilty.

A book called The Quimby Manuscripts,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,261
Dr. Quimby diagnosed her case as a mind cloudy and stagnated, due to excitation and fear, caused by the inability to see clearly the meaning of the passage of the Bible, which she had been reading.</p>

Scientists inform us that you build a new body every eleven months;</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,439
Your dominant idea, which would be the picture of falling, would conquer.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,442
your subconscious is always controlled by the dominant idea. Your subconscious will accept the stronger of two contradictory propositions. The effortless way is the better.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,445
Never try to compel the subconscious mind to accept your idea by exercising will power.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,450
This is an example of the law of reversed effort whereby you get the opposite of what you asked or prayed for.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,458
The reason for this is that the highest degree of outcropping of the subconscious occurs prior to sleep and just after we awaken.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,476
Mental coercion or too much effort shows anxiety and fear, which block your answer. Easy does it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,477
When your mind is relaxed and you accept an idea, your subconscious goes to work to execute the idea.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,478
Think and plan independently of traditional methods. Know that there is always an answer and a solution to every problem.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,479
Do not be overly concerned with the beating of your heart, with the breathing of your lungs, or the functions of any part of your anatomy. Lean heavily upon your subconscious and proclaim frequently that Divine right action is taking place.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,482
Imagination is your most powerful faculty. Imagine what is lovely and of good report. You are what you imagine yourself to be.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,483
You avoid conflict between your conscious and subconscious in the sleepy state. Imagine the fulfillment of your desire over and over again prior to sleep. Sleep in peace and wake in joy.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,488
Do the thing you love to do, and do it for the joy and thrill of it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,513
Your affirmation succeeds best when it is specific and when it does not produce a mental conflict or argument;</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,514
The dominant idea or belief is always accepted by the subconscious mind.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,517
“By day and by night I am being prospered in all of my interests.” This affirmation will not arouse any argument because it does not contradict your subconscious mind’s impression of financial lack.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,546
The way to overcome this emotion is to say to yourself, “Isn’t it wonderful! I rejoice in that man’s prosperity. I wish for him greater and greater</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,547
To entertain envious thoughts is devastating because it places you in a very negative position; therefore, wealth flows from you instead of to you.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,549
This will neutralize the negative thoughts in your mind and cause an ever greater measure of wealth to flow to you by the law of your own subconscious mind.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,557
Decide to be wealthy the easy way, with the infallible aid of your subconscious mind.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,558
Trying to accumulate wealth by the sweat of your brow and hard labor is one way to become the richest man in the graveyard. You do not have to strive or slave hard.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,560
Wealth is a subconscious conviction. Build into your mentality the idea of wealth.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,560
The trouble with most people is that they have no invisible means of support.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,563
The feeling of wealth produces wealth. Keep this in mind at all times.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,564
The dominant idea is always accepted by your subconscious mind.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,565
You can overcome any mental conflict regarding wealth by affirming frequently,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,571
Your true source of wealth consists of the ideas in your mind.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,573
The block to wealth is in your own mind. Destroy that block now by getting on good mental terms with everyone.</p>

You are here to grow, expand, and unfold spiritually, mentally, and materially.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,671
You want all the money you need to do all the things you want to do and when you want to do them. Get acquainted with the riches of your subconscious mind.</p>

A successful man possesses great psychological and spiritual understanding.</p>

If you imagine an objective clearly, you will be provided with the necessities through the wonder-working power of your subconscious mind.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,832
Your thought fused with feeling becomes a subjective belief, and according to your belief is it done unto you.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,833
The power of sustained imagination draws forth the miracle-working powers of your subconscious mind.</p>

Make the picture vivid and real. Hear the voice, see the gestures, and feel the reality of it all.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,837
Your subconscious mind is a storehouse of memory. For a perfect memory, affirm frequently:</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,887
and sharp, fast thinking commissars.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,952
By giving your conscious attention and devotion to the solution of a perplexing problem, your subconscious mind gathers all the necessary information and presents it</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,957
You delay the answer by thinking it will take a long time or that it is a major problem.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,960
Any mental picture, backed by faith and perseverance, will come to pass through the miracle-working power of your subconscious.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 1,961
Your subconscious is the storehouse of memory, and within your subconscious are recorded all your experiences since childhood.</p>

What the other person says or does cannot really annoy or irritate you except you permit him to disturb you.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,428
The only way he can annoy you is through your own thought.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,428
For example, if you get angry, you have to go through four stages in your mind: You begin to think about what he said. You decide to get angry and generate an emotion of rage. Then, you decide to act. Perhaps, you talk back and react in kind. You see that the thought, emotion, reaction, and action all take place in your mind.</p>

Identify yourself with your aim in life, and do not permit any person, place, or thing to deflect you from your inner sense of peace, tranquility, and radiant health.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,434
Sigmund Freud, the Austrian founder of psychoanalysis, said that unless the personality has love, it sickens and dies. Love includes understanding, good will, and respect for the divinity in the other person.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,462
this is called empathy, which simply means the imaginative projection of your mental attitude into that of another.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,486
You are responsible for the way you think about the other.</p>

Remember, the other person is not responsible for the way you think about him.</p>

7. Become emotionally mature and permit other people to differ from you. They have a perfect right to disagree with you, and you have the same freedom to disagree with them. You can disagree without being disagreeable.</p>

Your inner speech, representing your silent thoughts and feelings, is experienced in the reactions of others toward you.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,492
Wish for the other what you wish for yourself. This is the key to harmonious human relations.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,494
The other person cannot annoy you or irritate you except you permit him.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,494
Your thought is creative; you can bless him. If someone calls you a skunk, you have the freedom to say to the other, “God’s peace fills your soul.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,497
You would not hate a hunchback or cripple. You would have compassion. Have compassion and understanding for mental hunchbacks who have been conditioned negatively. To understand all is to forgive all.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,498
Rejoice in the success, promotion, and good fortune of the other. In doing so, you attract good fortune to yourself.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 2,540
Forgiveness is to forgive yourself. Forgiveness is getting your thoughts in line with the divine law of harmony.</p>

What is your purpose? What are you here to do? Because purpose helps you answer the question “To be or to do?” quite easily.</p>

Wooden at UCLA, used one word to describe the style of his famous coach: “dispassionate.”</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 46
What is really called for in these circumstances is clarity, deliberateness, and methodological determination.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 48
Passion typically masks a weakness. Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance. You need to be able to spot this in others and in yourself, because while the origins of passion may be earnest and good, its effects are comical and then monstrous.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 49
What humans require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose, you could say, is like passion with boundaries. Realism is detachment and perspective.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 49
More than purpose, we also need realism. Where do we start? What do we do first? What do we do right now? How are we sure that what we’re doing is moving us forward? What are we benchmarking ourselves against?</p>

When you are just starting out, we can be sure of a few fundamental realities: 1) You’re not nearly as good or as important as you think you are; 2) You have an attitude that needs to be readjusted; 3) Most of what you think you know or most of what you learned in books or in school is out of date or wrong.</p>

Obeisance is the way forward.</p>

Greatness comes from humble beginnings; it comes from grunt work. It means you’re the least important person in the room—until you change that with results.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 56
Imagine if for every person you met, you thought of some way to help them, something you could do for them? And you looked at it in a way that entirely benefited them and not you. The cumulative effect this would have over time would be profound: You’d learn a great deal by solving diverse problems. You’d develop a reputation for being indispensable.</p>

It is not enough only to be a student at the beginning. It is a position that one has to assume for life. Learn from everyone and everything. From the people you beat, and the people who beat you, from the people you dislike, even from your supposed enemies. At every step and every juncture in life, there is the opportunity to learn—and even if the lesson is purely remedial, we must not let ego block us from hearing it again.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 105
Put yourself in rooms where you’re the least knowledgeable person. That uncomfortable feeling, that defensiveness that you feel when your most deeply held assumptions are challenged—what about subjecting yourself to it deliberately? Change your mind. Change your surroundings.</p>

The founding of a company, making money in the market, or the formation of an idea is messy.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 111
Reducing it to a narrative retroactively creates a clarity that never was and never will be there.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 111
When we are aspiring we must resist the impulse to reverse engineer success from other people’s stories. When we achieve our own, we must resist the desire to pretend that everything unfolded exactly as we’d planned. There was no grand narrative.</p>

The same goes for us, whatever we do. Instead of pretending that we are living some great story, we must remain focused on the execution—and on executing with excellence. We must shun the false crown and continue working on what got us here. Because that’s the only thing that will keep us here.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 115
That’s how it seems to go: we’re never happy with what we have, we want what others have too. We want to have more than everyone else. We start out knowing what is important to us, but once we’ve achieved it, we lose sight of our priorities. Ego sways us, and can ruin us.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 116
All of us waste precious life doing things we don’t like, to prove ourselves to people we don’t respect, and to get things we don’t want.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 117
On an individual level, however, it’s absolutely critical that you know who you’re competing with and why, that you have a clear sense of the space you’re in.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 117
it is the sense of our own path and how to stay on it without getting distracted by all the others that intersect it. In other words, it’s not about beating the other guy. It’s not about having more than the others. It’s about being what you are, and being as good as possible at it, without succumbing to all the things that draw you away from it. It’s about going where you set out to go. About accomplishing the most that you’re capable of in what you choose. That’s it.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
It’s time to sit down and think about what’s truly important to you and then take steps to forsake the rest. Without this, success will not be pleasurable, or nearly as complete as it could be. Or worse, it won’t last.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
Ego rejects trade-offs. Why compromise? Ego wants it all.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
So why do you do what you do? That’s the question you need to answer.</p>

Achieving success involved ignoring the doubts and reservations of the people around us. It meant rejecting rejection. It required taking certain risks. We could have given up at any time, but we’re here precisely because we didn’t.</p>

In a similar position, we might have sprung into “bold” action; we might have gotten angry or drawn a line in the sand. We have to stand up for ourselves, right? But do we? So often, this is just ego, escalating tension more than dealing with it.</p>

They focus, in short, on hard assets instead of soft assets. This is a mistake. We’re not suggesting you be a starving, unshaven graduate student forever; you do need to earn money and build economic assets. But as much as you can, prioritize plans that offer the best chance at learning</p>

make the headline of your LinkedIn profile not a specific job title (e.g., “VP of Marketing at Company X”) but personal-brand or asset-focused (e.g., “Entrepreneur. Product Strategist. Investor.”).</p>

This way, you’ll have a professional identity that you can carry with you as you shift jobs. You own yourself. It’s the start-up of you.</p>

I learned that product/market fit—the focus of product management—mattered more than user experience or design.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 67
And because product management is vital in any product organization, work experience in the area tends to lead to more diverse career opportunities.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 67
It’s a common catch-22: for jobs that require prior experience, how do you get the experience the first time?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 67
My solution: do the job for free on the side. I sought out the head of product management within the eWorld group at Apple, James Isaacs, and told him I had a few product ideas. I offered to write them up in addition to everything else I was doing, and I did. Product managers reviewed my ideas and gave me feedback and encouragement.</p>

All important lessons I wouldn’t have gained any way other than by setting foot in the industry.</p>

The reason many people do not embrace trial and error, learning by doing, adaptation, and the other themes of this chapter is because these strategies introduce real uncertainty. It’s easy to say “learn by doing”—but what if you’re not sure what you’ll learn or what you should do?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 78
Make a plan to develop more transferable skills, those skills and experiences that are broadly useful to potential other jobs.</p>

Research shows that a team in the business world will tend to perform at the level of the worst individual team member.</p>

The first is seeing the world from the other person’s perspective. No one knows this better than the skilled entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 93
The second requirement is thinking about how you can help and collaborate with the other person rather than thinking about what you can get from him or her.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 93
think about how you can help first.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 93
A study on negotiation found that a key difference between skilled negotiators and average negotiators was the time spent searching for shared</p>

“In a business that is so crazy, to actually know that there is somebody who is really smart, who you care about, who has your interests, and who is rowing in the same direction, is something of immense value.” That’s an ally.</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 104
In other words, as the score keeping becomes less and less formal and as the expectation for reciprocal exchange stretches over a longer and longer period of time, a relationship goes from being an exchange partnership to being a true alliance.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 105
The friends you don’t know very well are the ones who refer winning jobs.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 105
In contrast, weak ties usually sit outside of the inner circle. You’re not necessarily going to introduce a looser connection to all of your other friends. Thus, there’s a greater likelihood a weak tie will be exposed to new information or a job opportunity.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 106
what is valuable is the breadth and reach of your network.</p>

garnered the highest response rates included phrases like “You mention …” or “I noticed that …” or “I’m curious what.…”17 In other words, phrases that showed that the person had carefully read the other’s profile. People do this in online dating, but when it comes to professional correspondence, for whatever reason, it doesn’t get done.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 117
and generic requests. If you spend thirty minutes researching a person in your extended network (LinkedIn is a great place to start), and tailor your request for an introduction to something you’ve learned, your request will stand out.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 118
In contrast, the social networks of the people behind successful productions had a healthy balance: some of the people involved had preexisting relationships and some didn’t. There were some strong ties, some weak ties. There was some established trust among the producers, but also enough new blood in the system to generate new ideas.</p>

“Tell me more about your skills, interests, and background.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 123
To give helpful help you need to have a sense of your friend’s values and priorities so that your offer of help can be relevant and specific.</p>

Look at your calendar for the past six months and identify the five people you spend the most time with—are you happy with the influence those five people are having on you?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 138
Introduce two people you know who do not know each other. Make sure the intro will be useful to both sides. (Visit startupofyou.com if you need help on how to craft the actual introduction email.) Then think about a challenge you are dealing with and ask an existing connection for an introduction to someone who could help. Jump-start the process by offering a small gift (such as a relevant article) to the person you want to meet.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 138
Imagine you got laid off from your job today. Who are the ten people you’d email to solicit their advice on what to do next? Reach out to them now, when you don’t need anything specifically.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 138
Pick one person in your network who is a weaker tie but with whom you might like to have a stronger alliance. Commit to trying to help him or her proactively by giving small gifts. These can be anything from sending the person an</p>

Create an “interesting people fund” to which you automatically funnel a certain percentage of your paycheck. Use it to pay for coffees, lunches, and the occasional plane ticket to meet new people and shore up existing relationships.</p>

Shared experiences lead to trust, which leads to people’s sharing information and opportunities.</p>

When you feel like you’re going nowhere. When you may be short on funds or allies or both. When no one is knocking at your door inviting you to stuff. These situations call for the most entrepreneurial opportunity-generating strategy of this chapter: hustle.</p>

Potentially. When you have no resources, you create them. When you have no choice but to fight, you fight hard. When you have no choice but to create, you create.</p>

“To keep our ancestors alive, Mother Nature evolved a brain that routinely tricked them into making three mistakes: overestimating threats, underestimating opportunities, and underestimating resources (for dealing with threats and fulfilling opportunities).” The result is that we’re programmed to overestimate the risk in any given situation.2</p>

Anxiety about how your boss will react to an unconventional proposal will overpower feelings of optimism that he’ll be impressed by your work.</p>

You’ll never be fully certain. Don’t conflate uncertainty with risk.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 182
But the biggest and best opportunities frequently are the ones with the most question marks. Don’t let uncertainty lull you into overestimating the risk.</p>
